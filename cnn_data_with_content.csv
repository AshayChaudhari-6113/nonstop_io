Israel and Hamas agree to breakthrough deal on hostage release and four-day truce," Israel and Hamas have reached a deal for a four-day pause in fighting and the release of at least 50 women and children held hostage in Gaza, marking a major diplomatic breakthrough nearly seven weeks after the start of a conflict that has spiraled into a grave humanitarian crisis in the enclave. The deal, as laid out by key negotiator Qatar in a statement, would see hostages held captive by Hamas released in exchange for a number of Palestinian women and children in Israeli jails. The truce, meanwhile, would also allow the entry of “a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid,” the statement said. The starting time of the pause in fighting would be announced within the next 24 hours, the statement added. An Israeli official told CNN Wednesday that the truce is slated to begin at 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) on Thursday. There is an option for the pause to last as long as 10 days, but Israeli officials believe it is unlikely to last that long. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said when the deal was approved that for every additional 10 hostages who are released, there will be an additional day of a pause in the fighting. The US and Israel will also both pause drone flights over Gaza for six hours each day as part of the deal to secure the release of 50 women and children hostages from Gaza, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN. Qatar’s lead negotiator Minister of State Mohammed Al-Khulaifi said the agreement should prompt the international community to “seize this brief window of opportunity to generate further momentum for the diplomatic track.” The announcement has been greeted with relief and heightened anticipation from the families of those taken hostage, who now await further news about their loved ones. It has also been met with positive reaction on the international stage. Egyptian President Abdelfattah El-Sisi reiterated Egypt’s commitment to finding a “sustainable” solution for the Palestinian people, while Qatar’s prime minister said his country hopes the development will establish “a comprehensive and sustainable agreement that will put an end to the war and the bloodshed.” Jordan’s foreign ministry said it hopes the foreign-mediated deal will be a “step” that leads to a “complete cessation of the war” in Gaza. In Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov welcomed the deal, saying that Moscow views it “positively” and describing it as “the first good news from Gaza in a very long time.” A source familiar with how hostages are expected to leave Gaza told CNN that the first swap is expected to take place Thursday 10 a.m. Israeli time. Some 50 Israel hostages – including some with dual nationalities – are expected to be released over the four-day pause. Ten is the minimum number of hostages to be released each day, but that could be higher. “The first swap is the most crucial to see that the mechanism is working as was agreed,” the source said. Every evening before the next day’s release, Israel and Hamas will give the Red Cross the list of hostage and prisoner names being released the next day, they added. Hostages will be brought by the Red Cross to Rafah where they will be met by specially trained Israeli soldiers. They will verify that the hostages released were the ones expected and on the list. The families of the hostages will not be notified until the identities of the hostages released have been confirmed, the source said. Hostages will then be taken by helicopter to several designated hospitals in Israel where there will be special areas and rooms for the hostages, closed to the public. There, their families will finally be able to see them after over six weeks in captivity. Hamas is holding 239 hostages captive in Gaza, including foreign nationals from 26 countries, according to figures from the Israeli military. The mass abductions at gunpoint took place during October 7, when Hamas militants struck across the border in a coordinated and bloody surprise attack killing around 1,200 people – the largest such attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948. Prior to the deal, only a handful of hostages had been released. Israel responded to the attack by declaring war against Hamas and imposing a blockade on Gaza that cut off supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel, while launching a relentless air and ground assault. Some 12,700 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to data from the Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank, which draws on information from Hamas-run health authorities. The newly announced deal followed weeks of negotiations that included the United States and Egypt, and was approved by Israel’s cabinet in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a six-hour meeting an Israeli official described as  “tense and emotional.” Some 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released over four days during the initial hostage release if terms are met, the government said. Just hours away from the first set of hostages being released from Gaza, US officials have a working list of 10 hostages that they believe are likely to be released on day one, a source familiar says. It was not clear whether any of the three American hostages – including 3-year-old Abigail Edan – would be released on the first day. The deal is structured in such a way that each day, a group of hostages to be released would be handed off to the Red Cross; the Red Cross would then take the group to a designated border point, which will largely depend on the location of those hostages, the source familiar said. Many of the first 50 hostages are expected to come out through Egypt, they said. The first two days of the hostage release will be treated as a “testing period,” the source said, to make sure the process is working. By day three, there is expected to be intense discussions about a potential second phase of the hostage release beyond the initial group of 50. The deal followed mounting pressure on the Israeli government from the families of the hostages, who have demanded answers and action from Netanyahu. It also comes amid growing international pressure for more humanitarian support for the people of Gaza. Even as the details of the release remained unclear, some family members of the hostages held by Hamas expressed relief – and anticipation as they waited to learn whether their loved ones would be included in the negotiated release. Anat Moshe Shoshany, whose grandmother was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz on the back of a moped, said hearing of the hostage deal gave her “so much hope.” “I really do hope to see someone walking out of there alive,” Shoshany said. “We want a chance to see our loved ones back. This is all we want and I really hope this is just the first step in this mess.” Liz Hirsh Naftali, the great-aunt of Abigail Edan, the 3-year-old US citizen being held hostage by Hamas, told CNN that the situation has been “excruciating.” “We have spent the last seven weeks, seven weeks, worrying, wondering, praying, hoping,” she said. The family hopes Abigail, who is the youngest American hostage held by Hamas, can come home by Friday, her fourth birthday. “We need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to believe it,” Naftali added. US President Joe Biden welcomed the deal in a statement Tuesday night in Washington, saying it “should bring home additional American hostages.” He pledge he “will not stop until they are all released.” Three Americans could be among the 50 women and children freed as part of the deal, senior US officials said. Ten Americans remain unaccounted for, including two women and a 3-year-old girl, according to a senior administration official. The official didn’t name the girl. A US official also said there are “various locations where the hostages will be brought out,” but declined to provide further detail. The IDF spokesperson Conricus said the list of hostages to be released in the deal are all Israelis - some with dual nationalities. He added that the Palestinian prisoners set to be released are “not serious offenders.” Israel on Wednesday released a list of 300 prisoners that could be released, leaving open the possibility of a second phase of exchanges of prisoners for hostages after the initial four-day period. The vast majority of the Palestinian prisoners listed as eligible for release in an exchange for Israeli hostages are male teenagers aged 16 to 18 – children under the United Nations definition – although a handful are as young as 14. Some 33 are women, according to a CNN count. The list of names published by Israel also lists the charges under which the prisoners are being held. Throwing stones and “harming regional security” are among the most common, but others include support for illegal terror organizations, illegal weapons charges, incitement, and at least two accusations of attempted murder. The publication of the list starts a 24-hour period during which legal petitions against the release of Palestinian prisoners can be filed to Israel’s Supreme Court, after which point the process is expected to begin. The total number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails is approximately 8,300, according to Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, a non-governmental organization. Of those 8,300, more than 3,000 are being held in what Israel calls “administrative detention,” which Amnesty International says can be extended indefinitely. The arrangement for a second phase of exchange built into the deal has the potential to create a longer humanitarian pause than just the four days originally stipulated, officials and statements from the US, Israel and Qatar have suggested. “The hostages deal, as it is structured, includes a pause, a humanitarian pause over a number of days, four to five days at least. And there’s the potential with additional releases for that to be for that to be extended, but that will also be dependent upon Hamas releasing additional hostages,” according to a senior US official, who added this “incentivizes the release” of all hostages. The pause will also allow for additional, much-needed humanitarian convoys and relief aid to enter the enclave. Those would include fuel “designated for humanitarian needs,” according to Qatar, which did not provide further details on the volume of aid expected. In its statement Wednesday, Hamas said the deal “involves the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying aid relief, medical supplies and fuel to all parts of Gaza.” Israel has been highly reluctant to allow fuel into Gaza since October 7, citing concerns Hamas will use it to power its operations, and only last week agreed to allow minimal deliveries to power sewage facilities and water supply systems. Humanitarian groups have for weeks called for fuel to be allowed into Gaza, arguing it is critical for cooking food and maintaining operations at hospitals, which have struggled to keep patients, including neonatal babies alive, amid power outages, supply shortages and bombardment. Governments across the world and international organizations have also been ramping up pressure for increased aid deliveries to the struggling enclave.",World
Dutch vote in tight election with far right set for gains," Dutch voters cast their ballots on Wednesday in a nail-biting election in which opinion polls show at least three parties - including the far right -could hope for the top spot. A weighted poll published on the eve of the vote showed anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party (PVV) tied for the lead with the conservative People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte. ”I hope I don’t wake up tomorrow and we have Wilders as a prime minister. That’s a nightmare,” said Amsterdam resident Arie van der Neut, an architect, after he cast his ballot for the pro-European, center-left Volt party. Only one thing is certain: the Netherlands will get its first new prime minister in over a decade, after Rutte resigned in July as his fourth coalition government collapsed, ending a 13-year tenure. No party is on track to take more than 20% of the vote and with late polls showing Labour leader Frans Timmermans and Wilders making gains, and a large number of Dutch still undecided ahead of the vote, many scenarios are possible. Although it is the tradition, there is also no guarantee that the party that wins the most seats would end up delivering the prime minister, in a country where the vote is split among many parties and coalition talks can take months. Restricting immigration - the issue that triggered the collapse of Rutte’s last cabinet - has been a key issue in the campaign, alongside climate change. ”It’s been enough now. The Netherlands can’t take it anymore. We have to think about our own people first now. Borders closed. Zero asylum seekers,” Wilders said in a television debate late on Tuesday. Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgoz, a Turkish immigrant tough on immigration and Rutte’s successor at the helm of the VVD, who is hoping to become the country’s first woman prime minister, responded:”I don’t think anyone believes Wilders would be a prime minister for all. He’s all about closing borders, excluding groups who he feels don’t belong in the Netherlands.” Lawmaker Pieter Omtzigt, a centrist who founded his own party after breaking with the Christian Democrats, is trailing slightly behind the first three in the latest polls, but will still likely play an important role. At stake in the election is also whether voters in one of Europe’s most prosperous countries are willing to continue funding climate policies, such as an expensive rollout of offshore wind farms amid a cost-of-living shock across the continent. With the Netherlands a founding member of the EU, and Rutte a key operator in EU summits, fellow leaders will also be scrutinising the outcome as parties on the right have suggested seeking exemptions from the bloc’s rules on agriculture and immigration. Voting booths will close at 9 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), when national broadcaster NOS publishes its first exit poll. A first-place finish for Wilders could lead the Netherlands to a hard-right coalition with a strong anti-immigration line, even though he has been seeking to soften his image in the hope of entering government. A hard-right coalition could also soften plans to reduce livestock and fertilizer use, which are strongly opposed by farmers. If Timmermans is better placed, this could swing the next government toward the centre and more spending on climate policies and increase social spending, including raising the minimum wage. Rutte will remain in a caretaker role until a new government is installed, likely in the first half of 2024.",World
Deadly green mamba snake on the loose in Dutch city," A highly venomous snake is on the loose after escaping a home in Tilburg, the Netherlands on Monday afternoon, a municipality spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday. Local authorities are warning people to keep their distance and avoid approaching the poisonous green mamba, which is between 1.8 and 2 meters (6 to 6.5 feet) long. In the unlikely event someone is bitten by the snake, they should immediately call the emergency services, the spokesperson said. The tropical snake has a fondness for warm, dark spaces, the spokesperson added, saying it is unlikely the runaway mamba has slithered out of its owner’s house to face the cold Dutch winter. There are three species of green mamba, all native to Africa – one is found in the east and south of the continent, another in the west and another in the center. The municipality spokesperson did not specify which species the missing snake belonged to. Normally found in trees, this timid snake produces a fast-acting venom that can kill within days, though it is rarely attacks humans, instead preying on birds, small mammals and lizards.",World
Who are the Palestinian prisoners on Israel’s list for potential release?," Nearly seven weeks into the war, Israel and Hamas have agreed on a deal that would see the return of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for the release of at least 50 women and children held in Gaza, during a four-day pause in fighting. The Palestinian prisoners concerned are women and children, Hamas said Wednesday, adding that the agreement also involves the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying aid relief, medical supplies and fuel to all parts of the besieged territory. The Israeli government on Wednesday published a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners for possible release, as Israel is offering a potential second phase of exchanges. The list includes the ages of the prisoners, and the charges on which they are being held – throwing stones and “harming regional security” are among the most common. Others are listed as detained for supporting illegal terror organizations, illegal weapons charges, incitement, and at least two accusations of attempted murder. Some of the people are listed as being members of Hamas and other Islamic militant groups, but many of the prisoners are not listed as belonging to any organization. Most of the Palestinian prisoners listed as eligible for release are male teenagers aged 16 to 18 – children under the United Nations definition – although a handful are as young as 14. Some 33 are women, according to a CNN count. Around 8,300 Palestinian prisoners are currently held in Israeli jails, said Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Prisoners’ Affairs. More than 3,000 of them are being held in what Israel calls “administrative detention,” Fares told CNN, adding that this means they are being held without knowing the charges against them, and without an ongoing legal process. Most of the prisoners are men, Fares said, adding that there are also about 85 women and 350 children in detention. Israel has stepped up its arrests since Hamas’ attacks on October 7. Up to 2,070 arrests were documented in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem in that month alone, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society, a non-governmental organization dedicated to addressing the concerns of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. That figure includes 145 children and 55 women. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh claimed to Reuters last week that Israel had been ramping up arrests ahead of a hostage deal. “Israel is preparing for an exchange of prisoners, and they are arresting as many people as they can simply because they are preparing for such a deal,” Shtayyeh said. Wednesday’s diplomatic breakthrough offers a glimmer of hope for the families of Palestinian prisoners, as well as those of Israeli hostages. Hamas is holding 236 hostages in Gaza, including foreign nationals from 26 countries, according to the latest figures from the Israeli military. The abductions took place on October 7, when Hamas militants launched their brutal attack on Israel, killing at least 1,200 people. Four hostages have been freed so far – two American women and two Israeli women. An Israeli soldier who was abducted by Hamas was rescued by Israeli forces, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. While the first phase of the deal will include the release of 150 prisoners in four stages over four days, the Israeli Cabinet Secretariat said, more Palestinians could potentially be released from the list of 300 detainees, in exchange for at least 10 Israeli abductees being handed over to Israeli security forces each day. Israel said there would be a lull in the fighting during those four days under the deal. This is a developing story and will be updated.",World
What do we know about the Israel-Hamas hostage deal?," Israel and Hamas reached an agreement early Wednesday for a pause in fighting, alongside the release of some of the hostages held by the militant group, in return for Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The breakthrough deal comes after weeks of painstaking discussions involving international negotiators and mediators – and marks the first major de-escalation in the conflict, which began on October 7 after Hamas’ brutal attacks on Israel killed around 1,200 people. Since then, more than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began airstrikes on the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. Here’s what we know so far. The deal will see the release of 50 women and children held captive in Gaza by Hamas, according to Qatar, which mediated negotiations between Israel and the militant group. In return, Israel will grant a “humanitarian pause” in its assault of the enclave and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas released a statement saying 150 women and children held in Israeli prisons would be freed. The deal also allows hundreds of trucks carrying aid relief, medical supplies and fuel to enter Gaza, it said, echoing details in Qatar’s statement. Israel’s own statement said the pause in fighting would last four days – but said the truce could potentially be longer, with an extra day added for each 10 additional hostages available for release. The truce is slated to begin at 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) on Thursday, an Israeli official told CNN Wednesday. There is an option for the pause to last as long as 10 days, but Israeli officials believe it is unlikely to last that long. The names of the hostages to be released haven’t been publicized. However, Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said they are all Israelis, with some dual nationals. US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the deal “should bring home additional American hostages.” Two American hostages, Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie Raanan, were among four hostages released earlier in the conflict. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group that sprang up in response to the Hamas attack on Israel, lists 201 Israelis believed to be alive and held hostage in Gaza since October 7. That list includes 39 children aged 18 and under; 44 adult women and 89 adult men aged 19 to 64; and 29 people aged 65 and over. The youngest is Kfir Bibas, who is 10 months old; the oldest are Yafa Adar, Shlomo Mansour and Arye Zalmanovich, who are all 85. Hamas has said 150 Palestinian prisoners will also be freed from Israeli prisons. Most of the Palestinian prisoners listed as eligible for release in an exchange for Israeli hostages are male teenagers aged 16 to 18 – children under the United Nations definition – although a handful are as young as 14. Some 33 are women, according to a CNN count. The list of 300 names published by Israel also lists the charges under which the prisoners are being held. Throwing stones and “harming regional security” are among the most common, but others include support for illegal terror organizations, illegal weapons charges, incitement, and at least two accusations of attempted murder. The deal follows weeks of negotiations that involved the US and Egypt, with several starts and stops as fighting on the ground raged on, including Israel’s raid on the largest hospital in Gaza, sources told CNN. The deal hinged upon approval from Israel’s cabinet – which voted in favor of the agreement by a “significant majority” in the early hours of Wednesday morning, after what an Israeli official called a “tense and emotional” six-hour meeting. The deal also followed mounting pressure on the Israeli government from the families of the hostages, who have demanded answers and action from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Several parties and hostage families expressed their hopes that this initial deal could pave the way for the return of all hostages, with Israel’s president calling it a “significant first step.” Qatar’s lead negotiator has also urged the international community to “seize this brief window of opportunity to generate further momentum for the diplomatic track,” saying such a move was the only way to resolve the conflict and establish lasting peace. However, Israel made clear in its statement it plans to resume its air and ground campaign on Gaza “to complete the eradication of Hamas” once this round of hostage releases concludes. Netanyahu has repeatedly said there are two goals to the war: the return of all hostages, and the destruction of Hamas. On Tuesday before the deal was approved, Netanyahu told his cabinet the agreement would “allow (the military) to prepare for the continuation of the fighting.” He said the war would continue until “Hamas, Gaza will no longer be a threat to Israel.” This is a developing story and will be updated.",World
Families of Israeli hostages face an ‘excruciating’ wait for news after Israel and Hamas strike deal," After enduring nearly seven weeks of uncertainty about the fate of family members kidnapped by Hamas, relatives of hostages were left with hope and a new set of anxieties after Israel and the militant group reached a breakthrough deal on Tuesday that will see a four-day humanitarian pause to allow the release of at least 50 Israeli women and children. While the exact names of the hostages to be released has yet to be publicized by the government, officials say some have dual nationality. The Israeli military says Hamas is holding 239 hostages in Gaza, including foreign nationals from dozens of countries, who were taken during the October 7 attack. Protesting Wednesday outside Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Hadas Kalderon told CNN that until she sees her children with her own eyes, she will struggle to believe the deal is real - and that the military must be kept under pressure to strike a deal for all the hostages. Hamas militants stormed her kibbutz of Nir Oz on October 7, killing Kalderon’s mother and her niece while kidnapping her two children, Sahar and Erez, and their father Ofer. The 56-year-old says the last message she received from her son, who was staying in his father’s house that day, was: “Mum, be quiet, don’t move.” After hearing about Tuesday’s deal, Thomas Hand said he wanted “to jump through the roof with hope. But I also have to keep a level head emotionally… I can’t let myself get too far ahead.” It has been a period of anguish and hope for Hand, who was initially told his 8-year-old daughter Emily had died in the October 7 attack. Weeks later, Israeli officials told him that they’re not sure Emily was killed. They haven’t located her body and didn’t find any blood in the home where she was sleeping. She would have turned nine on November 17 while in captivity, the single parent, whose wife died of cancer, previously told CNN. While reasonably hopeful that Emily might be among those that will be released, he told CNN on Wednesday that he has heard nothing from the government about her whereabouts or condition. Nor has there been any proof of life, and he worries she might have been psychologically traumatized by what she has endured. Another family told CNN they face a “terrible week” ahead as they wait to learn whether their loved one will be among the hostages released. “My family, like all the other families, is going to go through a terrible week. We don’t know if my cousin is going to be amongst those released in this round,” Maya Roman, the cousin of a female hostage, told CNN. On October 7, Roman’s cousin, Yarden Roman-Gat, 36, handed her 3-year-old daughter to her husband hoping he could run faster as they tried to flee Hamas gunman. Her husband and child were able to escape, but Yarden has been missing ever since. “As it seems, we’re going to have to wait and see every day who are going to be released the following day and that’s going to be extremely hard,” Roman continued, adding it’s causing a lot of tensions among the different families. Among the dual nationals taken hostage is Abigail Edan a 3-year-old Israeli-American who was orphaned when her parents were killed by Hamas. Liz Hirsh Naftali, Edan’s great-aunt, told CNN about the “excruciating” wait to hear if her great-niece is coming home. “For our family we have spent the last seven weeks worrying, wondering, praying, hoping,” she said. “The one thing that we all hold on to is that hope now that Abigail comes home, she comes home by Friday,” she added. “Friday is her 4th birthday. We need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to believe it.” Some 1,200 people were killed in Israel during Hamas’ attack. Israel’s ensuing war with the group in Gaza has killed more than 12,000 Palestinians, including an estimated 5,000 children, according to the Hamas-run government’s press office. Under the terms of the deal, which was approved by Israel’s cabinet overnight, Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners, who are all women and children, according to Hamas. It will also allow the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying relief, medical and fuel to the devastated enclave, Gaza. Up to 83 Palestinian women and 380 children under the age of 18 are being held in Israeli prisons, more than half of whom have been detained since October, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society, a non-governmental organization. There are some 8,300 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, according to Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Prisoners’ Affairs, 3,000 of whom are held in what is known as administrative detention, meaning they are held without known charges against them or an ongoing legal process. There is potential for the truce to extend beyond the four-day period, where an extra day would be added to the truce for each 10 additional hostages available for release. On Wednesday, the Israeli government published a list with the names of 300 Palestinian prisoners as it offered the possibility of a second phase of exchanges of prisoners for hostages. Anat Moshe Shoshany, whose grandmother was kidnapped from Nir Oz on the back of a moped, said hearing that the Israeli cabinet had approved a deal for the release of some hostages held by Hamas gave her “so much hope.” “Even if my grandmother won’t be among those people, and obviously I hope she will be, but even if she’s not, I just can’t wait to see the picture of the children, of the innocent people going out from there after so many days, so many long days that we’re waiting for them,” she told CNN. As the war grinds into its 47th day Wednesday, families have learned to be patient, she said. “Because we can’t stand to fill all our hopes up and to (be) disappointed – but I really do hope to see someone walking out of there. I think it will fill us with hope for others.” The deal gives some breathing room for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who many in Israel blame for failing to anticipate the October 7 attack, and for the lack of progress in securing hostage releases. Roman said she was “proud” of her government, telling CNN: “I think this is a good deal.” “This is what we wanted for our loved ones, to start coming back, and you see that,” she said. “The one thing that’s important to us here is to get the hostages back. Me and my family kept faith all this time that our government really was putting the hostages at the top of the priority list.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Qadura Fares’ title.",World
A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects," In late September, Zimbabwe’s environment minister signed away control over a staggering amount of land — almost 20% of his country — to a little-known foreign company. Blue Carbon was a small, new outfit, not even a year old, but its chief was no fledgling entrepreneur: he was an Emirati royal whose family had ruled Dubai for 190 years, flush with oil money. The Dubai-based Blue Carbon has secured forested land nearly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom across five African nations to run projects to conserve forests that might otherwise be logged, preventing huge amounts of planet-heating carbon dioxide, or CO2, from entering the atmosphere. Blue Carbon can then use that conservation to create carbon credits to sell to companies and governments to “offset” the climate pollution they generate while they continue to burn planet-warming fossil fuels. The flurry of forest conservation deals with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Liberia and Tanzania were announced in the months ahead of the annual United Nations’ COP28 climate summit, being hosted this year in December by the United Arab Emirates. But according to several analysts and climate advocates CNN spoke with for this story, these conservation deals are the latest attempt by the petrostate to use green initiatives as a smokescreen for its plans to continue pumping fossil fuels. At the same time, the UAE has said it plans to extract its very last barrel of oil 50 years from now, when its reserves are projected to dry up — decades beyond when scientists say society needs to be done with fossil fuel. A spokesperson would not confirm to CNN that the company would sell those credits to the UAE, but given Blue Carbon’s chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, is a relative of Dubai’s royal ruler — who also serves as the UAE’s prime minister — the widely held assumption among analysts CNN spoke with is that these credits will be sold to the UAE to offset its enormous carbon footprint. They could also be sold to other oil-reliant nations and companies in the Gulf and beyond. CNN has reached out to the UAE government for comment. Blue Carbon would not confirm to CNN the area size of all its projects, how much money it has provided in financing or how many credits it hopes to generate. The agreements are in initial stages and not yet finalized. But the company did tell CNN it would present its deals at the COP28 summit in Dubai as a “blueprint” for carbon trading. The annual climate summit is where global leaders and negotiators from nearly 200 countries will convene to decide how and when to ramp down fossil fuel use. The UAE is expected to use its COP28 presidency to push hard to include carbon removal — not just from forests, but also from oil and gas as they burn and then storing it underground — central solution to the climate crisis. Climate advocates have criticized carbon removal — and scientists remain skeptical of its efficacy — as a ticket for companies to continue to produce and burn fossil fuels on a large scale, even expand, and profit handsomely. The UAE has a lot to lose, financially. Oil and gas account for around 30% of its GDP and 13% of its exports as of last year, according to the US Department of Commerce. More than 80 countries support phasing out fossil fuels, and renewable energy, like wind and solar, are now so cost competitive in most parts of the world that market forces will eventually squeeze oil and gas out anyway. Unless, that is, fossil fuel companies and lobbyists can convince the world at COP28 not to rely too much on wind and solar, and to keep pumping oil and gas. The UAE has already been hit with a barrage of criticism since it put Sultan Al Jaber — who runs the nation’s mammoth oil and gas company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and serves as the nation’s international climate envoy — in charge of the negotiations. More than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament in May called for Al Jaber to be replaced as COP28 president. Al Jaber sees no conflict of interest in his many roles, he has said in multiple interviews. Nor does ADNOC, which told CNN in an email that there was “no one more qualified,” to lead the negotiations, pointing to his experience as leader of the nation’s renewable energy vehicle, Masdar, as well as its fossil fuels oil and gas company. Al Jaber has long argued that fossil fuel companies need to be at the table in climate negotiations to ensure the green transition actually happens. There is a certain logic to the argument, but climate advocates aren’t buying it, pointing instead to all the time the fossil fuel industry has had to show leadership on the issue, but hasn’t. Some fossil fuel companies were among the first to understand their products were causing climate change. That was around four decades ago, yet they continued to profit from coal, oil and gas. “I think that ADNOC has turned the UN climate negotiations into a giant greenwashing operation for one of the largest oil companies on the planet,” said Jamie Henn, founder and executive director of the non-profit Fossil Free Media, which supports the movement to end fossil fuels. “It’s been clear from the start when the UAE applied to host this COP that one of the main goals of the meeting was for them to try and situate themselves, and their oil and gas industry by extension, as somehow part of the climate solution.” As of 2020, the UAE was responsible for around 0.53% of the world’s CO2 emissions, according to data from Climate Watch, but with a small population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the sixth-largest carbon polluter per capita. Despite its relatively small population, the UAE was the world’s seventh-biggest oil producer by volume in 2022. Henn said it was “absurd” that the negotiations had been taken over by fossil fuel interests. “It’s like the international tobacco control negotiations being run by Philip Morris. Luckily, the UN has rules in place for those negotiations, where they don’t let tobacco lobbyists at the table,” Henn said. “We need that at COP.” Never has a COP, which is hosted by a different city each year, had so many apparent conflicts of interest. Not only is Al Jaber wearing leadership hats for climate and fossil fuels, but Blue Carbon is so intertwined with the nation’s royals and rulers, it’s difficult to separate its promotion of carbon offsets from the UAE’s interest in continuing fossil fuel production. And it will be in Dubai, at COP28, where the rules of how to buy and sell these very carbon credits will be decided. When asked by CNN if Blue Carbon was looking at more carbon offset deals in Africa, a spokesperson for the company said that “with COP28 around the corner, we will formally announce a few more of our initiatives.” A source with knowledge of the COP28 agenda told CNN the company would use the deals to promote carbon credits as a bigger part of the climate solution. It’s not a big surprise that so many countries have signed up to work with Blue Carbon. Its parent company, Global Carbon Investments, has already agreed to transfer $1.5 billion to Zimbabwe in “pre-financing for carbon credits.” That’s more than the country spends on education and childcare, which combined are Zimbabwe’s biggest national expense. With so little money trickling in from the developed to the developing world to adapt to the climate crisis, carbon credit schemes open a new channel of revenue for forest-rich countries. Cutting down forests or letting them degrade accounts for at least 12% of global planet-warming emissions. It’s their ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that makes them valuable as a climate solution. Yet the idea of creating tradable carbon credits in exchange for not cutting down forests has been widely criticized as problematic. And some of the world’s biggest companies certifying carbon credits have been shown to use accounting methods that exaggerate their project’s true contribution to mitigating climate change. In early November, Swiss entrepreneur Renat Heuberger stepped down from his role as CEO of South Pole — one of the world’s first major carbon credit trading companies — after media reports found the company had overstated the climate value of carbon credits that lay in its Kariba forest project in Zimbabwe. South Pole has denied the media allegations, calling the reports “exaggerated” and “misleading.” “Investment in efforts to conserve forests is always welcome. However, the challenge is that conserving forests isn’t a ‘get out of jail free’ card,” said Julia Jones, a conservation scientist at Bangor University in Wales. “Globally, we need to both stop further loss of forests and drastically cut emissions,” she said. “Using one to offset the other, without very substantial investment in reducing emissions, is problematic.” Land rights are another issue. In some cases, indigenous and customary landowners have been evicted to clear the way for such projects, as they witness their homes, once deemed nearly valueless, transformed into cash cows for polluting companies and countries. The Forest Peoples Programme, a non-governmental organization, says that such evictions have become more common in Kenya since it began allocating land for carbon credits. “Those in control of Africa’s forests stand to earn a lot of money, and corporations appear to be pursuing a new ‘scramble for Africa,’” Justin Kenrick, a senior policy advisor at the Forest Peoples Programme, told CNN in an email. “Meanwhile such ‘conservation’ in Kenya persists with a failed colonial approach of evicting the very communities who know best how to conserve their forests.” Whatever the outcome at COP28, the UAE’s state-run oil and gas company, ADNOC, stands to emerge a big winner, especially if it can convince the world that its “Maximum Energy. Minimum Emissions” slogan is a viable climate solution, even as global temperatures soar and scientists press for rapid fossil fuel cuts. An ADNOC spokesperson did not directly answer CNN’s questions on how many people would represent the company at COP28, but dismissed suggestions the company would benefit from the conference as “incorrect” and “baseless.” ADNOC is expected to hike its oil production by 41% and its gas production by a third by 2030, compared to projections for this year, according to an analysis of industry data by Global Witness, a non-profit focused on environmental justice and human rights. That translates to a 40% rise in its greenhouse gas emissions, Global Witness said. The production boost contrasts with plans among other oil majors: Shell’s production is projected to remain largely flat in that time, while BP envisions a 25-percent production cut by 2030. ADNOC, by 2030, plans to out-produce both companies. ADNOC is starting to look like a new international oil major in other ways, too: It’s expanding its portfolio by buying up assets overseas, such as a gas fields in Azerbaijan, and it has teamed up with BP in a bid to buy a 50% stake in Israel’s NewMed Energy, with a focus on gas exploration in areas including the eastern Mediterranean. It is also buying into projects around renewables and chemicals, the company told CNN. To limit its carbon footprint amid the expansion, ADNOC said in October it plans to capture 10 million metric tons of CO2 a year from its operations by 2030 — a figure Global Witness found was wildly exaggerated in a recent analysis. ADNOC currently has the capacity for 800,000 metric tons per year, though it hopes to capture another roughly 3 megatons per year through two facilities not yet completed. Even if those facilities do come online, Global Witness calculates it would take ADNOC more than 340 years to capture the amount of planet-heating carbon it is expected to emit between 2023 and 2030, if it captured both the emissions from its operations and those that occur from using its oil and gas. ADNOC did not address the calculation in its response to CNN, saying only that it had set its ambition “to achieve net zero by 2045 backed by an initial $15 billion allocation.” “Before this year, most people would have been forgiven for never having heard of ADNOC. The more we learn about this company — whose CEO remember is charged with making meaningful progress on emissions reductions at COP28 — the greater an outlier it becomes,” Patrick Galey, a senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, told CNN. “ADNOC plans not only to produce billions of barrels of oil for decades to come, but it is also positioning itself to be among the most aggressive expanders of oil and gas production out there.” How much the UAE company expands beyond 2030 will depend on what role negotiators see for carbon capture at COP28, and whether it can find new markets abroad. Ironically, COP28 could be the arena that transforms ADNOC into a global oil major. This story has been updated with additional information.

This beer is made from recycled shower water," You wouldn’t know if you tasted it, but Epic OneWater Brew is a beer with a peculiar ingredient: it’s made with water recycled from the showers, sinks and washing machines of a residential building. The beer is safe to drink, thanks to a series of treatments that include microfiltration and ultraviolet light, and it is meant to bring attention to the issue of water scarcity and reuse. “Buildings globally use 14% of all potable water,” says Aaron Tartakovsky, CEO and co-founder of Epic Cleantec, the San Francisco-based water treatment company that made the beer in collaboration with a local brewery. “Almost no buildings reuse that water — that’s what we’re trying to change.” The beer is a Kölsch-style ale — a crisp, light-bodied drink originating from Germany — and was made with recycled graywater from Fifteen Fifty, a 40-story luxury apartment building in San Francisco. But it’s not for sale, as regulations prohibit the use of recycled wastewater in commercial beverages. At least for now. Epic Cleantec equips buildings with its water recycling system, eliminating the need to discharge wastewater into a sewer to transport it to a remote treatment facility. The system recycles up to 95% of wastewater, according to the company — either what is known as blackwater, which comes from toilets, or graywater, which comes from sinks, washing machines, bathtubs and showers. It does so by first using biological treatment to remove organic matter, then microfiltration via membranes just 0.04 microns thick (about 0.05% of the thickness of a human hair), and finally disinfection by ultraviolet light and chlorine, which makes the water safe for reuse in non-potable applications like toilet and urinal flushing, irrigation and laundry. The system installed in Fifteen Fifty is designed to recycle 7,500 gallons of water per day, or up to 2.75 million gallons per year. “What we’ve done is just take a lot of existing principles in the wastewater world and design it for single buildings instead,” Tartakovsky said. “We do for water what solar did for energy, which is moving away from a sole reliance on large, centralized infrastructure.” Epic Cleantec says the system has other benefits: recovered heat from the wastewater can be used to pre-heat domestic hot water, cutting heating costs, and the organic matter in the wastewater can be used to produce natural soil products, usable in landscaping, gardens or parks. An installation takes the space of a few parking spots, on average, but it’s expensive — from a few hundred thousand dollars into the millions, depending on the size of the building. However, Tartakovsky says that it pays for itself in just a few years, by lowering utility bills. In San Francisco, since 2015, all new buildings of more than 100,000 square feet are required to have an on-site water recycling system; out of the few dozen currently installed, Epic Cleantec is responsible for five. “It’s very common sense. Why are we still using pristine drinking water from our national parks to flush the toilets of our tech employees in downtown San Francisco?” Tartakovsky asks. “Scientifically, this water often meets or even exceeds drinking water standards.” Epic Cleantec started its beer project in late 2022, for attendees of a conference on sustainable building technologies. “We ended up producing just over 7,000 cans, not as a commercial product, but as an educational effort,” Tartakovsky says, using 2,000 gallons of recycled water. “It was meant to tell the water reuse story in a new way. But frankly, we did not anticipate the tremendous response that we saw.” While Epic Cleantec’s system isn’t intended to produce water for drinking, regulations currently allow potable reuse of wastewater in many US states, including California and Texas. More states, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Washington, are in the process of updating their water reuse regulations. “Recycled water is already being used as a source of drinking water in places like Southern California, Singapore and Australia,” says David Sedlak, director of the Berkeley Water Center at the University of California, Berkeley. “All of those operations rely upon recycling plants that are associated with sewage treatment plants. Building-scale water recycling systems offer an opportunity for cities to reduce their reliance on water from rivers, lakes and reservoirs — sources that are vulnerable to climate change. It also offers opportunities to save energy and reduce the amount of pollutants that cities release to the environment.” Sedlak, who is not involved in Epic Cleantec, says the water recycling system developed by the company has proven its technology to be a viable means of recycling water within buildings. “It is clean enough to use to produce a tasty beer and it is certainly clean enough to use for toilet flushing and landscape irrigation,” he adds. In 2017, two California-based brewers produced limited-edition beers made from recycled water, to serve at local events. Daniel McCurry, an assistant professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Southern California, tried one. “I drank it with no reservations, but it was brewed with water from a municipal potable reuse project in San Diego,” he says. He explains that municipal systems for potable reuse typically include two more steps than Epic Cleantec’s – reverse-osmosis and UV/advanced oxidation processes – which McCurry says can remove chemical contaminants such as industrial solvents and pharmaceuticals “to a much greater extent than by ultrafiltration, UV, and chlorine alone.” Being able to sell beer or other drinks made with such water would require another regulatory step, but it isn’t out of the question, according to Tartakovsky. “When I got into the water industry, there was a lot of often-repeated tropes that the general public was just not ready for recycled water,” he says. “In the industry, we call it the ‘yuck’ factor. There’s a mental perception that recycled water is not as clean as other sources of water. But what I often remind people of is that all water on this planet is recycled. The water we are drinking today is the same water that was consumed by the dinosaurs millions of years ago.” He adds that, despite not being its focus, Epic Cleantec is now having conversations with some of the largest brewers in the world. “We have a lot of people who are asking for more of it, just because beyond being an interesting environmental story, the beer actually just tastes really good,” he says. “You’re going to start hearing a lot more about a lot of different industries using recycled water for their products. I think the sky’s the limit for what we can do.”",World
Indian rescuers dig past halfway mark in efforts to reach trapped workers," Rescuers in India drilled past the halfway mark on Wednesday in efforts to reach workers trapped in a partially collapsed tunnel in the Himalayas. Forty-one labourers became trapped in India’s northern Uttarakhand state after part of the passageway to the tunnel’s entrance gave way on November 12, sparking a frantic rescue mission. The operation has been able to use heavy machinery to successfully drill through two-thirds of the way through the rubble to reach the workers that have been trapped for more than a week, according to authorities on Wednesday. A total of 39 meters’ drilling has been done with an Auger machine, according to a press release issued by state authorities, adding the drilling was “done at a fast pace.” There is believed to be a total distance of 60 meters worth of debris between the rescuers and those trapped, authorities said earlier. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, senior government official Dr. Neeraj Khairlanji said, “If there are no further hurdles, then maybe by later tonight or early morning we may have some good news.” The incident earlier this month left workers confined behind a pile of rubble with little oxygen and water. Authorities established contact with the men soon after the collapse and embarked on a mission to bring them out safely, aided by local police, India’s Disaster Management Authority and State Disaster Response Fund. In what was described as the operation’s “first success,” rescuers managed to insert a 53-meter (174 ft) pipe through the rubble late Monday, allowing them to deliver their first hot meal of lentils, water, medicines and oxygen to the trapped laborers. A second pipeline was put in place on Tuesday to deliver more food to the workers. The tunnel is part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Char Dham Highway project, a multimillion-dollar infrastructure plan to improve connectivity in the state of Uttarakhand and provide better access to important pilgrimage locations. Uttarakhand, a mountainous and picturesque state on India’s border with China, is often referred to as “Devbhumi” or “Land of the Gods” owing to its rich cultural heritage and the abundance of Hindu religious sites.",World
‘I felt that Africans could also be part of this’: Meet the Kenyan stargazer inspiring children to look to the sky," Susan Murabana’s life-changing moment happened at 22 years old, when she looked through a telescope for the very first time. Suddenly, Saturn and its yellow-gold rings were more than just an illustration in a textbook; they were real and the experience was powerful. The opportunity came while she was a student volunteering with Cosmos Education, a non-profit dedicated to improving science learning in developing countries. By traveling with the organization to schools and villages in her home country of Kenya and helping teach young children, her love for astronomy was sparked. “I thought I was going to inspire them [the children],” she said. “Instead, I was inspired too.” In 2006, Murabana joined a teacher training program called Global Hands-On Universe, where she led a space education project. Four years later, she completed an online Master’s degree in astronomy from James Cook University in Australia, before being invited to the University of California as a short-term scholar. Here, she realized she wanted children in Africa to be as exposed to opportunities as children in the US were. “Seeing the access to all these opportunities for kids — planetariums, science centers, festivals and everything else — I wanted to bring back that,” she said. “I wanted to have something sustainable and Kenyan that the Kenyan community would like.” In 2014, Murabana and her husband Daniel Chu Owen set up the social enterprise Travelling Telescope. Combining Susan’s experience in education and public outreach with Owen’s passion for astrophotography and his knowledge of telescopes, the Travelling Telescope is an educational program designed for young children in underserved and remote communities. With just a telescope and a mobile inflatable planetarium, they aim to change lives by giving children a chance to see Saturn, the moon, and various constellations, whilst teaching them basic science and astrophysics. “There’s a satisfaction you get from going to a school, talking to the children, and seeing their reaction and their anticipation,” said Murabana. “A 12-year-old boy in eastern Kenya even told us, ‘I used to think scientists lie, but now I believe in science.’” Murabana and Owen would love to inspire more Kenyans to be involved in the space industry, and dream of seeing the first Kenyan in space. Owen says most Kenyans aren’t aware that the country is involved in space research, but in 2018 the Kenya Space Agency deployed its first satellite into orbit from the International Space Station, and a satellite station in Malindi, on the coast of southeastern Kenya, is used by the European Space Agency for satellite tracking. Murabana believes astronomy, or even simply the act of looking up at the sky, establishes an awareness of the need to protect our planet, which can create “a generation of more informed leaders.” “They say the first environmentalists were astronauts,” said Owen, “because they were the first ones to see the planet in its entirety. We are bringing that home in a way — looking out at space helps us look at our own planet much more objectively.” But there is also a more personal motivation for Murabana’s work — combatting the perception that astronomy is a Western science. When she was volunteering with Cosmos Education, the team had graduate students from the UK and US but no one else from Africa. Despite Murabana’s passion for astronomy, she felt she didn’t belong. It wasn’t until a few years later, when she attended a solar eclipse viewing and a related conference in Ghana themed “African Cultural Astronomy,” that her perceptions changed. The history of astronomy in Africa can be traced back for millennia, and includes the ancient Egyptians and the Dogon people of Mali. “Everything I was having access to in terms of astronomy was Western, like the moon landings, and we still don’t have astronomy textbooks that have come from the African culture,” she explained. “So going to this conference and learning about how traditionally, different African cultures have looked up to the sky and tried to make sense of it was just empowering. I felt like I belonged, and that Africans could also be a part of this.” Murabana and Owen fund Travelling Telescope by running astro-tourism services, which include camping trips, called Star Safaris, and astronomy nights for paying tourists. They are in the process of buying a piece of land in Kenya, away from light pollution, on which they’re hoping to create what they call a “cosmic hill.” “I would like to build an observatory there,” explained Owen, “and invite people to come and learn about space and watch special events like meteor showers. I want to have a little base, somewhere for us to sit and enjoy the sky with whoever wants to share it.” So far, over 400,000 people have looked through the Travelling Telescope and the pair want to amplify their impact by reaching more schools. For Murabana, the dream is that “every child, at least once in their lifetime, gets the chance to have a lesson under the night sky.”",World
North Korea claims to have put spy satellite into orbit. Analysts say that could make its military stronger," North Korea on Wednesday said it had put its first spy satellite into orbit and vowed further launches to defend against what it called its “enemies’ dangerous military maneuvers.” Analysts said if the spacecraft works, it could provide significantly improve North Korea’s military capabilities, including enabling it to more accurately target opponents’ forces. The satellite, named “Malligyong-1,” was launched late Tuesday on a new carrier rocket, “Chollima-1,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). “The launch of a reconnaissance satellite is the legal right of North Korea to strengthen its right to self-defense,” the KCNA report said. Neither South Korea, the United States nor Japan, all of which are experiencing increasing military tensions with North Korea, could confirm the satellite had made it into orbit. But South Korea called the launch a “clear violation” of a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits North Korea from using ballistic missile technology. And Wednesday morning the South Korean government partially suspended an agreement it had with North Korea that limited the South’s reconnaissance and surveillance activities along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two countries. The rocket carrying the satellite was launched in a southerly direction and is believed to have passed over Japan’s Okinawa prefecture. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch, referring to it as “a serious situation” that “affects the safety” of people in Japan while reiterating his commitment to continue working with the US and South Korea to respond to Pyongyang’s launches. In a statement Wednesday, Seoul’s military said that it had been tracking preparations for the launch in close cooperation with the US. The statement said Aegis destroyers from South Korea, the US, and Japan were deployed to track the launch and information about the specifics of it were being comprehensively analyzed. Japanese Defense Minister Hiroyuki Miyazawa said his country was still trying to determine whether North Korea’s satellite had reached orbit. Pyongyang first attempted to put a satellite into orbit in late May, but the second stage of the rocket carrying the satellite malfunctioned and it crashed into the sea. KCNA said “the reliability and stability of the new engine system” was “low” and the fuel used “unstable,” leading to the mission’s failure. A second attempt failed in August when there was “an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight,” a KCNA report said at the time. That rocket broke into multiple parts before falling into the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese officials. In a defiant speech to the UN Security Council after the second failed launch, North Korean Ambassador Kim Song insisted that pursuing the spy satellite program was within the country’s “legitimate right as a sovereign state.” He denied that North Korea had been seeking to acquire intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology through the satellite launch. Tuesday night’s third attempt was widely expected and signaled by Pyongyang, which early Wednesday vowed to launch more. North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration would submit a plan to “secure the capability to reconnoiter the south Korean region … by additionally launching several reconnaissance satellites in a short span of time,” KCNA said. Pyongyang said having a satellite was a legitimate self-defense measure against what it claims are a series of provocations by the US, South Korea and Japan. Earlier this week North Korea denounced the US for its potential sales of advanced missiles to Japan and military equipment to South Korea, calling it “a dangerous act” in a report from KCNA. North Korea said it was “obvious” who the offensive military equipment would be aimed at and used against. Analysts said even a single satellite in orbit helps North Korea’s military posture. “If it works it will improve the North Korean military’s command, control, and communications or intelligence and surveillance capabilities. That would improve the North’s ability to command its forces” in any possible conflict, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. The “satellite will give them a capability that they previously used to lack that can assist them in military targeting, it can assist them in damage assessment,” said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And lessons learned from Tuesday’s launch will be used in developing future satellites, Panda said. “They’re going to take what they learn with this successful launch and apply it to additional launches. They will look to have a resilient, redundant constellation of Earth observation satellites and that will make a pretty big difference for (North Korea’s) overall strategic situational awareness capabilities,” he said. But others cautioned that the real capabilities of what Pyongyang launched late Tuesday remain to be seen. Some suggested the North had more to lose from the South’s resumption of intelligence gathering along the border than it had to gain from the satellite launch. “The surveillance drone operations Seoul may soon commence along the DMZ should produce more useful intelligence than North Korea’s rudimentary satellite program,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. South Korea’s Defense Minister Shin Won-sik last Sunday said that the North was believed to have “almost resolved” its rocket engine issues “with Russia’s help.” That came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had visited Russia in September, when he toured the Russian space rocket launch site alongside President Vladimir Putin. In that meeting, Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite program. But Panda cautioned about making assumptions that aid and advice from Russia had made the difference for a successful third launch. “It would seem unlikely to me given the timeline here that the North Koreans have already received and implemented technical assistance from Russia,” he said. “Let’s also bear in mind that the North Koreans themselves are remarkably capable at this point.”",World
Israel considers potential hostage deal with Hamas," Israel’s cabinet convened to consider a proposed hostage deal on Tuesday, in a meeting that stretched into the early hours of Wednesday local time, following meetings of the country’s war cabinet and security cabinet. According to sources familiar with the negotiations, a draft of the proposed deal between Israel, Hamas and the US included the release 50 women and children hostages taken during the October 7 terror attack on Israel, in exchange for a four-to-five day pause in fighting and three Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons for every hostage released. The Palestinian prisoners are also expected to be women and adolescents. “We are making progress. I don’t think it’s worth saying more, even at this moment, but I hope there will be good news soon,” Netanyahu said as he met with reservists on Tuesday. US officials close to the negotiations have stressed that while the deal is not done, they are increasingly optimistic and believe the many weeks of difficult work is about to pay off with a hostage release. The hostages to be released are of various nationalities, one source told CNN, adding that the Americans are hoping one of them will be 3-year-old toddler Abigail Edan – the youngest American hostage – whose parents were killed by Hamas. It was not immediately clear how many more – if any – American citizens would be among the 50 hostages that Hamas would initially release under the deal. The hostages that Hamas offered for initial release are alive, the group says, according to a source familiar with the talks. The Israeli government aims for at least 50 hostages to be released as part of the deal being mooted Tuesday – 10 per day for five days – an Israeli government source told CNN. The government would be prepared to extend the deal if Hamas is prepared to release more hostages. Hamas had initially demanded that Israel’s overhead surveillance be stopped for the duration of the multi-day pause in fighting, sources told CNN. During the course of the negotiations, the parties settled on surveillance drones vacating Gaza’s airspace for part of each day. That six-hour window is when Hamas would be expected to try to move the hostages out without giving up their locations. Under the forthcoming agreement, Hamas would also gather up any additional women and children hostages during the period that fighting has paused – something the group has insisted that it cannot do until a sustained ceasefire is in place. The temporary ceasefire would potentially be extended beyond that for more hostages to be released. But Netanyahu has also made it clear that the war would continue after the end of the pause. Speaking before the cabinet meeting Tuesday, Netanyahu said the decision to approve the deal is “a difficult decision but it is the correct decision.” He said that Israel’s security agencies support the proposed deal. “They have made it clear that not only will the war effort not be harmed, it will enable the IDF to prepare for the continuation of the fighting,” he said. Israeli intelligence efforts and the security of IDF troops will be maintained, he also said. Hamas has demanded hundreds of trucks of aid, much of it fuel, as part of the negotiations. Fuel is key to running its military operations and ventilating the group’s network of underground tunnels in Gaza. A source familiar with the negotiations said there is hope that with a hostage deal significantly more aid will be allowed into Gaza, with stakeholders working toward a goal of 400 trucks a day. The deal would come after weeks of painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas and the US, with Qatar playing a major mediating role. Qatar delivered a draft of the hostage deal to the Israelis early Tuesday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Majid Al-Ansari told CNN. The implementation of the agreement would not begin immediately and could take at least a day to start, the person familiar said, in part because there are legal procedures that Israel must follow before releasing any Palestinian prisoners. The release of the prisoners needs to be approved by the Israeli government but that isn’t expected to be an obstacle, one source said. As cabinet officials met inside the Israeli Defense building to discuss the deal late Tuesday, families of the hostages gathered outside with banners and drums. But two far-right Israeli parties, which are members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government, did later suggest that they would not support the hostage deal being considered by the government. The Religious Zionism party, headed by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, said: “The suggested deal is bad and we must not agree to it. It’s bad for Israel’s security, for the hostages and for IDF soldiers,” adding, “The only way to return all the hostages is to continue applying military pressure on Hamas until its complete surrender.” National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power party also said it would “find it very difficult to support the deal.” Both parties’ statement suggested they had not yet seen the full terms of the deal. Diplomatic sources and government officials, including US President Joe Biden, over the last few days have struck a more optimistic tone about the progress of talks. But the various parties involved had also stressed that any agreement could be derailed by Hamas and developments on the ground in Gaza. On Monday night, Hamas’ leader said in a statement that the sides are “close to reaching a truce agreement.” The latest momentum comes just one day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet met with hostage families. Israel has said there are more than 200 hostages believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza. After the women and children are released, further negotiations to secure the release of other categories of hostages are likely to commence. Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross are expected to be involved in the release process, including potentially verifying the identity of the hostages in Gaza and of the prisoners in Israel that are part of the exchange, and transferring them across borders. The Swiss organization has previously served as an intermediary in hostage exchanges, including in the release of two pairs of hostages by Hamas last month. Gershon Baskin, a well-known Israeli peace activist involved in the 2011 release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas custody, said the hostages in Gaza are likely to be moved in Red Cross vehicles to Egypt, where they would be met by Egyptian intelligence. From there they would likely be driven to Israel in ambulances or buses, Gaskin said. Once in Israel, the hostages will “most likely be provided immediate medical attention,” according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby. “We have to assume that many of them need some sort of medical attention and that they’re being held in abhorrent conditions,” Kirby said. The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, met on Monday in Qatar with the political leader of Hamas, according to the aid organization. The ICRC does not take part in negotiations but stands “ready to facilitate any future release that the parties to the conflict agree to,” the organization said. Senior US officials have been working intensively to secure the release of hostages for several weeks, with the understanding that a handful of American hostages were taken hostage by Hamas. Biden has spoken directly with Netanyahu, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about the issue. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday that Biden has been “personally engaged in moving the process forward” and has been receiving updates from the US team involved in the negotiations “usually multiple times a day and jumping in as he felt appropriate to jump in personally.” Netanyahu said he had asked Biden to help improve the proposed deal and “indeed, it has been improved to include more hostages and at a lower cost.” Top Biden officials including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, NSC Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk and CIA Director Bill Burns have been engaged “almost hourly” on the efforts to get the hostages out of Gaza, sources said. McGurk most recently traveled to the Middle East for a multi-country trip aimed in large part at making progress on releasing the hostages.

Frustrations spill over in Israel as hostage families demand answers from Netanyahu," Tensions are boiling over in Israel as frustrated families of hostages demand answers from the government about the fate of their loved ones and a deal for their release. “I demand their commitment that everyone is returning home. All the hostages. We must get answers, and a commitment … in a written form,” said Shai Wenkert, who son Omer is being held hostage in Gaza by the militant group Hamas. Wenkert spoke to media on Monday, before he and other relatives met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet in Tel Aviv. So far only a handful of families have met with Netanyahu – infuriating hundreds of other relatives of hostages who say the government isn’t doing enough to free them. But for some, the meeting only deepened their frustration. Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Chaimi was taken captive, left the meeting early, saying he felt there was no new information on the hostages provided by the war cabinet, including details about a possible deal to release them. An estimated 239 hostages are being held in Gaza, abducted during Hamas’ bloody October 7 attacks on Israel that killed around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli military – the largest such attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948. Just a handful of hostages have been released so far. On October 20, two Americans – Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie Raanan – were freed on humanitarian grounds following negotiations between Qatar and Hamas. Soon after, two Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz, were also released. Lifshitz said she “went through hell,” describing being snatched from her home, driven off on a motorbike before being taken to a network of tunnels. Israel responded to the October 7 attacks by declaring war on Hamas and imposing a blockade of Gaza, plunging the strip into a dire humanitarian crisis. Around 12,700 Palestinians have died since the war began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, which draws its data from Hamas-run health authorities in the Strip. And while there is still overwhelming support in Israel for the war on Hamas, there is growing criticism of Netanyahu and his administration, who many blame for failing to anticipate the October 7 attack, and for the lack of progress in hostage releases. Earlier on Monday, public anger spilled over during a committee meeting in the Israeli parliament, with family members of hostages clashing with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and other far-right government figures. Ben-Gvir, a divisive figure in Israeli politics who wants Israel to annex the Palestinian territories, is promoting legislation that would see the death penalty handed down to terrorists. But many hostage families accuse Ben-Gvir of endangering their loved ones further, arguing that Hamas could be less willing to release hostages if there is suggestion that Israel might execute Palestinian prisoners. In the parliament meeting, family members held pictures of their loved ones and vented their frustrations aloud. “Bring them home!” chanted Gil Dickmann, whose cousin is being held in Gaza. “Maybe instead of talking about the dead, talk about the living. Stop talking about killing Arabs. Talk about saving Jews. This is your job!” shouted Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were taken on October 7. Almog Cohen, a colleague of Ben-Gvir in the Jewish Power party, fired back at family members. “You don’t have a monopoly on pain. We also buried more than 50 friends,” Cohen said. Ben-Gvir’s proposed legislation is making its way through parliament. It still has several stages to pass before becoming law and could yet be withdrawn. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement on Telegram that the group was “close to reaching a truce agreement” with Israel, following weeks of negotiations between the United States, Israel and Hamas, mediated by Gulf state Qatar. The statement came after Hamas had delivered a response to mediators in Qatar. “The movement delivered its response to the brothers in Qatar and the mediators, and we are close to reaching a truce agreement,” Haniyeh said. Haniyeh did not provide additional details about the potential agreement. In recent days, sources told CNN a possible deal to secure the release of some hostages and a temporary pause in fighting may be in sight. An agreement has yet to be struck, with several sticking points left to work through – though negotiators are expressing rare optimism, sources say. Netanyahu has repeatedly expressed two goals of the war – the release of all hostages, and the destruction of Hamas. Israel has rejected international calls for any ceasefire without the return of hostages.",World
"Exclusive: ‘Act now’ to keep US competitive in space race, senators say"," The top two lawmakers on the US Senate’s space and science subcommittee are pushing federal regulators to accelerate the approval of commercial space launches, arguing that the current pace could cost the United States its edge in the new space race. In a letter sent last week to the head of the Federal Aviation Administration’s commercial spaceflight office, Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Eric Schmitt implored FAA associate administrator Kelvin Coleman to “act now” to eliminate red tape and reduce delays in processing launch and return to Earth — or reentry — licenses. “As the pace of launches from U.S. commercial spaceflight companies increases and China’s state-backed space industry continues to grow, it is imperative that the processes at the FAA and other federal agencies adapt to keep pace with American innovation as well as adversarial threats in space,” the senators wrote in a letter dated November 14. The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is responsible for protecting public safety while simultaneously greenlighting a growing number of commercial space launches, which have quadrupled in just four years. The FAA has already licensed 104 launches this year, compared to 26 launches in 2019. “Keeping pace with industry demand is a priority and is important for several reasons, including meeting our national security and civil exploration needs,” an FAA spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Tuesday.  “We’re working diligently to attract, hire and retain additional staff.” In their letter, the senators named NASA’s commercial partners involved in the agency’s flagship human spaceflight program and urged Coleman to fast-track “high priority missions such as returning Americans to the moon.” Elon Musk’s SpaceX is responsible for developing the lunar lander — called Starship — that will ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo program. During a hearing last month before the Senate space and science subcommittee, a top SpaceX executive accused government regulators of stifling the company’s progress on Starship, a pivotal part of NASA’s Artemis program and the most powerful rocket ever built. “It’s a shame when our hardware is ready to fly, and we’re not able to go fly because of regulations or review,” said William Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president for build and reliability, noting that the company had been ready for more than a month to launch the next Starship test flight. “Licensing, including environmental (review), often takes longer than rocket development. This should never happen. And it’s only getting worse.” The remarks came as SpaceX was the subject of a lengthy environmental review by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a safety review by the FAA after the company’s first test flight of its massive moon rocket exploded about four minutes after lifting off in April. Regulators gave SpaceX the green light to proceed last week, and the company completed a partially successful second test flight on Saturday. In the letter dated the day before the FAA granted the launch license for Starship’s second test flight, Chairwoman Sinema, an independent from Arizona, and Senator Schmitt of Missouri, the top Republican on the subcommittee, told Coleman they were “troubled” by witnesses saying regulatory delays could enable China to continue to close the once-wide gap between itself and the US in space. Beijing is leading a parallel effort to NASA’s Artemis program by attempting to land Chinese astronauts on the same region of the moon and at roughly the same time. “It is no secret that the United States is in a space race with China — our chief economic and military adversary. We cannot be our own worst enemy when it comes to beating China to the moon and Mars,” Schmitt told CNN. The senators are now asking Coleman to respond to several questions, including what additional resources he may need to accelerate the launch licensing process, by November 28.",World
SpaceX’s explosive test flight achieved key milestones. But there is still a long way to go," Mere moments after SpaceX’s Starship system — the most powerful rocket ever built — was lost in a test flight Saturday, a somewhat complicated narrative around the vehicle began to emerge. The company immediately described the flight as a huge step in the right direction. “What we did today will provide invaluable data to continue rapidly developing Starship,” SpaceX said Saturday in a statement. “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.” Yet the loss of another Super Heavy rocket booster and Starship spacecraft highlights just how far they have left to go in the development process, even as significant progress is made. It also raises questions about whether SpaceX can meet some key deadlines on the horizon. Enabling humans to colonize the cosmos is the ultimate goal for this vehicle: SpaceX intends to use it to send people to the moon, Mars and beyond. Crucially, the Starship spacecraft is also the vehicle that NASA selected to land US astronauts on the moon for the first time in five decades as part of its Artemis program. The space agency is racing against China to get the job done, vying to become the first to develop a permanent lunar outpost and set the precedent for deep-space settlements. The first lunar mission that would make use of Starship — Artemis III — is slated for late 2025. In the aftermath of the first failed test flight in April, NASA officials expressed concern that the vehicle wouldn’t be ready in time. But federal officials reacted favorably to Saturday’s test launch. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson offered SpaceX his congratulations and noted “test is an opportunity to learn — then fly again.” And to be clear, Starship is still an essential part of NASA’s moon-landing plan. However, there are numerous daunting technological hurdles left to clear before those lunar ambitions becomes reality. Several key aspects of the second flight test went to plan: When the rocket took off from the SpaceX Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, just after 8 a.m. ET, it was able to ignite all 33 of its engines and continue firing them as the Super Heavy booster — which gives the initial burst of power at liftoff — burned through most of its fuel. The Starship spacecraft was then able to ignite its own engines and break away from the Super Heavy rocket booster to continue the mission. And the launchpad that served as the starting point managed to survive the sheer force of a rocket generating up to 16.7 million pounds of thrust (7,590 tonnes of force). None of those milestones were met during the vehicle’s inaugural integrated test flight in April. But other important steps originally slated for Saturday’s mission didn’t happen. The Super Heavy booster experienced a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” — or an unintentional explosion — shortly after Starship separated from it. The mishap prevented SpaceX from testing the maneuvers that will be necessary to land and reuse the launch vehicle. Similarly, the Starship capsule made it roughly 10 minutes into its flight, reaching an altitude considered to be beyond the edge of space — about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above Earth’s surface — but SpaceX was forced to terminate the mission when ground control lost its signal. The vehicle did not spend as much time in space as the company had hoped, collecting mere moments of flight data rather than the hour-and-a-half’s worth mapped out for the mission. John Insprucker, principal integration engineer at SpaceX, said during the livestream that the company had to trigger Starship’s self-destruct feature after contact with the vehicle was lost. That meant SpaceX wasn’t able to test out Starship’s landing technique either. “The hardest part about this — or the part that will take the longest — is solving for safe (Starship) reentry and landing,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk acknowledged in October during the International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijian. Being able to recover and rapidly reuse both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster are essential to SpaceX’s long-term goals. Such capabilities would make the rocket system affordable and nimble enough to rapidly conduct all the launches necessary to get the vehicle to the moon. In order to reach lunar orbit, Starship must be refueled while it’s parked near Earth. That’s because the massive spacecraft won’t have enough propellant left over to traverse the 238,900-mile (384,472-kilometer) void between our home planet and the moon after the initial launch process. As of now, SpaceX acknowledges it has to launch more than a dozen Starship tankers to refuel one spacecraft destined for the moon, said Wayne Hale — the chair of the NASA Advisory Council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee — in a Saturday interview. That’s because of the Starship’s immense size: Just getting the vehicle into space requires it to burn through the majority of its fuel. And while Starship can hold up to 3 million (1,500 metric tons) of propellant, the spacecraft itself is only capable of hauling up to 55,000 pounds (250 metric tons) of extra cargo to orbit, according to data published by SpaceX and the FAA. “So they’ve got to take that rocket that we saw demonstrated … and be able to fly 12, 15 more times for each lunar landing,” Hale told CNN. “That’s gonna be an impressive feat. They’ve got to learn how to do that … where it’s successful and reliable every time, and they’ve got to do that in a very short period of time.” With many milestones left to hit, it’s clear that even if the next Starship test flight is wholly successful, a moon landing will remain on the distant horizon. Musk previously acknowledged in 2020 that he hopes SpaceX will launch “hundreds of missions” with satellites before attempting a flight with crew. SpaceX also must build and test the versions of Starship that will serve as refueling tankers. A lander must be outfitted with life support equipment. And NASA will require Starship to make an uncrewed test landing on the moon before allowing its astronauts on board. Still, SpaceX emphasized that explosive failures can be integral to its development process, which embraces fiery mishaps in the early stages of designing a rocket in order to learn how to build a better rocket faster than if the company solely relied on ground tests. Though SpaceX’s failed test flights garner plenty of critics, it does not mean that the company is moving more slowly or costing more money than if NASA had attempted to develop a lunar lander itself. All told, NASA will pay SpaceX about $4 billion for two lunar landings. (The company has already invested more than $3 billion in developing its South Texas launch facility and the Starship Super Heavy launch system since 2014, according to an FAA court filing dated May 19.) For comparison, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft that NASA developed for the Artemis program have together cost more than $44 billion since 2006, according to data aggregated by the nonprofit Planetary Society. That rocket system had its first flight test last year. Under NASA’s current plans, SLS and Orion would transport astronauts from Earth to lunar orbit, while Starship would complete the final leg of the journey, ferrying them from the Orion spacecraft to the moon’s surface. But Hale noted that SpaceX doesn’t use the same development approach as NASA. The space agency spends years on careful design and rigorous ground testing — all but guaranteeing success on the first flight. In contrast, SpaceX wants to put early prototypes in the air, accepting that they may explode but will likely provide valuable information for future testing. “This is a different paradigm,” Hale said of Starship development. “The government — when you’re working with the taxpayers’ dollars — you really want to be careful and make sure you succeed. “Whereas (SpaceX) is a private company,” Hale added. “Yes, they’re doing this work in support of the government, but their methodology is quite different. And I think you could be successful either way. But, this way certainly has its exciting moments.” Starship can also be compared with Blue Moon, another lunar lander under development by the Jeff Bezos-owned space company Blue Origin. NASA selected Blue Moon as an alternative lunar lander for future Artemis missions. NASA expects to pay the company $3.4 billion for a single crewed lunar landing — the Artemis V mission currently slated for 2028 — with Blue Origin investing at least that much of its own money. Lakiesha Hawkins, the deputy to the deputy associate administrator for NASA’s moon to Mars program, said at its advisory council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee meeting last week that Blue Origin’s lunar lander won’t necessarily be simpler than SpaceX’s behemoth rocket and spacecraft system. “Both of those providers have their challenges,” Hawkins said, referring to SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lunar lander. “And they are equally — from my perspective — complex.” Blue Origin declined to comment on where Blue Moon stands in the development process. The companies are taking very different approaches in their moon landing strategies, but experts say both SpaceX and Blue Origin will be distinct from their predecessor in some key ways. Hale, the committee chair, said it can be difficult for members of the public to wrap their heads around why all of these projects are costing so much development time and money if NASA already knows how to put humans on the moon. Why not just repeat the same thing NASA did during the Apollo program? “People ask what was wrong with Apollo,” Hale said during the committee meeting last week. “The thing that was wrong with Apollo was it ended.” NASA and SpaceX are aiming to develop vehicles that don’t just go to the moon once. Apollo already accomplished the “flags and footprints” missions, Hale noted. Now, the space agency is looking to develop rockets and spacecraft that can push exploration further. NASA aims to establish a permanent moon base and eventually reach Mars in a cost-effective manner. “When you put those sustainable reusability requirements on the program — and the fact that it’s leading on to go to Mars — you do buy into perhaps a more complicated architecture than just repeating Apollo,” Hale said. And, even as he acknowledged Starship has a long way to go, he added, “I think they made a big step forward.” Musk has already said the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft will likely be ready for a third test flight in “3 to 4 weeks,” according to a Sunday post on social media, adding, “There are three ships in final production.” CNN noted that four Starship spacecraft and at least two Super Heavy boosters are visible from public roadways near SpaceX’s facility in South Texas. It’s not clear, however, how long it will take SpaceX engineers to review the data gathered during Saturday’s flight and implement the necessary changes. And Musk is known to publicize unmet deadlines. Also unclear is whether SpaceX will have the necessary regulatory approvals to launch another test flight in just a few weeks. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, indicated its intentions to open a standard mishap investigation into Saturday’s test flight. After the first test flight in April, a similar investigation took over four months to complete. Once the investigation is closed, the federal agency will then likely need to complete a safety review of SpaceX’s plans for a third launch before it will issue another permit. It’s not clear how long that process might take. The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.",World
"Iceland declares state of emergency, evacuates residents over threat of volcanic eruption"," Iceland has declared a state of emergency, with police officials urging residents to evacuate the coastal town of Grindavík following an intense wave of earthquakes in the southwest of the country linked to a possible volcanic eruption. Nearly 800 quakes were recorded between midnight and 2 p.m. on Friday, with the shallowest at a depth of 3-3.5 kilometers (1.86-2.18 miles), according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. In statements Friday, Iceland’s Civil Protection Agency said a magma tunnel that is forming could reach Grindavík. But as of Friday evening, the Icelandic authority said it has been impossible to tell if and where the magma might break through to the surface. “Earthquakes may become bigger than those that have already occurred, and this sequence of events could lead to an eruption. However, there are still no signs that the magma is nearing the surface. Its progress is being closely monitored,” the Civil Protection Agency said. Magma is a mixture of molten and semi-molten rock found beneath the surface of the Earth that can cause an eruption when it finds its way to the surface, becoming lava. Authorities urged residents to evacuate calmly and emphasized that there is no imminent danger. “We want to reiterate that residents MUST evacuate their homes and leave the town. But we also want to reiterate that this is not an emergency evacuation, there is plenty of time to prepare, secure things and drive out of town calmly,” the Civil Protection Agency said. “It is clear that we are dealing with events that we Icelanders have not experienced before, at least not since the eruption in Vestmannaeyjar. We faced that together, we will face this together and we will not lose heart,”  the Civil Protection Agency added. The US Embassy in Iceland issued a volcano alert, warning about the increased signs of volcanic activity. “If an eruption occurs, follow the instructions of Icelandic authorities. Volcanic hazards may include lava, toxic gases, and heavy smoke from fires ignited by lava,” it said. The world-famous Blue Lagoon thermal pool in the area has already closed due to the ongoing seismic activity. Since 2021, there has been an eruption almost every 12 months and the latest one took place in July south of Iceland’s capital Reykjavik. Iceland sits on a tectonic plate boundary that continually splits apart, pushing North America and Eurasia away from each other along the line of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is home to 32 active volcanoes.",World
"More than 180,000 demonstrators march in France against antisemitism"," Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across France on Sunday to call out a sharp rise in antisemitic acts since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. In Paris, an estimated 105,000 demonstrators joined the march, making it the largest mobilization against antisemitism since the protest against the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Carpentras in 1990, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Protesters were joined in the French capital by political figures including Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Together they held a banner with the words, “For the Republic, against antisemitism.” Demonstrators came out in smaller numbers in cities including Nice, Lyon and Marseille, according to BFM TV. More than 182,000 people took part in marches across the country, BFM TV reported, citing the interior ministry. Tensions have been rising in France, and particularly in the capital, over the Israel-Hamas war, resulting in a surge in antisemitic incidents, according to French President Emmanual Macron.   In a letter published in French newspaper Le Parisien on Saturday, Macron condemned “the unbearable resurgence of unbridled antisemitism.” He said more than 1,000 antisemitic acts were committed in France in one month alone – three times more than over the course of the entire previous year. Macron did not join the Sunday march but said in a social media post that “a France where our Jewish fellow citizens are afraid is not France.” “A France where French people are afraid because of their religion or their origin is not France,” he wrote. “No tolerance for the intolerable.” Later Sunday, Macron reiterated France’s solidarity with Israel, after he was criticized by prominent figures in Israel over comments he made in an earlier interview with the BBC. On Friday, Macron told the BBC that a ceasefire is “the only solution” to the situation in Gaza. “We share the pain and we do share a willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France. But I think there is no justification to attack civilians,” Macron said. In a phone call with Israeli President Issac Herzog Sunday, Macron said Israel has the right to defend itself “‘in compliance with international humanitarian law.” “The threat of terrorist groups in Gaza had to be eliminated,” Macron said, according to a statement from the Elysee Palace. “This fight must be conducted in compliance with international humanitarian law and taking into account the protection of civilian populations.” Macron’s calls for a ceasefire resonated as far as Australia, where Foreign Minister Penny Wong noted his comments and said, “We all want to take the next steps towards a ceasefire.” But she added that it cannot be one-sided, pointing out that Palestinian militant group Hamas, who attacked Israel on October 7, still holds Israeli hostages. The marches against antisemitism in France came as pro-Palestinian demonstrators also rallied in multiple European capitals over the weekend. Around 300,000 people in London turned out for a large pro-Palestinian rally on Saturday, according to police, marching through the streets of the British capital calling for a ceasefire. There was a heavy police presence in central London’s Hyde Park Corner as protesters chanted “free, free Palestine” and the more controversial refrain “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” Police said they had “faced aggression from counter-protesters” who stormed the area “in significant numbers” as the rally was building up. Officers intercepted a group of 150 people who were launching fireworks towards the end of the march, police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said in a statement issued later Saturday. Arrests were made after some of the fireworks struck officers in the face, the statement read. A pro-Palestinian demonstration also took place in Germany’s financial capital Frankfurt on Sunday, as well as in Barcelona and Brussels on Saturday.",World
Circus lion captured after hours on the loose near Rome," A lion that escaped from a circus in the Italian town of Ladispoli, near Rome, on Saturday has been recaptured after several hours on the loose, the local mayor has announced. Just after 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) on Saturday, Ladispoli mayor Alessandro Grando announced on his Facebook page that the lion had been caught. The animal had been on the loose for at least 5 hours, causing concern and confusion among local residents. “The lion has been sedated and captured. It will now be handed over by the circus staff. I thank the State Police, the Carabinieri, the Fire Department, the local and provincial police, the Asl [Local Health Authority], and all the volunteers who served during these hours of great apprehension,” Grando said on social media on Saturday evening. “I hope that this episode will stir some consciences, and that we can finally put an end to the exploitation of animals in circuses,” he added. Earlier on Saturday, Grando alerted local residents immediately after the animal’s escape, urging people to stay vigilant and advising them to stay at home. It was around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) when it was announced the lion had escaped from the circus and that the animal was immediately tracked down within the adjacent waterway. “Circus personnel are implementing the capture operations, with the support of Law Enforcement who promptly responded to the scene. Please exercise caution and avoid movement until further notice,” the mayor said. But the lion managed to disappear again in a very dense reedbed and reappeared in town. The lion ran away again after spotting the police car, Grando told Italian national broadcaster RAI. When asked how the animal managed to escape from the circus, the mayor said a member of the circus’ staff saw three people running away and that they found a broken lock at the circus. “They are talking about sabotage,” Grando said, adding that the incident will now be investigated. After escaping, the lion wandered around the streets of Ladispoli, a seaside town some 50km from Rome, and was filmed by many people from their homes or cars. Several videos on social media show the lion wandering around among parked cars and in front of the gates of houses. In order to catch the lion, veterinarians used a dart equipped with a geolocator, thanks to which the animal was eventually found and surrounded near a school, RAI reported. According to those at the scene, the lion was in good condition, although frightened and in a state of mild hypothermia, RAI also reported. The Carabinieri are investigating the incident. The Organization for the Protection of Animals (OIPA) said Saturday that this story “highlights the danger of circuses with animals from the point of view of public safety and, above all, the discomfort of poor creatures forced into captivity to be used for entertainment purposes,” adding that it hopes that a law banning circuses with animals will be introduced.",World
‘Be prepared for all outcomes’: Inside the saga of a supervolcano that’s waking up," Forget Italy’s most famous active volcano, Mt. Vesuvius, which destroyed Pompei in 79 AD. The most dangerous volcanic threat in Italy right now is one you’ve probably never heard of: Campi Flegrei, or the Phlegraean Fields. This unassuming plain, which stretches 200 kilometers (125 miles) under the bay of Naples and the islands of Capri and Ischia to the outskirts of the city of Naples, is a giant caldera, or depression, left by a supervolcano some 2 million years ago. It is now the site of multiple volcanoes that have been active for 39,000 years, many of which lie underwater. It’s also populated with villas, small villages and shopping malls and home to 800,000 people and a hospital under construction. More than 500,000 of the locals live in what Italy’s civil protection agency has deemed a “red zone,” an area encompassing 18 towns that’s at highest risk in the event of an eruption. An additional 3 million residents of Naples live immediately outside the eastern edge of the caldera, according to the civil protection agency. The last major eruption of Campi Flegrei was in 1538, and it created a new mountain in the bay. Seismic activity in the area has been intensifying since December of 2022, according to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), and experts fear that the volcano could be reawakening after generations at rest. The densely populated region, which is less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Vesuvius, is prone to a seismic phenomenon known as bradyseism, defined by cycles of uplift and gradual lowering of the ground. The last time the region saw such activity was 1984, when the ground rose 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) before it began a slow descent accompanied by seismic activity similar to what is happening in the area now. Currently in a state of positive bradyseism, when the ground moves upward, the entire volcanic zone is also experiencing a surge in earthquakes that has rattled nerves and sent residents seeking safety out into the streets. In September, the strongest earthquake in 40 years struck the region, and that 4.2 magnitude quake was followed by one of a similar strength just days later. So far in 2023 Campi Flegrei has recorded more than 3,450 earthquakes, 1,118 of which occurred in August alone. This is more than triple the previous year’s total, according to INGV’s data. More than 500 earthquakes occurred in October, the strongest of which hit 4.0 magnitude, followed by a dozen aftershocks. Until the beginning of May, the quakes were almost all under 3.0 magnitude, according to INGV. Many experts think the local population should be better prepared to cope with the seismic activity and the possibility of an eruption. On October 5, the country’s civil protection agency laid out an updated evacuation plan, which calls for the movement of half a million people over a 72-hour period of time on roads many locals fear won’t accommodate such intense traffic. The last time a such a plan had been studied was in 2019, and the findings showed the evacuation plan was lacking. Carlo Doglioni, head of the INGV, gave testimony on the potential outcomes of the seismic activity before the Italian government’s Environmental Commission’s lower chamber on September 28. “There are two possible scenarios relating to the evolution of the situation in the Campi Flegrei: the best is that the ongoing bradyseism crisis ends as happened in 1983 to 84; the worst is an eruption similar to that of 1538,” he said. “It is an evolution that we do not know and that we are monitoring,” Doglioni said. Dr. Giuseppe De Natale, a research director at the INGV in Naples, said the current cycle of uplift is associated with pressure below the surface of the caldera. “We don’t know exactly the depth of the increase of pressure, it could be between zero and 3.5 kilometers,” he said. There are two hypotheses as to what could be causing the current increase in seismic activity at Campi Flegrei, according to De Natale. The first — and potentially most dangerous — possibility is that it could be an “intrusion of magma coming from the magma chamber located about 8 kilometers deep,” De Natale said. The second, which he said is more likely, is that there is a large “degassing” of gases created by the magma coming from the deep magma chamber. The degassing at the same depth as the magma chamber is what he believes has caused the ground to rumble. “The problem is the rocks,” De Natale said. “The shallow rocks cannot hold high levels of pressure, so if the pressure increases too much, there could happen complete fracturing of the rocks, which is generally the cause of the eruption of a volcano.” Dr. Benedetto De Vivo, a retired professor of geochemistry at the University of Naples and an expert on bradyseism, agrees that the crater is degassing, and doesn’t think that the rising land is due to magma alone. These gases, he believes, are caused by the magma below the caldera receding, not rising. But he said it is impossible to know exactly what is happening. “We can use statistics to create models, but we cannot predict the natural process because we do not know all of the variables in play,” De Vivo said. In spite of objections by the local residents that drilling could trigger more seismic activity, De Natale won approval in 2009 to lead a team of volcano experts from 18 countries in 2012 on a mission to drill a pilot hole 501 meters (1,644 feet) deep into the caldera in an attempt to see exactly what was going on. However, Rosa Russo Iervolino, who was mayor of Naples at the time, halted the drilling project before it began, citing concerns for the population. In 2012, after she left office, the project was briefly reinstated by the new mayor, Luigi di Magistris, but by then funding had dried up and only the borehole was drilled. De Natale said there is no plan to resume drilling and the current city government told CNN that there are areas “of greater concern” from a budgetary standpoint when it comes to city projects, including developing better evacuation plans for both Mt. Vesuvius and the Campi Flegrei area. Supervolcanoes are among the most perplexing and least understood natural threats in the world. What distinguishes a supervolcano from an ordinary volcano is the amount of volcanic material it has ejected during past eruptions — a reflection of the volcano’s explosive power. A supervolcano is one that has ejected more than 240 cubic miles of material and reached a level 8 — the highest threat — on the Volcano Explosivity Index or VEI, according to the US Geological Survey. The VEI index measures how much debris is ejected, at what height, and for how long the eruption lasts. Yellowstone, which erupted 2.1 million years ago, was one of the largest ever known eruptions. The most recent eruptions of other notable supervolcanoes, including Long Valley in California, Toba in Indonesia, and Campi Flegrei, were all around the same size. Scientists have a 2,000-year record of activity on Campi Flegrei. Pillars at the Roman Temple of Serapis in the city of Pozzuoli in the middle of the caldera, which were excavated in the 18th century, show evidence of holes made by molluscs, revealing the pillars were once underwater. The base of the temple is connected to the sea by a series of underground tunnels, and the rising and falling of the ground caused by bradyseism has resulted in the water flooding and then draining out of the structure, making it possible to observe the seismic phenomenon over time. In 2016, the regional government designated the Campi Flegrei area  “yellow”  under its warning system, the second of four levels that move from green to red to indicate the danger to the population from the movement of the ground. Italy’s civil protection agency said in October it would be moving some parts of the area to next level, orange, given the intensity of the recent activity. The INGV now has to sign off on the level change, which it is expected to do since it originally petitioned the civil protection agency for the move. Upping the level to orange will allow civil protection agencies to evacuate the area most vulnerable to the effects of bradyseism and the continuing earthquakes more easily and keep the most vulnerable populations safe, officials say. During a meeting with the civil protection agency and government on November 7, the INGV also determined that 15,000 buildings, including 125 schools and other academic structures, are in the high-risk area. A directive will be released November 27 outlining a new protocol for evacuations, drills and potentially moving some institutions from the area temporarily until the current cycle of bradyseism subsides. Parts of the volcano could be weakening due to the effects of bradyseism, according to a paper published in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment in June. But the situation remains unpredictable, experts say. “What we expect depends on whether the ground keeps rising. If it carries on moving at its current rate, we expect the number of small earthquakes per day will fluctuate over weeks from just a handful to the swarms of a few hundred events, as felt in mid-August and late September,” said study coauthor Christopher Kilburn, a professor of volcanology at University College London. “Any larger magnitude earthquakes are most likely to occur during the swarms. These are the classic signals of crust being stretched to breaking point.” However, this does not mean an eruption is inevitable. “It’s the same for all volcanoes that have been quiet for generations,” said study coauthor Stefano Carlino, a volcanologist from the Vesuvius Observatory, in news release accompanying the paper. “Campi Flegrei may settle into a new routine of gently rising and subsiding, as seen at similar volcanoes around the world, or simply return to rest,” Carlino said. “We can’t yet say for sure what will happen. The important point is to be prepared for all outcomes.” A first step toward preparing should be avoiding population increase by prohibiting more construction in Campi Flegrei, which is one of the most developed areas in Italy, said Dr. Benedetto De Vivo, a retired professor of geochemistry at the University of Naples. He also said there should be a better evacuation route with wider roads so that people who live in the densely populated area could evacuate within 24 hours. “We cannot construct even one more home in the area,” he said. Italy’s volcano experts are wary about making specific predictions about volcanic eruptions for fear of being held accountable if they are wrong, according to the INGV. Seven scientists were convicted of manslaughter for telling residents of L’Aquila in central Italy not to worry about an increase in seismic activity in 2009. An earthquake that struck a few days after one scientist had appeared to say it was OK to relax and have a glass of wine killed more than 300 people. The scientists were eventually acquitted on appeal, but the experience left the scientific community in Italy shaken. One of the largest kinds of volcanic eruptions, called an “ignimbritic eruption” — such as the one that occurred in the Campi Flegrei area around 39,000 years ago — is not what Natale believes could happen any time soon. “It is difficult to study these potential huge eruptions, very rare but very catastrophic, and this is one of the most important but also the most challenging areas of vulcanology,” Natale said. He said the next Campi Flegrei eruption — if one were to occur in the near future — would most likely be more in line with the last significant activity in 1538, which created the 133-meter-tall (463-foot-tall) Monte Nuovo cone visible in the sea. However, due to population growth, the impacts of a similar event could look very different in present day. “That (1538) was a very small eruption, that, if it would happen today, in a densely urbanized area, would be very destructive anyway,” Natale said.",World
British couple died on holiday after adjoining room fumigated for bed bugs," A British couple died from carbon monoxide poisoning while on holiday at a luxury resort in Egypt after the room next door was sprayed with pesticide to kill bed bugs, a coroner has found. John and Susan Cooper were staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in August 2018, when the room next to theirs was fumigated with a pesticide, ‘Lambda’, for a bug infestation, the UK’s PA Media reported. In some countries, Lambda is diluted with the substance dichloromethane, which causes the body to metabolize or ingest carbon monoxide. The fumigated room, which was sealed with masking tape around the door, was connected to theirs with an adjoining door, according to PA. The married couple returned to their room for the night but were found seriously ill the next day by their daughter. John Cooper, 69, was declared dead in the room, while his wife Susan, 63, died hours later in hospital. Dr. James Adelely, senior coroner for the English county of Lancashire, ruled that the deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of inhaling the vapor from spraying the pesticide which contained dichloromethane, PA reported. “To this day, our family struggle to comprehend what happened,” the couple’s daughter Kelly Ormerod, who was on holiday with her parents at the time, said in a statement following the inquest. “It should have never been allowed to happen”. She said that “nothing would make up for the pain and loss we felt since that day,” adding: “The last few years have been the most traumatic and emotional time for all of us involved.”",World
Ukraine claims it hit two Russian landing craft in Crimea with sea drones," Ukraine claimed it hit two Russian landing craft in occupied Crimea with sea drones in an overnight operation, the latest in a series of escalating  strikes on the peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. “Two Russian assault boats have been hit with Ukrainian sea drones near Chernomorske, Crimea,” Andriy Yusov, a representative of Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (GUR), told CNN. GUR put out a video showing what it claims is the moment of the strikes. CNN cannot independently verify the video, date or location. The video appears to show two sea drones approaching targets that appear to be landing craft at a dock. The second drone appears to film the first one as it hits the landing craft. As the second drone approaches its target, the video shows what looks like heavy equipment onboard. “The boats were crewed and loaded with armored vehicles,” GUR claimed in the post on Telegram. Russia has not officially commented on the incident. Kyiv has ramped up assaults on occupied Crimea in recent months, in an attempt to undermine Russian forces. In September, the Ukrainian military unleashed a fierce attack on a Russian naval base in Sevastopol, in what was its most destructive strike on the port since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Russian military blogger Rybar said that in the latest attack, a coordinated assault from the air diverted attention, allowing the Ukrainian sea drones to strike. “The enemy struck the base of the Black Sea Fleet and the Federal Security Service in Chernomorske. They tried to hit the barracks with at least one Neptune anti-ship missile, but the missile landed nearby. Simultaneously, four unmanned boats entered Uzkaya Bay, targeting the Black Sea Fleet boats stationed there,” Rybar said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces intercepted three Ukrainian drones over Crimea in the early hours on Friday. No casualties were reported. GUR claimed Russia used similar landing craft to those destroyed on Thursday in its occupation of Zmiinyi Island, an uninhabited outpost in the Black Sea between Ukraine and occupied Crimea, at the beginning of its full-scale invasion. Since Ukraine has ramped up attacks in the Black Sea, Russian naval air defense capabilities have been degraded and such landing craft have been serving as an alternative platform for air defense systems, according to GUR. “In the conditions of actual lack of shipboard air defense systems after a series of attacks by the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, such boats with air defense systems on board served as cover for the invaders’ ships on the Black Sea Fleet raids,” GUR claimed. Kyiv’s strikes on Crimea are an attempt to isolate the peninsula and make it harder for Russia to sustain its military assault on the Ukrainian mainland, a Ukrainian source familiar with the strategy previously told CNN. The Ukrainian military refocused efforts on striking Crimea after Moscow resumed its siege on Ukrainian ports following the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July, preventing crucial grain exports and threatening global food security.",World
"‘Hope is hard to come by’: In the Red Sea resort of Eilat, Israeli survivors from October 7 face a new threat"," As a red alert alarm sounded in the busy hotel dining hall, many of the children scattered in fear, as the horrors of the Hamas massacre on October 7 came flooding back. Thousands of families who survived the attacks on the Israeli collective communities known as kibbutzim are now homeless and sheltering in hotels along the beaches of the Red Sea resort town of Eilat. But even now, they face a new threat from a different militant group, the Iran-backed Houthis. “Everyone thought that Eilat, southern tip of Israel, would be safe from attacks,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, 60, a resident of the Nir Oz kibbutz. “We have had to endure several alerts and some impacts from missiles and attack drones coming from the Houthis in Yemen.” In recent weeks, the Houthis have claimed several missile and drone attacks against Israel and warned further strikes would come. Israeli jets and its Arrow defense system have been deployed to counter missiles and other “aerial threats” in the Red Sea area. One alarm sounded in Eilat on November 9 when a suicide drone landed on a school a few miles from the hotel, although thankfully there were no children in the building at the time. While the Houthis claimed responsibility for that attack, Israel later said the drone had come from Syria and struck a site there in response. “It’s been absolutely awful,” said Dekel-Chen of the repeated alerts. “All of the kids from a very young age, up to and including teenagers, (you) could see the absolute terror in their eyes, because it just transported them back to that absolute visceral fear of death that they experienced.” As they face this continued threat, the displaced residents are also burying their dead, and campaigning to have their loved ones released from captivity in Gaza. Dekel-Chen’s 35-year-old son Sagui disappeared on October 7, and the family believes he was kidnapped by Hamas. “It’s excruciating,” Dekel-Chen said. “We don’t know if he’s healthy, or wounded. We know nothing… Hope is hard to come by right now.” Dekel-Chen is now helping to care for his two granddaughters and his pregnant daughter-in-law, who is due to have a third child within the next few weeks. Following the October 7 attacks, Israel declared war on Hamas and it has been pounding Gaza with missiles from the air, land and sea, along with a ground offensive which began in late October. Israel says it is targeting the Hamas leadership and network of subterranean tunnels, but the impact on the Palestinian civilian population has been catastrophic, with more than 12,000 killed and at least 30,000 injured and many hospitals unable to function due to a fuel blockade. The worsening humanitarian disaster has caused a global outcry and calls for a pause in fighting, but Israel has insisted that there will be “no ceasefire” without the release of the more than 200 hostages held by Hamas. In Eilat, around 160 survivors from Nir Oz are now living in the Isrotel Yam Suf, a hotel which overlooks the beach and the rust-colored mountains of Jordan just a few miles across the narrow Gulf of Aqaba. But the beauty and tranquillity of this location is shattered by the tales of terror from those living inside. More than a quarter of the community of 400 people in Nir Oz were either killed or kidnapped, residents say, making it one of the worst affected kibbutzim. And 12-year-old Uri Barr doesn’t have enough fingers to count the number of his friends who were taken. “Wow, there is a lot,” Uri said, eyes widening, as he worked out that his family knows at least 20 people who were kidnapped, 12 of them children. Uri and his youngest brother, 8-year-old Noam, and their parents all barricaded themselves into the safe room of their house for six hours in silence, as hundreds of Hamas militants went from house to house, murdering the residents and burning their houses. “(Dad said) Hamas is in the house, be quiet,” Uri told CNN, sitting alongside his father Yonathan. “I heard them screaming in Arabic.” “We heard them breaking into our house and smashing it up, trying to open our safety room door,” Yonathan said. “They were shooting at houses. RPG on houses, grenades on civilians.” The Barr family were lucky to have a safe room which locked from the inside. Most of the residents didn’t, as the shelters were designed for protection from Hamas rockets. Uri’s main concern during those long hours trapped in the room was for his other little brother, 10-year-old Yoav, who had been at a friend’s house on a sleepover the night before. “It was terrible,” Yonathan said. “(Uri) was crying in the safe room because of that.” The family with whom Yoav was staying also survived in their safe room, and the Barrs were reunited later that day, after the Israeli military arrived. “I collapsed, I broke down that moment,” Yonathan said. “(Uri) said it was the first time he saw me cry.” Now Uri’s main worry is for his close friend Eitan, who was taken hostage by Hamas. “He is a very good friend and we (were) playing soccer in the kibbutz,” Uri said, adding that he plans to “hug him” if he escapes from captivity. Uri tries to take his mind off his missing friends by taking part in sports and playing in the water. He’s old enough to be accustomed to hearing the missile alerts, but said some of the younger children panic when they hear the warnings. Nir Adar, a 35-year-old from Nir Oz, said he tries to stay relaxed when the alarms go off, in the hope that his two young daughters understand that they are safe. “They see all the people around running and afraid, so this is what’s really affecting them,” Adar said. Adar and his daughters, 6-year-old Noga and 4-year-old Rani, survived October 7 by hiding in their safe room. The door did not have a lock, so he pulled the handle shut with all of his strength, he said. “The terrorists came to my house, breaking the door and shooting around 10 bullets at the door of the safe room, which at the same time I was holding,” Adar said, adding that the bullets luckily did not penetrate the door. The community’s WhatsApp group chain from that day, now posted online, shows the abject terror the residents were experiencing, minute-by-minute. As Adar sent panicked messages and watched his phone battery drain down, he told his daughters fairy tales and pretended that a tree had fallen on the house to explain why they were trapped. “(My daughter) asked me if this is soldiers in our house, so I said yeah, this is soldiers and they (are) keeping us safe,” he said. “I tried to create them an alternative reality.” When they finally emerged from his home in the late afternoon, Adar realized that his brother’s house – just 20 meters away – had been set ablaze. His brother, 38-year-old Tamir, was kidnapped by Hamas, while his wife and children escaped capture. But Adar fears that even if Tamir has survived to this point, he’ll now never get out. “I’m afraid that the men will stay left behind,” he said, partly because the negotiations for hostage release are currently focused on women and children. Adar said his brother’s children are struggling to cope without their dad. “It’s very hard for them, especially at night,” Adar said. “They’re crying a lot there. They miss him.” The members of the Nir Oz community in Eilat came together to sing in the hotel lounge recently, with the surviving children holding posters of their loved ones. Video of the event seen by CNN showed a little girl breaking down in tears as she held a photo of her father as high as her arms could reach. Adar has also learned that his 85-year-old grandmother was kidnapped by Hamas. “She’s sick, she needs medicines,” Adar said. “I’m not sure if she will be able to survive. Before October 7, Nir Oz was “a kind of garden of Eden in the middle of the desert, thriving community, multigenerational, and what’s left after the Hamas attack is a smoking hole,” Dekel-Chen said. The kibbutz is now largely deserted, apart from a handful of locals who have been managing the site by retrieving valuables and possessions, boarding up houses, and ensuring that damaged water pipes and electricity cables are made safe. Along with up to 200 Hamas attackers who flooded Nir Oz, there were also dozens of unarmed men who looted properties during the six-hour ordeal. Security camera footage that the kibbutz management shared with CNN shows dozens of young men taking away bicycles, often cycling on one and holding another bike to maximize how much they could steal. As anger grows among Israelis about the failures of their government, Connecticut-born Dekel-Chen flew to the United States last week, to attend a march in the capital and meet with White House officials, including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, to advocate on behalf of the families of the hostages. “As a country (this) will take us generations to really work through, not just because of the monumental failures of our government and army as well on that day, but just the ripple effects of the damage done,” Dekel-Chen said. “We were abandoned at our moment of need.” The Nir Oz residents have been told by the government that it will take three years before the kibbutz is rebuilt and ready for their return. But healing the scars from that day will take much longer, and many of the families told CNN they would never go back. “I don’t think we can go back to Nir Oz because what we’ve been through is horror,” Yonathan Barr said. “All the security and safety that we felt in our home is gone. And I won’t do it again to my children.” “The country should protect the civilians and if they can’t do it, (the) deal is broken between the citizens and the state,” Adar said. “How can you live here if you’re not safe?” As they work out their next steps, the families hope that staying together as a community in Eilat will help the grieving process. “Children are resilient, if surrounded by love,” Dekel-Chen said. “(But) most of them are terrified to be more than a meter or two from their parents,” he added, and they are “incredibly fearful of any sound that isn’t normal, or any person that they don’t know.” The families are receiving psychological therapy and the children are attending a kids’ club, but they haven’t been in school for a month – and their uncertain future is unsettling the whole community. The key focus for the families now is to grieve their loved ones, and to bring back the hostages. “The main idea is that we want our people to come back,” Yonathan said. “It’s like we need them, (for) us to be whole again.”",World
What we know about what Israel says it has found at Al-Shifa," Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has become a flashpoint in Israel’s war against Hamas, which began when gunmen from the militant group crossed the border into Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people. Palestinians and humanitarian agencies say the current fighting in and around Al-Shifa is proof of Israel’s wanton disregard for civilian life in Gaza, while Israel accuses Hamas of using the medical center as a shield for its operations. On top of providing medical care, the Al-Shifa Hospital had recently become a key shelter for thousands of Palestinian civilians fleeing Israeli bombardment. Since launching its operation at the hospital on November 15, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have shown images of a tunnel shaft and military equipment, but have yet to show conclusive proof of the large-scale command and control center it alleges is there. Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry and hospital officials have denied Israel’s claims, saying that hospitals in the Strip have only been used to treat patients. Doctors in Al-Shifa have also sounded the alarm about deteriorating conditions inside the medical facility, which is struggling to meet patients’ needs amid supply shortages and the presence of Israeli troops. The IDF is now under pressure to prove Israel’s long-standing assertion with its promise of “concrete evidence.” Its ability to continue its operation in Gaza, and the credibility of Israel, could be at stake as the number killed in Gaza surpasses 12,000, according to authorities in the Hamas-controlled Strip. Here’s what we know so far. For weeks, the IDF said Hamas has been using Gaza’s largest hospital as cover for what it calls terror infrastructure below ground. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Hamas had a command and control center or headquarters underneath the hospital complex grounds, which other senior Israeli officials have also insisted on. In a presentation to the media last month, Hagari claimed that Hamas was directing rocket attacks and commanding operations from bunkers underneath the hospital building, which he said were linked to a network of tunnels that Hamas had dug underneath Gaza City. The IDF also published an “intelligence-based” illustrated video of what it claims the Hamas headquarters under Al-Shifa looks like. The video shows a 3D diagram of the hospital, which moves to show an animated network of purported tunnels and operation rooms. CNN cannot independently verify Israel’s claims that Hamas is operating a “command and control center” from the hospital. The White House has backed Israel’s claims, saying that Hamas was storing weapons and operating a command node from Al-Shifa, citing US intelligence. But senior US officials have declined multiple times to expand on how they can corroborate Israel’s claims, as the US does not have a presence on the ground in Gaza. Over the weekend, the IDF took CNN and other news organizations to a newly exposed tunnel shaft on the grounds of the Al-Shifa hospital complex that it says was used by Hamas. The structure appeared to be substantial, with the remains of a ladder hanging over the opening and a pole that looked like a hub for a spiral staircase running through the middle of the shaft. The IDF also released video – filmed on Friday – from inside the shaft, showing a staircase leading down into a concrete tunnel that the military said was 55 meters long and located 10 meters underground. At the end of the tunnel is a metal door with a small window, according to the video, which the IDF said it had not yet opened to the possibility that Hamas had booby-trapped it. The video is arguably the most compelling evidence thus far that the IDF has offered that there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. It does not, however, establish without a doubt that there is a command center under Al-Shifa. The Israeli military on Sunday also presented several videos that it said illustrated Hamas’ presence at Al-Shifa hospital, including CCTV footage that appeared to show hostages being brought through the hospital itself and separate footage from inside a tunnel shaft on the medical compound’s grounds. CNN cannot independently verify the content of the videos. The CCTV footage showed Hamas fighters moving a Nepalese hostage and a Thai hostage through the hospital on October 7, IDF spokesperson Hagari said. One appears to be frog-marched through the building, while another appears to be bleeding and is pushed on a gurney. Hagari did not spell out how the IDF had acquired the videos, though he did say that Israeli intelligence officers were part of the operation inside the hospital to try to locate the hostages. Hagari also dismissed suggestions that the hostages had been brought to the hospital because they were wounded, claiming that one of the two hostages in the videos was not injured and did not need medical treatment. They had been brought to the hospital first before being moved to hiding spots like nearby apartments, he said. The shared CCTV footage comes after Israel’s military said it found the bodies of two Israeli hostages – a 65-year-old woman and an Israeli soldier – in the same neighborhood as Al-Shifa hospital. The IDF had previously touted other alleged discoveries on the hospital grounds, saying soldiers located a room in Al-Shifa where they found “technological assets, along with military and combat equipment used by Hamas” for “terrorist purposes.” Hamas has rejected those claims as “baseless lies.” CNN analysis of separate footage published online by the IDF prior to visits from international media outlets suggests weaponry at Al-Shifa may have been rearranged. An IDF video on November 15 showed a military spokesperson touring the facility, during which an AK-47 gun is seen behind an MRI machine. Fox News and the BBC were subsequently granted access to the hospital. In their reports filmed after the IDF clip, two AK-47 guns are visible in the same location. It is unclear where the second assault rifle came from. The IDF told CNN the discrepancy between the military’s own video and the BBC footage was “due to the fact that more weaponry and terrorist assets were discovered throughout the day.” “Suggestions that the IDF is manipulating the media are incorrect,” it said. The United Nations has called for access to the site for an independent investigation into the competing allegations and warned that hospitals should not be used as battlegrounds for any side. Israel’s allegations have been vehemently denied by Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry, and hospital officials. The director general of the Hamas-controlled health ministry, Dr. Medhat Abbas, told CNN that hospitals in the enclave “are used to treat patients only” and are not being used “to hide anyone.” The health ministry responded to the images of hostages inside Al-Shifa released Sunday by the IDF by questioning their authenticity – but went on to say that if true, the pictures showed that hospitals in Gaza provided medical care to anyone who needed it. In a statement issued Saturday before the release of the CCTV videos, Hamas said it had brought several hostages to hospitals for medical treatment after they were injured in Israeli air strikes. After Israel launched its operation, Hamas accused the US of giving Israel “a green light … to commit more massacres against civilians” by amplifying what it called a “false narrative” that a militant command center lies somewhere inside Al-Shifa. More than five days since the IDF raided Al-Shifa hospital, Israeli troops are still on hospital grounds, and the facility is still filled with patients and medical staff operating in dire humanitarian circumstances. Doctors who are still at the hospital cannot treat patients due to heavy shelling in the past week. Fuel shortages and a lack of electricity prevent them running incubators for the babies. ICU patients and several neonatal babies in Al-Shifa have died in recent days. A doctor inside Al-Shifa hospital told CNN Monday that staff movements around the complex were being restricted, and Israeli forces are questioning staff about Hamas and tunnels. Dr. Ahmed El Mokhallalati, head of the burns unit, said the hospital is also running out of urgent requirements, including anesthetics, oxygen tanks, medicine and blood banks. Israel’s Defense Ministry says it delivered more than 6,000 liters of water and 2,300 kg of food — including fish, canned food, bread, spreads and dates — over the weekend. El Mokhallalati also told CNN that Israeli forces had removed about 200 bodies from the hospital’s mortuary as well as from mass graves recently dug on the site. “They brought two trucks and they have taken all the dead bodies out of the hospital,” he said. Several days ago, Israel’s army spokesman Hagari dodged a question about whether Israel had taken bodies out of the hospital complex as part of its efforts to determine the fate of hostages kidnapped from communities in southern Israel on October 7. A group of UN humanitarian workers visited Al-Shifa on Saturday, describing the hospital as a “death zone” where “signs of shelling and gunfire” were evident. An Egyptian government official told CNN Monday that 28 of 31 premature babies that were evacuated from Al-Shifa to southern Gaza have arrived in Egypt through the Rafah crossing. The three remaining babies remained in Gaza but are still alive, the official added. The sprawling medical facility of Al-Shifa, which sits in the western part of Gaza City, was built in 1946 when Gaza was still under British rule. It has long been seen as the backbone of medical services across the besieged Gaza Strip, and Israel’s operations there have compounded a grim humanitarian crisis, Palestinian health officials have said.

CNN visited the exposed tunnel shaft in the Al-Shifa hospital compound. Here’s what we saw," Even in the darkness, the utter devastation in northern Gaza is clear as day. The empty shells of buildings, illuminated by the last shreds of light, lurch out of the landscape on the dirt roads across the Gaza Strip. At night, the only signs of life are the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles that rumble the landscape, tightening the military’s grip on the northern sector. On Saturday night, we traveled with the IDF into Gaza to see the newly exposed tunnel shaft discovered at the compound of Al-Shifa Hospital, the enclave’s largest medical facility. After crossing the border fence at around 9:00 in the evening, our convoy of Humvees turned off its lights, relying on night vision goggles to traverse the Gaza Strip. We would spend the next six hours inside Gaza, much of that time spent getting back and forth from the tunnel shaft. Along our path, virtually every building bore the scars of wartime damage. Many structures were destroyed entirely, while others were hardly recognizable as anything more than twisted metal. If there was life here, it had long since departed. Residents had either moved south or been killed during six weeks of war. Our first stop was a location on the beach where the IDF had set up a staging area. From there, we moved into armored personnel carriers with several other reporters for the last kilometer to the hospital. The only view outside came through a night-vision screen. But even in black and white, the level of destruction was shocking. Inside Gaza City, the skeletal remains of apartment towers and high-rise buildings packed the otherwise vacant city streets. Even if we could speak to Palestinians while embedded with the IDF, there was no one around to talk to. CNN reported from inside Gaza under IDF media escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join this embed, media outlets had to submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for review and agreed not to reveal sensitive locations and soldiers’ identities. CNN retained editorial control over the final report. As we stepped out of the armored vehicle, we were enveloped by utter darkness. We were only allowed to use our red lights to navigate to a nearby building, where we waited until Israeli forces already on the ground secured the area. The tunnel shaft was very close by, but it was entirely exposed. The commander in charge of our group, Lt. Col. Tom said this tunnel is significantly larger than others he had seen before. “This is a big tunnel,” he said. “I have encountered tunnels — in 2014 in [Operation] Protective Edge, I was a company commander — and this tunnel is an order of magnitude bigger than a standard tunnel.” We had expected to hear fighting once we entered Gaza City itself. Instead, we heard almost complete silence. Only once during our roughly 45 minutes at the hospital did we hear the distant sound of small arms fire, and it was impossible to tell how far away it was in the midst of an urban environment. The rest of the time, the silence made the darkness feel even more oppressive. It was nearing midnight as we walked the last few feet to the exposed tunnel shaft. The IDF had promised “concrete evidence” that Hamas was using the hospital complex above ground as cover for what it called terror infrastructure underneath, including a command and control hub. Several days earlier, the IDF had released what it said was the first batch of evidence, which included weapons and ammunition they said they found inside the hospital itself. But the pictures were a far cry from proving that Hamas had a facility underneath, and a CNN investigation found that some of the guns had been moved around. The discovery of the tunnel shaft the next day was more compelling, showing an entrance to something underground. But even then, it was unclear what it was or how far down it went. This is what everyone has been trying to understand. Standing on the edge of the tunnel shaft, it was apparent that the structure itself was substantial. At the top, the remains of a ladder hung over the lip of the opening. In the center of the round shaft, a center pole looked like a hub for a spiral staircase. The shaft itself extended down farther than we could see, especially in the meager light of our headlamps. Video released by the IDF from inside the shaft showed what we could not see from the top of the opening. The video shows a spiral staircase leading down into a concrete tunnel. The IDF said the tunnel shaft extends downwards approximately 10 meters and the tunnel runs for 55 meters. At its end stands a metal door with a small window. “We need to demolish the underground facility that we found,” said IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. “I think the leadership of Hamas is in great pressure because we found this facility, and we are now going to demolish it. It’s going to take us time. We’re going to do it safely, but we’re going to do it.” It is arguably the most compelling evidence thus far that the IDF has offered that there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. It does not establish without a doubt that there is a command center under Gaza’s largest hospital, but it is clear that there is a tunnel down below. Seeing what connects to that tunnel is absolutely critical. For Israel, the stakes could not be higher. Israel has publicly asserted for weeks, if not years, that Hamas has built terror infrastructure below the hospital. The ability to continue to prosecute the war in the face of mounting international criticism depends to a large extent on Israel being able to prove this point. Hamas has repeatedly denied that there is a network of tunnels below Shifa hospital. Health officials who have spoken with CNN have said the same, insisting it is only a medical facility. As is so rarely the case in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this answer truly is black and white. Either there is an underground series of tunnels below the hospital. Or there is not. Clarification: The headline on this story has been updated to reflect that the tunnel shaft was discovered on the grounds of the Al-Shifa hospital complex.",World
"One evacuated from northern Gaza, the other didn’t. They’re in the same hospital now"," When Rami Mahmoud left his family’s home to buy food, his wife, Elham Maged, stayed behind to pray. When he made his way back through the narrow, tightly packed nearby streets of northern Gaza’s Jabalya Refugee Camp﻿, he returned to a scene of complete chaos. An Israeli airstrike had smashed into the center of the densely populated community, tearing a deep crater into its heart. Their apartment had vanished. Scanning the devastation, Mahmoud suddenly noticed a single finger reaching up between the rubble; it was Elham. Miraculously she had survived. But his relief at finding her alive was brief. Two of their children, they would soon discover, were dead.  Nothing would ever be the same again. Two weeks on from the horror of that day, the couple are more than 200 miles southwest of Gaza City, inside Cairo’s Nasser Medical Institute in neighboring Egypt. The wreckage and chaos of their shattered home was replaced by the cleanliness and order of this foreign medical facility, the noise of rockets and explosions exchanged for the benign, insistent hum of traffic crawling through Egypt’s bustling capital. But safety and care does not bring comfort; they are still haunted by grief. “My daughter, just an hour before she died, she called her best friend and said, ‘I feel like something is going to happen to me. Can you take care of my mother and visit her often?’” Elham told us. “My son is a handsome boy, he was in high school, he used to go to the gym and lift weights, and he is tall and well built,” she continued, tears streaming down her face. “He liked to look good. He got a haircut two days before he was killed, in the middle of war. He said, ‘even if I die, I want to die looking good.’” Mahmoud shared family photos with us.  Their daughter, just 15, her wide, clear eyes and delicate features framed by a headscarf; their son, 17, carrying a small boy on his back, a warm smile shining from beneath his tousled black hair. “God created them, God took them,” his wife said. “I just want to go back to the rest of my children. There is no internet there, so I don’t know anything about them. I know they are with their grandfather somewhere safe, hopefully, but we have no way of reaching them.” Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 12,000 Palestinians since October 7, including an estimated 5,000 children, according to the Hamas government press office. Israel says its airstrikes intend to target Hamas commanders and infrastructure, following the militant group’s October 7 terror attacks, which left 1,200 people dead in Israel and saw about 240 taken hostage. The Israeli military has focused its ground operations in northern Gaza – where Rami and Elham lived – and where it claims to have now seized control. Gaza civilians in the north have been ordered to evacuate southward, but airstrikes do not spare that part of the densely-inhabited enclave, either. Muhammed Wadea blames himself for following the Israeli evacuation orders, telling CNN that he made the decision to heed the IDF’s warnings and move his family out of their home to head south. On October 16, he and his young children found themselves in the southern city of Khan Younis, where another apparent Israeli strike tore into the building in which they were sheltering. Today Wadea’s 9-year-old son, Abdelrahman, shares a hospital room at Nasser Medical Institute with his 14-year-old sister. Both children sustained multiple injuries in the strike – broken bones, skin torn from their bodies, shrapnel lodged in flesh. Abdelrahman recalled that one moment he was sitting on a sofa eating potato chips with his cousin, the next he awoke beneath rubble and surrounded by carnage. There was no warning, nor was there any sign of Hamas where they were staying, Wadea said, standing restlessly by his children, pain etched on his face as he wrestled with heartbreaking guilt. He began to weep as he spoke. “I hope that Abdelrahman’s siblings are fine and alive,” he said. “May God have mercy on them. I have nine children. My eldest, Riham is 18, she is married. My youngest is 4 years old.” Both Wadea and Mahmoud’s families left Gaza through Rafah Crossing, the only way out of the Palestinian enclave since Israel sealed other exits after the October 7 attack. A limited number of injured Palestinians and foreign nationals have been allowed to flee Gaza into Egypt through Rafah, following a deal brokered by Qatar between Israel, Hamas, and Egypt, in coordination with the United States. Nasser Medical Institute is one of 37 hospitals that have been readied to accept injured evacuees from Gaza, Egypt’s health minister, Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, told CNN. More than 1,100 beds, 1,700 ICU units, as well as facilities such as incubators, have been set aside, he explained. As of this week more than 200 places have been filled, but the trickle of those able to cross the border since November 1 remains slow. On Friday, more than 550 foreign nationals and 45 injured Palestinians, along with 40 companions, left Gaza through the crossing, an Egyptian border official told a journalist working with CNN in Rafah. Among those making the treacherous journey is one particularly vulnerable group. Last week, Egyptian officials were expecting three dozen newborn infants to be evacuated to Egypt after being born into the harshest of environments at Al-Shifa hospital. At Al-Shifa hospital, the IDF’s controversial operation to uncover what both Israeli and US intelligence insist is a Hamas command and control center has seen electricity dwindle to exhaustion – and with it the critical ability to pump oxygen into incubators, vital to the survival of these helpless newborns. Thirty-one babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa hospital on Sunday to the southern Gazan city of Rafah; Palestinian authorities said several newborns had died due to power outages and a shortage of medical supplies. On Monday, 28 babies arrived in Egypt from Gaza at the Rafah crossing, according to an Egyptian government official. One baby was discharged in Gaza and went home with his parents to their temporary shelter, while two others stayed in the ICU unit of the Emirati hospital in Rafah, Gaza. Israel’s siege of Gaza has included a near-total blockade of food, water and electricity, with exceptions for what the United Nations has called a “trickle” of humanitarian aid. Conditions in Gaza have grown desperate as fuel supplies dwindle, forcing the closure of 26 of the enclave’s 35 hospitals. Ghaffar told CNN last week that Egypt was poised to receive these tiny, delicate souls headed on the fraught route to the Rafah border crossing, but as the clock ticked, the atmosphere was growing ever more tense. “Time is important,” he said. “Every single minute that we’re not getting them in… the chance of losing their life is very high.” The subtext was clear; in these bleakest, darkest of hours, some tragedies are playing out beyond the reach of those who might be able to avert them.",World
‘Never going back:’ Israelis evacuated from border town with Lebanon fear war with Hezbollah," It should be the height of tourist season in Tiberias, an Israeli city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee where the New Testament says many of Jesus’ miracles were performed. But instead of pilgrims, thousands of Israelis evacuated from communities close to the Lebanese border have arrived in Tiberias, swelling the city’s population by 20% Mayor Boaz Yosef told CNN. He described the evacuation as “the biggest” movement of Israelis in decades. In the weeks since Hamas launched its attack on Israel, a low intensity conflict has been raging in the north of the country as crossfire between Israel and Lebanon-based militants becomes increasingly deadly. A Reuters journalist is among the civilians to have been killed on the Lebanese side of the border, and last Sunday an employee of an Israeli electric supplier was killed in a strike by an anti-tank missile in the Israeli border town of Dovev. Like its south, Israel’s northern border area has been emptying, after the Defense Ministry ordered the mandatory evacuation of more than 40 communities there in October. There are fears of a full-blown confrontation with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon – that would open up a dangerous new front in the war. Several of Dovev’s evacuees, who have been living in Tiberias for a month, told CNN that they may never be ready to return to their moshav (cooperative community). Dovev residents point to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who has repeatedly evoked a hypothetical scenario in which his fighters would conduct an incursion into northern Israel in case war erupted between Lebanon and Israel again. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The Iran-backed Islamist movement, which has its main base on the Israel-Lebanon border, has participated in several conflicts in the Middle East, including in Iraq and Syria. Border skirmishes between Israel and the group have escalated in the past two weeks with the cross-fire intensifying in frequency and depth of territory in the border region. From the basement of a hotel in Tiberias, where dozens of evacuated children were attending a makeshift lesson, Elana Pilveny told CNN that there was “no way in hell I am going back.” Her family is not taking any chances with Hamas’ ally in southern Lebanon after October 7, when Hamas massacred 1,200 people, many of whom were civilians. A quiet knitting circle in the hotel lobby, consisting of four cousins who have lived in Dovev for decades, belies the panic among the evacuees. “I don’t know how to function normally if I have to go back to Dovev,” Shoshana Yakut, 77, told CNN from a hotel in Tiberias where she has lived for over a month. They have lived through the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and fight with Hezbollah in 2006. “We never felt something so powerful,” she said of the October 7 attacks. “Not in 67, not in 73, or not in 82 and 2006 – this is a whole new level of fear right now.” Pilveny owns a small poultry farm in Dovev with her husband and said the electric company’s worker who died last week was there to restore a powerline to the community’s chicken farms. Her husband has since asked Israel’s agricultural ministry to humanely slaughter their chickens, she said. From his office, looking over the azure Sea of Galilee, Tiberias mayor Yosef said more than 10,000 people have been evacuated to his city, filling up 35 hotels in the town – which is 30 kilometers south of the border. He says residents have “embraced” the newcomers but the war has hurt the local tourism industry: Restaurants stand empty and boat tours are few and far between. The international community has been attempting to avert a wider regional war. But Yosef said he believes that to ensure the safety of Israel “we must make war in Lebanon” in order to dismantle Hezbollah’s capabilities, citing the dangers of the group’s estimated arsenal of 150,000 rockets and precision-guided munitions. “If not, what happened in the south (of Israel) will happen in the north,” he said, adding this was the view of other mayors in northern Israel. Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a warning to Hezbollah following a day of cross-border exchanges, saying: “What we’re doing in Gaza can also be done in Beirut. We didn’t use even 10% of the Air Force’s capabilities in Gaza.” At another hotel in Tiberias, 75-year-old veteran David Shenfer, who was evacuated from the town of Kiryat Shmona near the northern tip of Israel, said that while he cannot wait to return home but worries about the violence with Hezbollah. The ideal situation is a “political solution” where Hezbollah withdraws behind Lebanon’s Litani River, he said, citing a 2006 United Nations’ resolution that called for Hezbollah to not operate between the Israeli-Lebanese border and the river 13 miles (20km) to its north. Hezbollah continues to operate south of the river and Israel has routinely violated the resolution with territorial breaches through overflights in Lebanon. Absent a political agreement “they are going to have to force Hezbollah to go north,” Shenfer said. The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War saw an attempt to create a buffer zone in that area, but the conflict ended with no clear victor or vanquished. Many parts of Lebanon were devastated, but Hezbollah foiled Israel’s ultimate plan to dismantle the group. The overwhelming worry among the evacuated is when they can make it home, or whether they will at all, and if not, what will be next? The spokesperson for Kibbutz Bar’am, one of 30 kibbutzim in the country that have stuck to a socialist model, said her main concern is what the war will do to their community model. “We’ve lost a lot of certainty we had before,” Lea Raivitz said. Residents in her kibbutz put forward their entire net salary to the community and receive a monthly budget in return. As a result, “we don’t pay for the houses. We don’t pay for the electricity. We don’t pay for the water, health, healthcare, education,” she said. After spending a month in a hotel, there is a fear some kibbutz members will move away. While she is determined to return to her hillside community, the prospect currently seems impossible, Raivitz said, explaining that Hezbollah militants have hoisted flags near a border fence close to the kibbutz. “It’s our home, we’re waiting for that moment (to return), but it’s difficult to even imagine.”",World
Five countries ask International Criminal Court to investigate the situation in Palestinian territories," The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor Karim Khan says his office has received a referral from five countries to investigate whether crimes have been committed in the Palestinian territories as part of Israel’s response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti submitted the referral, Khan said. “In accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, a State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of such crimes,” Khan said in a statement. He noted that his office was already conducting an investigation on the situation in the Palestinian territories over possible crimes committed since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. The investigation began in March 2021. “It is ongoing and extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the attacks that took place on 7 October 2023,” Khan said. “In accordance with the Rome Statute, my Office has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of a State Party and with respect to the nationals of States Parties.” Both Hamas and Israel have been accused of war crimes as the death toll from the conflict mounts. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed nearly 11,500 Palestinians since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws on medical sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. Israel says its airstrikes intend to target Hamas commanders and infrastructure, following the militant group’s October 7 terror attacks which left 1,200 people dead in Israel and saw 240 taken hostage. Israel’s siege of Gaza has included a near-total blockade of food, water and electricity, with exceptions for what the United Nations has called a “trickle” of humanitarian aid. On Friday however, Israel’s war cabinet agreed to allow two fuel tankers to enter Gaza each day to support water and sewage systems. The conflict is covered by a complex system of international law developed after World War II, which attempts to balance humanitarian concerns and the military requirements of states. A UN report said last month said it was collecting evidence of war crimes in the wake of the Hamas attack. The report said Israel may be committing the war crime of collective punishment, after the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the “complete siege” of Gaza. A number of prominent human rights groups concur with the UN’s assessment. Earlier this month, Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the October 7 attacks “atrocities”, saying they – and the holding of hostages – were war crimes. But he added “the collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians.” The South African government has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. In a statement last month, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation accused Israel of war crimes and said “the continual bombardment of civilian targets, the denial of the civilian population of Gaza of water, food, fuel, and electricity is prohibited under International Humanitarian Law and by Geneva Conventions.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called accusations that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza “hogwash.” “We’re deliberately doing everything in our power to target the terrorists, and the civilians – as happens in every legitimate war – are sometimes what are called collateral damage,” he told NBC News on Sunday. Israel is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court’s jurisdiction. That has not stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. Fatou Bensouda, then the ICC’s prosecutor, spent five years conducting a “painstaking preliminary examination” and concluded she was “satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.” But no arrests were made, and Bensouda left office in 2021. Khan has said previously that the acts committed by Hamas on October 7 are “serious violations, if proven, of international humanitarian law.” He also stressed that “Israel has clear obligations in relation to its war with Hamas: Not just moral obligations, but legal obligations… It’s there in the Geneva Conventions. It’s there in black and white.”",World
Liberia’s President George Weah concedes victory after tight run-off election," Liberia’s President, George Weah, has conceded defeat to opposition candidate Joseph Boakai after a tight run-off election. Weah, a former soccer star, called Boakai after the country’s National Elections Commission (NEC) released provisional results on Friday. Boakai, a 78-year-old former vice president of Liberia, won 51% of the votes, after the final results were tallied by the elections commission on Monday. In an address to the nation, Weah said: “The results announced tonight, though not final, indicate that Ambassador Joseph N. Boakai is in a lead that we cannot surpass. Therefore, a few minutes ago, I spoke with President-elect Joseph N. Boakai to congratulate him on his victory. “Tonight, as we acknowledge the results, let us also recognize that the true winners of these elections are the people of Liberia,” he added. In his victory speech on Monday, Boakai hailed his supporters, saying he was “incredibly proud and satisfied” to be endorsed by them as the country’s next president. “My foremost priority and top-most national agenda remain the pursuit of national prosperity for our people,” he further said, adding that his government will “assert, boldly and unapologetically, an ambitious program of recovery … a path towards economic growth and development, … robust training and decent jobs for our youths, and social protection for our elderly and disabled citizens.” President Weah was voted into office in 2018 and will step down in January. A run-off was triggered when Weah, 57, secured a victory in an earlier October poll with a margin of just 7,000 votes over his political rival, Boakai. However, he fell short of the required 50% threshold necessary to clinch an outright victory. Weah was seeking reelection for a second six-year term after a tumultuous first tenure tainted by corruption scandals and allegations of mismanagement. He has been praised for immediately conceding ensuring, a peaceful transfer of power - a significant milestone in Liberia’s fragile democracy, which has seen civil war and previous leaders killed in office. There have also been a spate of coups in West and Central Africa in recent years. Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu was among the first to congratulate the new President-elect while also commending Weah’s “sterling example, undiluted patriotism, and statesmanship. He has defied the stereotype that peaceful transitions of power are untenable in West Africa,” a statement from Nigeria’s presidency said.",World
‘They called me a slave’: Witness testimony exposes alleged RSF-led campaign to enslave men and women in Sudan," Mahdi, 16, was blindfolded when a strange man felt for his biceps. He was looking for a “strong” boy to use as a farmhand. The size of his muscles helped the man determine Mahdi’s price as he bought him from a militiaman who had captured him in the West Darfur capital of El Geneina. “They hit me and called me a slave. And they kept hitting me,” Mahdi said of his captors and other unknown men. “I’d crouch down and they’d smack me in the neck.” His harrowing testimony was among dozens – including accounts from women who alleged sexual enslavement – collected as part of an exclusive documentary by CNN about the humanitarian toll exacted by the ongoing fight between Sudan’s ruling military and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The documentary, which will air this Sunday on “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper,” exposes an RSF-led campaign to enslave men and women in El Geneina, the largest city controlled by the paramilitary group in Sudan’s Darfur region. A CNN team in the Chadian refugee camp of Adre, across the border from El Geneina, spoke to over a dozen witnesses who described the abduction of people en masse, with women forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for food and water and both men and women being traded by their captors. Their accounts shed further light on the violence in the genocide-scarred western Sudanese region over the past five months. To protect the witnesses and survivors, CNN is not identifying them by their real names. The apparent atrocities peaked after the RSF — which a CNN investigation has shown is backed by Russian mercenary group Wagner — captured El Geneina in mid-June. In the days that followed, a man named Khalid said he saw RSF-uniformed fighters escorting over a dozen shackled women into the El Geneina Industrial School, where he worked as a teacher. “They flogged them with whips that they use on animals while the girls were screaming,” said Khalid, who told CNN he watched the scene unfold from his hiding place behind a pile of chopped wood in the school compound. He only came out of hiding when night fell. Throughout the day, he said, he saw the fighters forcing women into classrooms at gunpoint, after which he said he heard sounds that indicated torture and rape. Many of the women, Khalid said, appeared to have been trafficked from further north in Sudan — where women’s style of dress can display relative affluence, and where the tribal and racial mix is typified by generally lighter complexions. Several Sudan-based rights groups, including the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA) and the government’s Combating Violence Against Women Unit, have told CNN that they believe the RSF abducted dozens of women from the capital, Khartoum, trafficking them to the paramilitary group’s strongholds in Darfur. Rights group activists say they have spoken to scores of local sources who said the women appeared to have been sexually exploited by the RSF. In Adre, CNN spoke to four other witnesses, in addition to Khalid, who said they saw evidence of RSF trafficking women from northern Sudan. One former abductee from Darfur— who CNN is not naming — said she saw a 4x4 vehicle roll up into an Arab neighborhood in El Geneina, carrying four women who appeared to be northern Sudanese women in the back. She said she saw an RSF fighter approach the driver and ask how much he was willing to “sell” the women for. She recalled hearing the driver boast that he had “handpicked the women” and that “no amount of cash” would make him release them to the RSF fighter. ‘To us you are all slaves’ The trafficking of women from Arab-majority areas in the north of the country has become a widely discussed practice in Sudan, with widespread reports of RSF fighters demanding ransoms for their release. In Darfur, captured women from non-Arab tribes appear to have been treated differently — the apparent sexual exploitation of women tends to involve shorter periods of captivity, and their abuse is reported by dozens of witnesses, survivors and activists to be racially fuelled. The RSF, a largely Arab fighting force that has been accused of ethnically cleansing non-Arab tribes in Darfur, is widely named as the culprit of wide-scale sexual exploitation there. The RSF has not responded to CNN’s request for comment about allegations of sexual enslavement. The paramilitary group has previously denied allegations of conducting an ethnic cleansing campaign and committing sexual violence, in Darfur. According to a Human Rights Watch report published in August, the RSF raped “several dozen women and girls” in El Geneina between late April and late June. “The assailants appear to have targeted people because of their Masalit ethnicity and, in some cases, because they were known activists,” the report said. Several former Darfuri abductees told CNN that fighters from the RSF and their Arab militia allies hurled racist abuse at them during their captivity. One 22-year-old woman named Raghm said she was kidnapped by an RSF-uniformed fighter from her home and detained in a brothel. She said she heard her captor receiving money in exchange for her enslavement in the brothel — up to 7,000 Sudanese pounds, the equivalent of $10. “He said to me: ‘To us you all are slaves. To us you are not free,’” said Raghm, who belongs to the Masalit tribe, the main target of the RSF’s revived apparent ethnic cleansing campaign. Between beatings, she said she recalled him saying: “You are dirt. You are a disgrace.” In Arabic, the word for ‘slave’ is a racial slur equivalent to the n-word. Another woman told CNN she and the female members of her family were raped in captivity for four days. “They locked my mother, myself, and my sisters up for four days and they raped us,” said 20-year-old Hawa. “On the fifth day, we fled. We saw some of (the Arab militia) on the street and they flogged us with whips. They told us to run for our lives, and cursed us, calling us donkeys and goats. “The children were exhausted, barely walking a few steps before they collapsed,” she said. CNN also found evidence of the enslavement of males as part of the attack on El Geneina. Mahdi, the 16-year-old boy, told CNN he was kidnapped by the RSF with his brother and that he heard RSF fighters negotiating his “price” to work as a farmhand. He listened to the back-and-forth between his captors and other men while he was blindfolded, his hand and feet bound by rope. They felt his biceps because they said they “wanted a strong one,” he told CNN. He said he spent 10 days in the house that he was sold to before escaping and making it to the relative safety of Chad. The brother who was taken at the same time as him was killed by the RSF, he said. The documentary to be aired Sunday is the latest in a series of CNN investigations into atrocities committed by the RSF in Sudan. In recent months, CNN has uncovered how the Russian mercenary group Wagner has backed the RSF throughout this war, as well as evidence of arbitrary executions, wholesale destruction of homes, and forced displacement of Sudanese civilians.",World
Disturbing videos emerge showing atrocities against African ethnic groups in Darfur," Members of African ethnic groups in Sudan’s Darfur region appear to have been rounded up by members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and other Arab militias, according to videos and images verified and geolocated by CNN. The videos emerged over the past two weeks. In one of them shared online and geolocated to Ardamata, an outlying district in El Geneina city in West Darfur state, racist slurs can be heard as men in fatigues refer to the captives as “dogs” and tell them to “gather here”. In another cut of the video, the same men in fatigues can be seen whipping the men. At one point the men appear to be forced to run down the street. A man fires shots. In another video, filmed less than a five-minute drive from the first video, the RSF logo appears visible on the uniforms of some of the men dressed in light colored fatigues who appear to be controlling the men huddled together on the ground. The word “liquidation” is mentioned and the words “slay them.” The RSF on November 4 announced it had taken over the main army base in El Geneina (the 15th division headquarters), close to where these videos were filmed. A Reuters reporter spoke to three men fleeing from Darfur into Chad on November 7 who said they had witnessed killings by Arab militias and RSF forces targeting the Masalit ethnic group in Ardamata, the news agency reported. “Sickening reports and images coming from Ardamata, West Darfur, inc [sic] of assassinations, grave violations and massacres of civilians, following RSF takeover of area. Those with authority must uphold international humanitarian law, protect civilians, ensure rule of law and provide unfettered humanitarian access to vulnerable persons,” the UN’s deputy humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Toby Harward, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. In another video that circulated on Tuesday, over a dozen bodies are piled together in what appears to be a mass grave. Three men inside the ditch throw sand on the bodies in an apparently half-hearted attempt to bury them. A voice from behind the camera barks orders at them. It is unclear where the video was filmed, but one of the men helping bury the dead says he is from El Geneina. Halfway through the video, a man sits up from among the bodies, the dust falling off his face. “Hey! That guy’s alive,” shouts a voice from behind the camera. “Kill him,” shouts another man shortly before the video ends. CNN does not know the fate of the men concerned. It’s also unclear whether the men filmed in the ditch are the same men as those seen in the video running from RSF soldiers and militia loyal to the RSF. The RSF has denied that “any incidents of ethnic cleansing or tribal conflict took place in the Ardmetta [Ardamata] area of El Geneina, West Darfur State.” In a statement responding to questions from CNN last Wednesday, the RSF said it does not target civilians and that its forces are “fighting side-by-side with the people of Sudan to restore our country to its rightful path of civilian-led democratic rule.” The paramilitary group said, however, that as a result of the conflict between RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the Ardamata neighborhood, their actions “did unfortunately result in the displacement of civilians” as the military zone is located amid residential areas. “The conflict ended with our forces seizing control of the SAF 15th Infantry Division and liberating the division headquarters,” the statement said, adding that “since the division was liberated, Ardmetta has seen no further acts of aggression or armed conflict. Residents have returned to their homes, and security has stabilized, allowing life to resume as normal.” Amid the most significant increase in displacement in months, aid agencies operating in Chad say arrivals from Sudan have been describing a new surge in killings and fighting in West Darfur. Ethnic-related killings have intensified since fighting broke out mid-April between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, according to witnesses and aid groups operating in the region. In September, the United Nations’ human rights body (UNJHRO) said it had received reports of at least 13 mass graves in El Geneina believed to contain civilians from the ethnic Masalit tribe who were allegedly killed in attacks by the RSF and allied Arab militias. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Tuesday that, following increased fighting in El Geneina, its teams working across the border in eastern Chad have seen an “immediate and major increase in the number of people arriving in the region.” “Our people there in Ardamata were killed and displaced. Children are slaughtered, women’s money and belongings are robbed, and they can’t escape,” one Sudanese woman, Nabila Abdel Rahman, told Reuters on Tuesday. In neighboring South Sudan, the UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) said there has also been a “significant increase in Sudanese refugees in the past few days.” MSF said a 27-year-old man had told staff at its hospital in Adré, Chad, that he fled El Geneina with 16 other people, but their group was attacked on the road to Chad. He said the attackers killed everyone, but he survived by playing dead. “Eventually a new group of refugees arrived and helped him reach the border. He has multiple bullet wounds on his hands and legs,” the MSF news release said. The incidents described to aid agencies follow a pattern of similar alleged abuses by the RSF since the conflict began, according to multiple CNN reports. “In the first three days of November, we have seen more new arrivals of Sudanese refugees than during the whole previous month; about 7,000 people crossed the border,” MSF outreach coordinator, Stephanie Hoffmann, said. UN refugee agency (UNHCR) director of external relations Dominique Hyde said she witnessed a surge in human suffering when she visited Sudan last week. In the Darfur region, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF has caused even more displacement with thousands struggling to find shelter and many sleeping under trees by the roadside, a UNCHR news release said. “Child malnutrition is rampant, women are being raped, violence prevails and entire families are sleeping outside with no roof over their heads,” Hyde wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Since the war in Sudan broke out in April, 4.5 million people have been internally displaced and an estimated 1.2 million have fled to neighbouring countries, according to UNHCR. On November 7, the US State Department announced that during talks in Jeddah, the SAF and RSF “committed to take steps to facilitate increased humanitarian assistance, and to implement confidence-building measures.” They were unable to agree on a ceasefire implementation. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, IGAD, also on behalf of the African Union, and the United States call upon the SAF and RSF to put the Sudanese people first, silence the guns, and seek a negotiated end to this needless war,” a joint statement from the talks released by the State Department said. They came after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called for an “immediate cessation of attacks” in El Fasher in North Darfur. “The United States is deeply troubled by reports of an imminent large-scale attack by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on El Fasher, North Darfur, that would subject civilians, including hundreds of thousands of displaced persons – many of whom only recently fled to El Fasher from other areas – to extreme danger,” Blinken said in a press statement on November 2. CNN’s Sarah Dean and David McKenzie reported from South Africa and Allegra Goodwin from London.",World
Mass visa cancellations at Saudi airport puts relations with Nigeria in spotlight," Diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have come under scrutiny after 177 Nigerians were refused entry to the country on Monday. Nigeria’s foreign ministry said only 87 of 264 Nigerian nationals who landed in Jeddah on an Air Peace flight Monday were allowed to enter. All the others had their visas cancelled and were deported. According to local media reports, some of the passengers were pilgrims hoping to perform the lesser Hajj (the Umrah) in Mecca, the Islamic holy city. The mass cancellation of visas occurred as Nigera’s President Bola Tinubu was still in Saudi Arabia after holding bilateral talks with the Saudi government. After a furor on social media, the Saudi embassy in Nigeria said that the affected passengers “didn’t fulfill the entry conditions and requirements in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Kingdom, as they submitted incorrect information to obtain a category of visa that doesn’t apply to them, which was discovered upon their arrival.” Saudi Arabia requires pilgrims to hold specific travel documents (Umrah or Hajj visas) for pilgrimage. Holders of tourist visas are barred from performing Hajj or Umrah during the Hajj season, according to regulations by the country’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah. It’s not immediately clear what type of visas the deported Nigerians had traveled with. However, Air Peace, the Nigerian carrier that flew the Nigerians into Jeddah said it was “shocked” that the visas of its passengers were revoked by Saudi Arabia on arrival because it “strictly followed the profiling procedures stipulated by Saudi Arabian authorities.” “The visas of all the passengers on the said flight to Jeddah … were checked and verified through the requisite procedures and were vetted to be valid before departure,” the airline said in a statement Wednesday, adding that: “No notice of cancelation or any form of denial from the Saudi authorities was received against any of these passengers despite the live transmission of their details.” The Saudi statement added the cancellations were not limited to Nigerian citizens, adding that: “… all passengers should review all the documents to determine their conformity with the conditions prior to departing from their countries to the Kingdom.” Commentators said the incident was embarrassing for Nigeria as its president was still in the country after attending the Saudi-Africa Summit held last Friday. He left Thursday morning for Guinea Bissau for Independence Day celebrations, the presidency said. “This is obviously a very big diplomatic slap in the face,” Victor Okhai, an advisory board member of the African Diaspora Foundation, a group that advocates the welfare of the African diaspora, told CNN. “There was a total lack of sensitivity (by Saudi officials) because the president (of Nigeria) was visiting that country,” Okhai said. A former Nigerian presidential aide, Reno Omokiri, said Saudi Arabia’s action was “embarrassing” as well as a blight on bilateral relations between both countries. “Why would the Saudis revoke the visas of over a hundred passengers on an Air Peace flight to Jeddah, especially as Nigeria’s President is currently in Saudi Arabia? That does not augur well for bilateral relations. It is most embarrassing … (and) demonstrates disdain for Nigeria as a whole,” Omokri posted on X, formerly known as Twitter earlier in the week. Other Nigerians called for the Saudi ambassador to the country to be summoned. Nigerians have also faced visa entry issues in other countries in the region. Saudi’s neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, has yet to lift a year-long visa ban on Nigerian travelers despite interventions by Tinubu. Tinubu’s office released a statement announcing the end of the ban shortly after his meeting with UAE leader Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in September. However, a UAE official told CNN the embargo was yet to be lifted. Saudi Arabia is a popular pilgrimage destination for thousands of Nigerian Muslims. However, Monday’s deportation of Nigerian nationals is not the first time travelers have been refused entry to Saudi Arabia. In 2012, authorities deported more than 1,000 female pilgrims from Nigeria because they were unaccompanied by male chaperones when they arrived in the country. Nigeria’s government says it is working to avoid a recurrence. “Notwithstanding the fact that it is the prerogative of a sovereign nation to determine who is permitted entry into its territory, Nigeria and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are traditional and strategic partners, who are willing to guard against reoccurrence of this unfortunate incident,” its foreign ministry said.",World
"As Argentina heads to the polls, will a plan to ditch the peso for the dollar be a vote-winner?"," When voters go to the polls this Sunday to elect Argentina’s next president, they will have to choose not only between two candidates, but between two opposite ideas of what type of country they want to live in. That is an old adage in the era of identity politics. Still, it is hardly truer anywhere than in Buenos Aires, where Sergio Massa, the country’s current finance minister and a scion of the political establishment, is squaring off against Javier Milei, a former television pundit who entered politics less than 36 months ago. The runoff between Massa, from the government coalition Union por la Patria (Union for the Homeland), and Milei of La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances), brings to an end a polarizing political campaign that has seen a series of surprising reversals, beginning in August when Milei stunned the country with a victory in a preliminary vote. After a weaker showing in the election’s first round in October, Milei was seen as being on the backfoot; this week he is once again leading in the polls. One of the biggest questions now facing voters in this soccer-obsessed nation is: which of these two political polar opposites, both of whom played as goalkeepers in their youth, is the safest pair of hands for an economy currently suffering some of the highest inflation in the world? More than 35 million Argentinians will be asked to cast their vote on Sunday on whether they trust Massa to lead the country out of its worst economic crisis of the past two decades through familiar policies that have failed before, or to dive into the unknown with Milei who proposes the radical idea of ditching the Argentinian peso in favor of the US dollar as national currency. Argentine law prohibits the publication of opinion polls up to eight days ahead of the vote, but recent results from the past few weeks have shown the candidates almost neck-and-neck, and most analysts believe the election will be close. On a personal level, the two candidates could not be more different: Massa is a family man who has dreamt of becoming a politician since he was 11 years old and has spent his career in and out of elected office; Milei lives alone with five English mastiffs – all genetically identical clones from a previous pet – and was elected to Congress in 2021. Massa has carefully selected his political alliances to propel his ascent to government, while Milei rose to fame with political stunts, like wielding a chainsaw at rallies, and vowing to unleash a wrecking ball on the administrative class his opponent represents. It is Milei who has attracted the most attention this year, not only because of his political style – on top of wielding chainsaws, he’s prone to raging outbursts and has embraced the nickname of ‘The Crazy One’ since climbing in the polls – but also because his proposed reforms would decisively shift Argentina to the right. Outside of his controversial plan for dollarization, his political program includes slashing regulations on gun control and transferring authority over the penitentiary system from civilians to the military; both measures part of a tough-on-crime approach. Milei proposes using public funds to support families who choose to educate their children privately – as a child he attended a Catholic private school in Buenos Aires – and privatizing the health sector, which in Argentina has always been in public hands in Argentina. In recent weeks, Milei triggered an uproar when it appeared he was in favor of opening a market for organ transplants, although he later retracted his declarations. He was similarly forced to apologize after calling Pope Francis, who is from Argentina and is seen as an icon of progressive politics in South America, “an envoy of Satan” in 2017. The apology, however, did not stop him from accusing Francis of siding with “bloodthirsty dictators” in an interview with right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson in September. At university, Milei studied economics and idolized Milton Friedman, to the point of naming one of his beloved dogs after the free-market theorist. But his most controversial proposal concerns public finances, as he plans to drastically cut government spending and, famously, eliminate the central bank and completely dollarize the country. The idea to dollarize is not new – two other nations in Latin America, Ecuador and El Salvador, have dollarized in the past 30 years to combat inflation – but it’s untested in a country as big as Argentina. Milei’s pitch is simple: Argentina’s rate of inflation, regularly among the highest in the world, is caused by politicians and central bankers who print new pesos to finance their social programs and electoral promises. As a result, the peso loses value, and everyone gets poorer. To fix the problem, Argentina should abandon the peso and adopt the dollar, whose value is set by the US Federal Reserve and cannot be printed at will. The downside of dollarization is that a nation loses the power to influence the economy through monetary policy. For that reason critics of dollarization often refer to it as a straightjacket. Because Argentina’s inflation rate is so high – just this week new data revealed prices had risen 142% from 2023 – the proposal has attracted interest from foreign institutions as well. In recent months, for example, The Economist, a conservative international publication, warned against the allure of dollarization, arguing that Argentina does not possess enough dollars to finance the currency switch and that the downsides would far outweigh the benefits. Conversely, analysts from the Cato Institute, a US-based rightwing economics think tank, favor the move as the only viable strategy to tame what is a decades-long problem. In the early 1990s the Argentinian peso was ‘pegged’ to the dollar, which meant its value was fixed to the US currency, but Argentinians would still use pesos for their shopping. Inflation came roaring back once the currency was allowed to float. Massa has criticized the plan for dollarization as a surrender of national sovereignty and attempted to show that the government’s current actions are already paying dividends. While still high – 142% year on year – , inflation in October was 35% lower than in September. Other mainstream politicians, including former the President Mauricio Macri and another former election candidate, Patricia Bullrich, have endorsed Milei despite sharing some reservations on dollarization. Interest in this Sunday’s elections goes far beyond Argentina’s borders. Abandoning a tradition of non-intervention in another country’s elections, leftwing politicians in the region including Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Colombia’s Gustavo Petro and Spain’s José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero have endorsed Massa. Milei meanwhile can count on the support of Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro, Peruvian-Spanish writer Mario Vargas Llosa and Spanish conservative former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The stakes are high because a victory for Milei could be seen as a boost for far-right populist politicians like Bolsonaro and former US President Donald Trump just ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, while a win by Massa would be a showcase for center-left policies. Polls close at 6 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET) and the vote count is expected to be quick – barring any unforeseen problems or objections, that is. Milei appeared to question the results of the first round of voting in October, although his party did not formally appeal.",World
Mexico’s first openly non-binary magistrate and prominent LGBTQ activist found dead," Mexico’s first openly non-binary magistrate and prominent LGBTQ activist Jesús Ociel Baena Saucedo was found dead at home in the central state of Aguascalientes on Monday. A second person, who was identified as Baena’s romantic partner, was also found dead in the home where they both resided, according to authorities in Aguascalientes, the state nearly 500 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of the capital city. Mexico’s Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodríguez said the cause of death is so far unknown, while Aguascalientes’ Attorney General Jesús Figueroa said there is no evidence of foul play for the moment. “The investigation is going to be done,” Rodríguez said during President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s daily press conference, also on Monday. The prosecutor’s office said that preliminary findings indicate that no traces of blood were found outside the crime scene, that there was no damage found in the accessways to the home, and that they are ruling out the “presence of a third person” involved in the deaths. The office added that “one of the lifeless bodies found was holding a cutting instrument.” Figueroa said the case would be investigated from a gender perspective because Baena identified as a non-binary person, though there was no mention of the deaths being potentially linked to a hate crime. For a little over a year, Baena was a member of the central Mexican state of Aguascalientes’ Electoral Tribunal. Baena told CNN en Español in October last year that there was no record in Latin America of a non-binary magistrate. Baena said that being the first was an achievement and recognition for years of work in favor of LGBTQ rights. “I want to send the message that the LGBTQ population can access these spaces, that there is a possibility, that we have people with enough of a profile that with their own merits can access these spaces where decisions are made,” Baena said at the time. While Latin America has made impressive progress on marriage equality over the decades, LGBTQ+ activists and gender minorities continue to suffer high levels of violence and discrimination from social and religious conservatives. Same-sex marriage was made legal across all 32 states of Mexico after Tamaulipas became the last state that voted to authorize such unions in 2022. Mexico’s Guadalajara city also co-hosted the Gay Games this month, alongside Hong Kong, marking a first for both continents to host the gender inclusive sporting event amidst opposition from conservative politicians.",World
Protests against copper mine deal turn deadly in Panama," Anti-mining protests that have roiled Panama for the last two weeks turned deadly on Tuesday when a man allegedly shot and killed two demonstrators, according to police. A chilling video posted by bystanders on X, formerly known as Twitter, showed a disheveled elderly man apparently frustrated with the logjam trying to force the protestors to remove a barrier blocking the Pan American highway about 50 miles south of the capital, before pulling out a pistol and opening fire. Panama’s National Police later said they arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of the shooting. The unusual scene of violence is the latest flashpoint in some of the largest protests to hit the Central American nation since Panamanians flooded the streets en masse to demonstrate against the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega in the 1980s. For weeks, tens of thousands of protestors have vented their fury at a controversial mining contract given to Minera Panama, the local subsidiary of a Canadian mining company, to extract copper, a key component in electric car batteries. The contract allows Canada’s First Quantum Minerals to restart an open-pit copper mine surrounded by rain forest for the next 20 years, with the possibility of extending for another 20 years. Environmentalists say the mine could contaminate drinking water and devastate tracts of the 32,000 acres the company negotiated use of, in exchange for yearly payments of $375 million. Panama’s government has promised, however, that the mine will bring thousands of jobs in addition to the badly needed revenue. First Quantum Minerals did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the protests. Opposition to the mine has united environmentalists, indigenous groups and teachers’ and construction unions who see allegations of backroom dealings between the government and the mining company as further evidence of widespread official corruption. The protestors accuse the government of selling off the nation’s natural resources at the same moment many Panamanians have been hit with the costs of rising inflation and are feeling the impacts of climate change. “Panamanians are suffering from lack of water, suffering from droughts, principally in the central provinces, animals that die, harvests that don’t happen,” environmental activist Martita Cornejo told CNN en Español. “The government did not guage the opposition from Panamanian society to a mining contract.” But former US ambassador to Panama John Feeley said while much of the outrage is real, the new contract announcement has also presented an opportunity for some groups to try to force their own concessions and win sweetheart deals from the government. “This is the horrible thing about Panama: Even when you protest corruption, you are probably facilitating it as well,” he said. Weeks of road blocks set up by protesters have shut down the country, preventing farmers from bringing crops to market and sequestering Panamanians in their homes. According to Panama’s association of company executives, the standstill inflicts $80 million in daily losses to local businesses. Celebrations to mark Panama’s independence from Colombia in 1903 were also widely cancelled last week. Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo has defended the mining deal after its announcement on October 20, saying the agreement would create jobs and revenue for Panama. The mine had provided a rare economic bright spot for Panama where tourism has been slow to recover from the pandemic and the drought has reduced traffic though the Panama Canal, which is expected to a cause a drop of revenue of $200 million in 2024. “We made the right decision, not the easiest one,” Cortizo said. “After a difficult and complicated negotiation for more than two years, a contract was agreed in 2023 between the company Minera Panama and the Panamanian State, which guarantees much better terms and conditions for the country.” But as the protests have dragged on, Panama’s government has offered concessions that have done little to deflate the crisis: Last week, congress passed a moratorium on all future metal mining and Cortizo called for a nationwide referendum in December on the controversial project. In 2017, Panama’s Supreme Court declared another contract to operate the copper mine as unconstitutional, forcing the mining company and government to renegotiate the deal. Opponents now say they are hopeful that an announcement by Panama’s Supreme Court this week that it is examining the legality of the contract could once again kill the deal. Whatever the resolution to the crisis, it may be too late to repair the damage done to Panama’s reputation in the region as a rare bastion of political and economic stability.",World
Pablo Escobar’s ‘cocaine hippos’ face Colombian government cull," Pablo Escobar’s notorious “cocaine hippos” are facing a cull, according to a statement from Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development Thursday. The herd, which the Colombian government said currently stands at 169 animals, has rapidly reproduced from the original population of one male and three females the drug kingpin owned as part of his private collection of exotic creatures. After Escobar’s death in 1993, authorities relocated most of the other animals in the collection, but not the hippos – because they were too difficult to transport. Free from any natural predator, the rising population poses an environmental challenge. If “strong measures” are not taken to control them, the population could boom to “1,000 individuals by 2035,” the statement said. This new phase to control the hippo population involves three strategies: sterilization, relocation and “ethical euthanasia,” it added. “All three strategies have to work together,” Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said in the statement. “Here we are in a race against time in terms of the permanent environmental and ecosystem impacts that are being generated and that is why we cannot say that only one strategy is effective for our objective, which is to control the population.” In 2021, scientists recommended culling the hippos to prevent long-term negative effects, but other scientists are calling instead for a castration program, citing concerns over animal welfare. Between 2011 and 2019, four males were castrated and two females were sterilized, but this did little to slow the hippos’ progress. Putting the hippos on birth control was similarly ineffective. There have also been plans to relocate some of the population to India, the Philippines and Mexico, with the logistics of sending 60 to India currently being analyzed, the statement said. “We are looking to implement this plan in the shortest possible time, precisely so that the impacts cease,” Muhamad explained. According to the ministry statement, sterilization will cost the country an average of 40 million pesos ($10,000) per animal, and will begin from next week, with an aim to sterilize 40 a year. The minister concluded by emphasizing that hippos have been declared an “invasive exotic” with “aggressive characteristics,” and that “their presence represents a threat to ecosystems and risks for the communities that surround them.” Research has shown negative effects of hippo waste on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can affect fish and ultimately humans. Hippos also pose a threat to agriculture and to the security of people in affected areas, according to a 2021 study. In April, a hippo descended from Escobar’s collection died after being hit by a car. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the rate at which the hippos will be sterilized.",World
Australian prime minister accuses Chinese navy of ‘dangerous’ conduct," Australia’s prime minister has accused the Chinese navy of “dangerous, unsafe and unprofessional” conduct after an incident in international waters near Japan, marking a potential friction point with Beijing weeks after he visited the Chinese capital to stabilize relations. Australian divers aboard the long-range frigate HMAS Toowoomba were trying to clear fishing nets from its propellers on November 14 when a Chinese destroyer approached, Australia’s Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a statement Saturday. Despite being warned that a diving operation was underway, the Chinese destroyer operated its sonar in a manner that “posed a risk to the safety of the Australian divers who were forced to exit the water,” the statement said. Medical assessments found the divers had sustained minor injuries, the statement added. In an interview with CNN affiliate Sky News Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was “very concerned” by the incident, adding that “one person suffered an injury as a result of the actions of China.” Albanese refused to confirm whether he raised the incident with Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they met at the APEC summit in San Fransisco last Thursday. “I can assure you that we raised these issues in the appropriate way and very clearly, unequivocally. And China, there’s no misunderstanding as to Australia’s view on this,” he said. China’s Defense Ministry on Monday dismissed Australia’s accusations as “completely inconsistent with the facts.” Wu Qian, a ministry spokesperson, said the Chinese destroyer, Ningbo, had been tracking and monitoring the Australian frigate in accordance with international laws and regulations. “The Chinese ship maintained a safe distance from the Australian ship and didn’t engage in any activities that might affect the Australian diving operations,” Wu said in a statement. “We urge Australia to respect the facts, stop making reckless and irresponsible accusations against China, and do more things that are conducive to enhancing the accumulation of mutual trust between two sides.” Asked about the incident at a regular news briefing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: “We hope relevant parties can stop causing troubles at China’s doorstep and work with China to jointly safeguard the momentum of improving China-Australia relations.” The incident took place a week after Albanese paid a landmark visit to Beijing – the first trip by an Australian leader in seven years – to stabilize rocky bilateral ties after years of economic tension. In the Sky News interview, Albanese sidestepped a question on whether the incident will make bilateral relations “look shaky” now. “Well, what I said when I was in China is that we will cooperate where we can but disagree where we must. And this is one of those times where we disagree with the action of China,” Albanese said. “We’ve made it clear that we disagree with what occurred, that we have the strongest possible objection, and that this sort of event should not occur.” In his statement Saturday, Marles said the Australian government had expressed “serious concerns” to the Chinese government over what it called an “unsafe and unprofessional” interaction with a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) destroyer. Medical assessments found the divers had sustained minor injuries, “likely due to being subjected to the sonar pulses from the Chinese destroyer,” the statement said. Military ships use sonar to detect and locate objects in the water. Divers exposed to high levels of underwater sound can suffer from “dizziness, hearing damage or other injuries to other sensitive organs,” depending on the frequency and intensity of the sound, according to the London-based Diving Medical Advisory Committee. The HMAS Toowoomba had been in Japan’s exclusive economic zone conducting operations in support of United Nations sanctions enforcement and was enroute to commence a scheduled port visit to Japan, according to Marles’ statement. “Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner,” Marles said. “Defense has for decades undertaken maritime surveillance activities in the region and does so in accordance with international law, exercising the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace.” China’s navy and air forces have been accused of unsafe practices by US and Canadian militaries in multiple close encounters in the East and South China seas in recent months. Earlier this month, the Canadian military said a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of its helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea on October 29, an operation it said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft. In response, China blamed Canada for carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea. Ray Powell, director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University, said it will likely never be known if the order to use the sonar came from commanders in Beijing or at a lower level, maybe the Chinese destroyer captain himself. “Either is disturbing, as the former would indicate mendacity at very senior levels, while the latter would demonstrate a mendacious military culture,” said Powell, a former US Air Force officer. “Were the roles reversed, it seems clear to me that an Australian naval commander who did the same thing would be relieved of command, or worse. Yet nobody believes such action is even being considered by Beijing,” Powell said.",World
Civilians caught in the crossfire as fighting escalates between Myanmar military and armed group," Renewed hostilities between the Myanmar military and ethnic minority armed group the Arakan Army (AA) have spread to various townships in western Myanmar, including Pauktaw, where civilians have been caught in the crossfire as fighting escalates. A former member of parliament from Pauktaw township, who asked not to be identified due to safety concerns, told CNN on Saturday that he had lost contact with people from the town and did not know what is happening. “I left the town the day the fighting broke out. But there are elderly people, sick people and families with young children left as they could not make haste,” he said. “It’s raining and a storm is coming too. It’s a devastating situation. It breaks my heart to see people in such a situation.” Ongoing clashes between the Arakan Army and the military began in the Rathedaung township on November 13 and have since spread to the townships of Maungdaw, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, and Paletwa, according to a statement from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on Friday. The renewed fighting has displaced more than 26,000 people in the country’s western Rakhine state since Monday, according to UNOCHA. The two parties had previously established an informal ceasefire in November 2022, according to the UN, but fighting broke out after the Arakan Army reportedly attacked two border posts. In a statement released on Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the latest figures brought the total number of internally displaced people due to the conflict between the two sides to approximately 90,000. It added that there had been reports of military shelling in Arakan Army-controlled areas. Myanmar’s military had also conducted at least one operation backed by air and naval support, UNOCHA said. Myanmar military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said during a briefing Friday that the Myanmar army and police force had retaken the Pauktaw police station and that the town “was already under control” of the military. Most humanitarian activities have been suspended due to the resurgence of the conflict and “virtually all roads and waterways” between townships in Rakhine have been blocked, according to OCHA. Battles between the military and resistance groups have unfolded almost daily across Myanmar since army general Min Aung Hlaing seized power in February 2021, plunging the country into economic chaos and fresh civil war. Airstrikes and ground attacks on what the Myanmar military calls “terrorist” targets have been occurred regularly since 2021 and have killed thousands of civilians to date, including children, according to monitoring groups. Whole villages have been burned down by junta soldiers and schools, clinics and hospitals destroyed. The son of a man from Pauktow who was killed as a result of the latest hostilities, told CNN that his father had been “hit by pieces of artillery at a meditation center” after Myanmar’s State Administration Council (SAC) soldiers started shooting at him “constantly.” “I was told he was crying out of pain, I can’t imagine how he would be suffering in a pool of blood. The next morning, I got a call that he passed away at night,” the man said. U Nan Diya, Chaung Suak village’s abbot monk, told CNN that he had been assisting three fellow villagers – a father sick with heart disease, accompanied by his daughter and son-in-law. Despite the family reaching a hospital two days before hostilities resumed, they remained stranded in a house in Pauktaw after the town “turned into a war zone,” U Nan Diya said. The sick man’s daughter had attempted to look for a boat to return to their village but was arrested by soldiers on Friday, he added. U Nan Diya said the 60-year-old man with heart disease was getting worse without medication. “(His) family wants him at their home instead of letting him die at a stranger’s house but nobody can go out or use the water route because the military navy is stationed in the sea, shooting everyone they see,” he said. “The sick man can’t die peacefully.”",World
"Renewed fighting in Myanmar has displaced 26,000 people since Monday, UN says"," Renewed fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Arakan Army (AA) has displaced more than 26,000 people in the country’s western Rakhine state since Monday, according to the United Nations. In a statement Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the latest figures bring the total number of internally displaced people due to conflict between the two sides to approximately 90,000. Eleven deaths and more than 30 injuries have been reported since an informal ceasefire agreed a year ago broke on November 13, the statement read. More than 100 people have reportedly been detained by the MAF and five by the AA, it added. Battles between the military and resistance groups have unfolded almost daily across Myanmar since army general Min Aung Hlaing seized power in February 2021, plunging the country into economic chaos and fresh civil war. The most recent fighting began when the AA reportedly attacked two border posts near the Maungdaw township, which is near the border with Bangladesh. The two parties had previously established an informal ceasefire in November 2022, according to the UN body. It added that there have been reports of MAF shelling in AA-controlled areas and that the military had conducted at least one operation backed by air and naval support.

This conservationist lost his eye in a tiger attack — but he’s still fighting to protect the king of the jungle," In the Bardiya region of Nepal, near the western border with India, Bhadai Tharu grew up with tales of tigers. They were not common in the forests around his home. At the turn of the 20th century, more than 100,000 tigers roamed Asia. But by the time Tharu was growing up in the 1970s, the tiger population had dwindled to just 20% of its peak. It didn’t stop his parents from narrating stories about them when he was a child. Living in the forested region where tigers were king of the jungle, the big cats took on a kind of mythical quality, Tharu says: on the rare occasion one ventured into the village, it was taken as a sign of the gods’ displeasure. The villagers would set up a “Madhwa, a place of worship for tigers as deities,” a ritual that continues to this day, he says. As an adult, he became involved in forest conservation and was committed to protecting their habitat. So when a tiger attacked Tharu in 2004, causing him to lose an eye, he felt as if he was being punished. “I was furious with the tiger,” he says. “Inside, I was seething with anger, and I even felt the urge to return to the jungle and seek vengeance against the tiger.” But as time passed, Tharu says his anger faded. “I came to realize that the jungle is the tiger’s home, and it only attacked me out of fear that I might harm its habitat.” He recalls that on the day of his attack, there were around 100 to 150 community members in the forest collecting wood and grass, which he was overseeing as chairman of the community forests initiative. “People were dispersed throughout the forest, and the tiger found itself surrounded by humans, unable to find an escape route,” he says. “The tiger that attacked me felt scared. It could have killed me, but it just attacked and left.” Tharu recommitted himself to protecting Nepal’s tiger population — as well as preventing human-wildlife conflict in the region. Back in the 1980s, the land around Tharu’s village, Khata, was barren and deforested. But in 2001, the land was handed over to local communities, who rely on the forest for materials and sustenance, says Tharu. This area, known as the Khata corridor, links the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh, India, and Nepal’s Bardiya National Park. The forest grew from 115 hectares to 3,800 hectares, and in 2021 won the WWF’s Conservation Excellence Award. And as the forest was restored, the wildlife returned too, says Tharu — including tigers. Bardiya National Park and the Khata corridor are part of the Terai Arc Landscape, a 24,710 square kilometer area along the Nepal-India border that covers six protected areas including forests and wetlands. In 2010, Nepal set a goal to double the number of tigers from 121 to 250 — but it exceeded that target, tripling the population to 355, according to WWF. The Khata corridor has “significantly contributed to tiger conservation” in the region, in particular the crackdown on poaching, which has been “completely eradicated,” says Umesh Paudel, a researcher based at the Bardiya base of the Nepalese non-profit National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), one of several organizations that support the community forests initiative. “Typically, wildlife does not consider such corridors their permanent habitat,” says Paudel. Prior to the conservation efforts, tigers were rarely spotted by cameras in the corridor — but Paudel says that in the 2021 tiger census, it was found that four tigers were permanently living in the Khata corridor. Territorial in nature, tigers need up to 58 square miles to roam and constantly seek new habitats — and the corridor has allowed the population to move freely and flourish, says Paudel. While the growing tiger population is a great conservation success story, the region is now facing a new problem: escalating human-wildlife conflict. Tiger attacks like Tharu’s were a rare occurrence in 2004. But as the tiger population increases, these attacks are becoming more frequent, and since 2019, there have been at least 34 fatal attacks on people in the Banke and Bardiya National Parks alone, says Paudel. Around 6,000 communities live in the corridor, and a busy highway runs through the middle, creating more opportunities for conflict. The NTNC monitors the tigers with camera traps and identifies potentially problematic tigers. After an attack, a tiger will often revisit the site, says Paudel, allowing the team to profile the animal and analyze behavior patterns. “If we ascertain that these tigers are frequently involved in human casualties, we recommend their capture,” he says, adding this is carried out by a team comprising the Nepalese Army, the National Park office, and NTNC. In addition to tracking and monitoring the tigers, the NTNC also manages the local deer population — the tiger’s main prey — to ensure there is enough food, and that the correct areas of the park, away from villages, are most attractive for the deer to live in. “This practice helps in containing tigers within the national park, thereby minimizing conflicts within the community,” says Paudel. Similarly, the creation of artificial watering holes has also helped to disperse the tiger population and direct animals away from local communities. However, tiger population growth isn’t the only reason behind the increased human-wildlife conflict, says Paudel. “Our community members are encroaching upon wildlife habitats, venturing into the forests alone, and disturbing the natural habitat. As a result of this disturbance, they often encounter attacks from tigers.” It is easier to influence human behavior than change the tigers, says Paudel, and so NTNC also works on community outreach to educate and empower, and prevent attacks by installing infrastructure such as fences and shelters. “It is crucial to prioritize community development, to ensure that communities become advocates for tiger conservation,” Paudel adds. Even as human-animal conflicts increase, Tharu says the local communities are happy to see the tiger population flourish. As apex predators, tigers are a keystone species which means that they are essential to the forest ecosystem that the surrounding communities rely on for their homes, sustenance and livelihoods. “The tigers were once endangered, and now they are back. It is good news for us,” Tharu says. By teaching communities to take precautions, he hopes that attacks can be reduced too. “Every being has equal rights on the earth,” he says.",World
What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed," Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Awful weather. Holiday crunches. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled. It’s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time – or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not). A storm this week is snarling some Thanksgiving travel, which is expected to be the busiest in many years for air travel. Here’s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled. Days ahead of the now-infamous December 2022 bomb cyclone, many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee. When you know a major weather event is forecast, hop on those waiver offers quickly, said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms (that is seats and flights). As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there. “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Keyes. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.” Keyes told CNN Travel in an interview that you should sign up for airlines’ free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier’s app. You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That’s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up. Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country. Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do? Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk – and get ready to multitask while you’re in line. Fast is a key word here. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said. Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said. Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead. “Most US-based travelers aren’t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.” You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. “Scan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.” The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage. “Not all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn’t always easy,” it told CNN Travel in an email. “Airlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter are a great way to get in contact with an employee. If you do use Twitter to reach out, then it’s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor.” Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude. “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. They’ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. “Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.” He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.” Your agent can expedite things if you’ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you’ve been waiting. Be ready to explain what you want. If you’ve booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you’ll have to deal through them when there’s a cancellation. If the price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, “it makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies” when you booked via a third party. US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong. The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily. “The chances of getting a refund are high when it comes to canceled flights due to reasons other than weather. Airlines, however, will typically try to reroute passengers to other airlines first. If this is the case, we recommend calling the airline’s customer support line directly to explore all your options, instead of waiting in long lines for gate agents to help,” said Jeff Klee, the CEO of CheapAir.com, in an email. Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor. “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel. “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.” “If you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket, you are entitled to a cash refund, though that may not help you get to where you need to go,” Smith said. “As we all know, last-minute flights are very expensive.” What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city? “Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It’s not required by law,” Keyes said. They’re less likely to do it if it’s weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues. Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments. What you might get depends on the airline itself and the specific circumstances on why a flight was canceled. Get to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren’t likely to just be offered. Also, your credit card could be your friend in this situation. “The good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.” Smith said. “These travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight. Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries.” If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport. The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily. Stay safe. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous. Frustrating though it is to stay put, it’s always better to arrive late than not at all. Consider buying travel insurance, advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel. It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.” The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later. But keep it to the basics. “Airlines only pay for ‘reasonable’ expenses though, so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol, expensive meals or extravagant hotels. “ The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or “significant delay” and you choose not to travel. This is the policy regardless of the reason the airline cancels or delays the flight. However, what constitutes a “significant delay” remains open to interpretation. According to the DOT website, “it has not specifically defined what constitutes a ‘significant delay.’  Whether you are entitled to a refund depends on many factors – including the length of the delay, the length of the flight, and your particular circumstances. DOT determines whether you are entitled to a refund following a significant delay on a case-by-case basis.” Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said in an email to CNN Travel that flyers should try to avoid vouchers. “If travelers are denied boarding, they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher. If they do, they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation,” Pawliszyn said. “Of course, if the airline makes a compelling enough offer, they may prefer to take it.”",World
The best Christmas markets taking place around the world in 2023," There’s nothing quite like a festive market to bring out the Christmas spirit in people. While these events can be traced back to Vienna – the city’s first recorded December market was in 1298 – the tradition has spread across the world over the centuries. From Germany, to Switzerland, to Singapore, to New York, it’s difficult to find a coveted destination that doesn’t hold an impressive annual advent market. In fact, some have grown so popular, they’ve become tourist attractions in their own right. Here’s our rundown of some of the top Christmas markets that are taking place around the world this year. With reindeer rides, a giant Ferris wheel and a classic nativity scene to marvel at, Vienna’s magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically. Although there are around 20 Christmas markets in the Austrian capital to choose from, Wiener Christkindlmarkt, or Rathausplatz, is one of its oldest and most traditional events. Held in front of City Hall, the event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, also features a 150-square-meter children’s ice rink, while the famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a hot favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity. There are also plenty of stalls offering up tasty treats like Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch. Wiener Christkindlmarkt runs from November 10 to December 26. It’s hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland. Most Swiss towns are pretty much taken over by festive markets at this time of year and the atmosphere is incredible. But Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around. Separated into two different sections at Barfusserplatz and Munsterplatz, it’s made up of around over 150 fabulously decorated stalls selling Christmas spices, decorations and candles. Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Munsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star workshop and a festive train. Attendees can also take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for incredible views of the lights illuminating the old town, or sip on some mulled wine at the 13-meter high Christmas pyramid on Barfusserplatz. Basel Christmas Market opens on November 23 and is scheduled to run until December 23. One of Europe’s oldest Christmas markets, Strasbourg began back in 1570, but it’s evolved considerably since then. Spread over more than 10 locations, including a section of the UNESCO world heritage site of Grande Île, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling Christmas lights and festive ornaments. Drawing in over two million people a year, the festive market features hundreds of wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine. Place Kleber is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree on display. But visitors will be treated to countless magical sights while wandering through the city’s narrow alleyways and pretty squares. Strasbourg Christmas Market begins on November 24 and closes on December 24. Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market. One of Belgium’s biggest and most popular events, the annual extravaganza extends across the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons. A light and sound show, ice skating, and fairground rides are among the activities to enjoy, while visitors can also browse through about 200 or so chalets serving glühwein, Belgian beers and waffles and stare in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree erected in Grand Place. Brussels Winter Wonders will run from November 24 to December 31. To say the city of Prague goes all out at Christmas is something of an understatement. The Czech capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period. While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day. Old Town Square provides endless entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops, while Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats like klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine. The markets will be open from December 2 to January 6, 2024. Dating back to 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the feast day of Santa Llucia, which falls on December 13, to a three-week fair. Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four different sections. The first is nativity and figurines, where visitors can pick up nativity scene type decorations and figurines. Greenery and plants is packed with both natural and artificial trees and various types of plants. The crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while simbombes is designated for musical instruments. There are also many festive activities like storytelling, a Christmas parade, and the caga tio, an enormous pinata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick. Fira de Santa Llucia will be taking place from November 24 to December 23. There’s much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce’s Franciscan Basilica. Although this traditional fair is transported from Heidelberg, Germany to Florence every year, it’s a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many Italian treats, such as panforte, for sale. However, there’s certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies. Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that’s lit up ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8. I Mercati Natale begins on November 18 and runs to December 17. It’s easy to see why Zagreb was voted the “best Christmas market destination” in travel portal European Best Destinations’ online poll for three consecutive years. Made up of around 25 Christmas markets spread across the Croatian capital, Advent in Zagreb is a magical sight. Think live nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves. Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to “fooling around” (or “fuliranje”) where you’ll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment. Advent in Zagreb 2023 is scheduled to run from December 2 to January 7, 2024. Rumored to be the inspiration for Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year. But you’ll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period. With over 1,000 beautifully decorated Christmas trees adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it’s a winter experience like no other. The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia’s Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year’s Eve. Christmas in Tivoli is taking place from November 19 to December 31. (The park will be closed on December 24). The Estonian capital’s annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets. Set inside Tallinn’s Town Hall Square, it’s packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale. On the entertainment front, there are carousels, a winter grotto and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeer. Visitors are also treated to regular performances by dance troupes and choirs. But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn’s tree has been displayed here since 1441. Tallinn Christmas Market 2023 is due to take place from December 1 to January 7, 2024. Stockholm isn’t exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen. Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world’s oldest open-air museum, it’s a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic. The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner. Visitors can make their own decorations at Christmas workshops, take part in regular craft demonstrations or join in with the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen’s main site. Skansen’s Christmas Market is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 24 until December 17. This wonderfully Scandinavian Christmas market is held in Helsinki’s Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue. Tuomaan Markkinat’s centerpiece is a vintage carousel, but the countless vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies, glogi, Finland’s take on mulled wine, and handicrafts are also a big draw. Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities like Christmas cookie decorating. The market’s food court is particularly impressive, with a host of top eateries to choose from. Tuomaan Markkinat is set to run from December 1 to December 22. Budapest has two main festive markets – St. Stephen’s Basilica Christmas market, or Advent Bazilika, and Vorosmarty Square Christmas market. The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade. In addition, there are around 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts. Meanwhile, the Vorosmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts over 800,000 visitors annually. Its main highlight is usually a giant advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23, although the fantastic Hungarian foods that line its stalls – langos and chimney cake are also particular standouts. The markets will open on November 17 and close on January 1, 2024. Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets. Capital city Berlin has around 80 to choose from, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned. Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it’s a maze of wooden huts with Bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with unique Christmas gifts. At night, visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances. Over in Nuremberg, Bavaria’s second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century. During the Christmas period, around 200 stands are erected in the city’s central market square and the whole area is abuzz with activity. The market usually draws in around two million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg’s annual highlights. Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt 2023 kicks off on December 1 and ends on December 24. Gendarmenmarkt opens on November 27 and is set to close on December 31. Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is one of the most highly anticipated winter events in the UK capital. The festive favorite, which began in 2005, brings in huge crowds every year thanks to its 200-plus rides, including a 70-meter-high big wheel, mulled wine stations and an outdoor skating rink, which happens to be the largest in the UK. Visitors can also take part in ice sculpting workshops, watch a circus troupe, listen to live music at the lively Fire Pit bar, or tuck into some of the many foods on offer at the Street Food Village. Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is scheduled to open on November 17 and will continue until January 1, 2024 Stretched across a huge section of Rynek Glowny, the Polish city’s central square, Krakow Christmas Market is among the largest in Europe. Historic landmark St. Mary’s Basilica serves as a stunning backdrop to the yearly event, which has been around since the early 14th century, as does the Renaissance Cloth Hall. Revelers can tuck into Polish delicacies such as kiełbasa (sausage,) shop for handcrafted gifts or treats, while taking in live music from folk bands and carol singers. The market also hosts a nativity competition in which participants, including school children and local artists, create small nativity scenes, or cribs, which are displayed at the statue of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, situated in the square, before a winner is chosen. Krakow Christmas Market will be held from November 24 to January 1, 2024. Now in its 10th year, Singapore’s Christmas Wonderland is continuing to grow in popularity. Staged at the famous Gardens by the Bay nature park, the annual event, which lasts for around four weeks, covers more than 27,000 square meters and is separated into three areas – Supertree Grove, Frosty’s Fairground at The Meadow, and Gingerbread Grove – all packed with attractions. From fairground rides, to a Christmas train, to light and sound shows, to carnival games, to a life-sized gingerbread house lit up by candy canes, to live performances, there’s plenty of activities to choose from. The 20-meter tall Spalliera, a magnificent design inspired by Mesola Castle in north Italy is one of the main highlights, along with the stunning Walk of Lights, which is illuminated by around 75,000 bulbs. Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay opens on December 1 and closes on January 1, 2024 Formerly known as the Toronto Christmas Market, the Distillery Winter Village is an intimate and charming take on the traditional European festive market. Held in the historic Distillery District, it features outdoor shopping cabins and food vendors, Christmas carol sing-a-longs, a gingerbread hunt and a 50-foot Christmas tree. Visitors will be able to find everything from artisanal food, handcrafted gifts and festive drinks at the numerous stalls here. The Distillery Winter Village 2023 will be open daily (other than December 25) from November 16 to the New Year. Each and every year, Manhattan’s Bryant Park is transformed into a magnificent wonderland for the Winter Village. The renowned open-air market is a wonderful sight to behold, with over 150 custom-designed kiosks and a 17,000-square-foot outdoor rink that’s free to use provided you have your own skates. Its rinkside bar and food hall The Lodge provides an eclectic mix of eateries, along with an outdoor beer garden and a cocktail bar. Outside the Winter Village, the Josephine Shaw Lowell Fountain is at its most beautiful during winter time, when it regularly freezes over. The Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Park opened on October 27 and is scheduled to run until March 3, 2024. First launched in 1996, Christkindlmarket Chicago takes inspiration from the historic Christkindelmarkt in Nuremberg, Germany, bringing a taste of traditional German Christmas markets to the ‘Windy City’. Now staged across three locations around Chicago, Daley Plaza, Gallagher Way at Wrigley Field and RiverEdge Park in Aurora, the hugely popular market provides live entertainment alongside a multitude of stalls selling everything from bratwurst and hot spiced wine, to hand-crafted ornaments. Admission is free, but those attending the Daley Plaza market who are keen to skip the crowds have the option to purchase a $25 fast-entry pass on weekends. Christkindlmarket Chicago runs from November 17 to December 24. Information correct at the time of publishing.",World
First-ever World of Frozen opens at Hong Kong Disneyland," Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Sven have a new home on a subtropical island in Asia. World of Frozen, Disney’s first-ever themed land dedicated to the “Frozen” media franchise, opened at Hong Kong Disneyland on November 20. The new land at the park on Hong Kong’s Lantau Island brings the fictional kingdom of Arendelle to life, including several elements from key scenes in the hit movies such as the North Mountain, Elsa’s Ice Palace, the snowflake-topped ice fountain and the clock tower where Anna and Prince Hans sing “Love is An Open Door” in the first “Frozen” movie. “The ‘Frozen’ franchise is one of the most successful in Disney history and it’s a testament to the power of great storytelling,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in Hong Kong at a November 16 event to commemorate World of Frozen’s opening. Disney Imagineers spent more than three years working on the concept and design of the new attraction. The franchise itself is just 10 years old, with the first “Frozen” movie coming out in 2013, followed by “Frozen II” in 2019, as well as several short films and TV shows. The company announced in September that it will be doubling its investment in its Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment, with $60 billion spending planned in the next decade. While Disney is facing revenue challenges elsewhere, its international theme parks are thriving, with Iger saying in August that parks in Asia are doing “exceptionally well.” In the new World of Frozen in Hong Kong, cast members playing Elsa, Anna and Kristoff will walk around interacting with guests, a departure from other lands where princesses and other characters are largely available only for photo opportunities. And instead of scheduled shows, a band will wander intermittently throughout World of Frozen playing music. Hong Kong’s World of Frozen also includes two rides: Wandering Oaken’s Sliding Sleighs, a high-speed roller coaster that gives guests views of the Arendelle castle, and Frozen Ever After, a boat ride featuring Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Marshmallow, Sven the reindeer, Olaf the snowman and Pabbie Troll. As visitors float through Frozen Ever After, characters sing songs from the movies, including “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?,” “Let It Go,” and “For the First Time in Forever,” recorded by the movie’s original English-language cast. Michael Moriarty, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland, called World of Frozen “the most immersive attraction we’ve ever built.” He added that the decision to bring World of Frozen to Hong Kong was influenced by the regional interest in the franchise and the unique natural elements of Lantau Island, where Hong Kong Disneyland is located. “I think also when you look at the beautiful space that we have, with our ability to create mountains that wind together with the Lantau mountains and the scenery, to create a very specific and unique immersive environment, I think it was an easy decision that Hong Kong should be the first,” Moriarty told reporters ahead of the opening. Asked how the team chose which scenes and elements to feature, Moriarty said, “when you think about the scenes that really connect you with Anna and Elsa and Kristoff and Sven, we tried to recreate those.” “What we have created here with the World of Frozen is this wonderfully immersive experience where you are at the center of the story,” Moriarty said. In pursuit of a more immersive experience, architecture and design elements in World of Frozen are inspired by Norway, just as Arendelle was in the movies. Visitors can see the 19th-century Dragestil (Norwegian for “dragon style”)-inspired architecture in the storefronts located throughout World of Frozen, and the stylized floral motifs indicative of rosemaling decorative art featured on the clothing worn by cast members. The menu at World of Frozen’s Golden Crocus Inn also draws from Norwegian cuisine and includes a Bayside Seafood Medley in a nod to the harborside location of both Arendelle and the World of Frozen. At night, World of Frozen is alight with Elsa’s “Ice Magic” as the Ice Palace, Arendelle Castle and Friendship Fountain light up an icy blue. Hong Kong’s climate, however, is very different from Norway’s. Snowfall is virtually unheard of here and while November is late autumn in Hong Kong, average temperatures still hit around 75 F (24 C). A ticket to Hong Kong’s Disneyland includes admission to the World of Frozen, though in honor of the new land, the park has introduced a series of four new “Frozen” themed ticket designs showcasing Anna, Elsa, Kristoff and Olaf. Visitors can get to Hong Kong Disneyland by car or via the orange line on Hong Kong’s MTR public transit system. Disney has its own train from Hong Kong’s Sunny Bay station, which is plastered in World of Frozen decals to commemorate the world’s opening.",World
American Airlines reviewing viral video showing wheelchair crashing onto airport tarmac," American Airlines said it is reviewing a video posted on TikTok that shows a baggage handler releasing a passenger’s wheelchair to slide down a jet bridge chute, where it crashed into a metal barrier, flipped over and tumbled onto an airport tarmac. The post, which has millions of views, has brought renewed attention to the traveling plight of millions of disabled Americans. According to the Paralyzed Veterans of America nonprofit, more than 31 wheelchairs were damaged, delayed or lost each day by airline workers between 2019 and 2022. The user who posted the TikTok video, Haeley Dyrdahl, said she recorded the incident Sunday at Miami International Airport “after I saw them do this and laugh with the first two wheelchairs.” She told CNN she also saw a suitcase get the same treatment. In the video, as the first man lets the wheelchair go, a second baggage handler, who is on the ground at the other end of the chute and wearing an American Airlines vest, steps back. The wheelchair slides down, strikes the barrier and flips over. The handler then loads the wheelchair onto a baggage cart. It’s unclear if the wheelchair was damaged. For those who use wheelchairs, arriving at an airport only to learn an essential tool for mobility has been damaged can be a real nightmare. Dyrdahl told CNN she often works with wheelchair users through her job and has had many families “express concerns with how their wheelchair would be handled during travel.” “After seeing this happen firsthand a couple times in a row, I was very sad to learn just how valid their concerns are,” she said. American Airlines said in a statement, “We recognize how important it is to support the independence of customers with disabilities by ensuring the proper care of mobility devices throughout their journey with us. This visual is deeply concerning and we are gathering more details so that we can address them with our team. We will continue to work hard to improve our handling of assistive devices across our network.” The airline said it is working to improve training for employees handling mobility devices and installing wheelchair movers and lifts at airports with high mobility device traffic, which will help lower the risk of damage. It did not provide a timeline. In a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the incident was “totally unacceptable” and the department, which has published a bill of rights for disabled passengers, would investigate. In August 2023, American Airlines mishandled 226 wheelchairs and scooters – a rate of 2.24 per 100 they handled on planes, according to the most recent available data released by the Department of Transportation. Among 15 major US carriers, it ranked 13th, according to the data. The data is trending in the wrong direction for the airline. In 2022, American Airlines’ rate of damaging, delaying or losing wheelchairs and scooters was 2.00 per 100, DOT statistics show. In September, the DOT announced United Airlines would “roll out a flight filter on its booking engine to make it easier for passengers who use wheelchairs to find flights where their wheelchairs can fit and be safely transported” as part of an agreement with the department. The DOT also said it was laying the groundwork for a potential policy that would give passengers the ability to stay in their wheelchairs on flights. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who uses a wheelchair, called the video “shocking, but not surprising based on my own travel experiences or those of anyone who relies on a mobility device to live their lives fully.” “Since I passed a law requiring public disclosure of how often airlines damage mobility devices, data shows that far too many wheelchair users land at their destinations only to find their wheelchairs broken, often irreparably,” Duckworth said in a statement. “It’s completely unacceptable to treat critical medical devices like this.” In 2018, Duckworth authored the bill that requires the DOT to issue monthly reports on damage to wheelchairs and scooters, and she is continuing to work on federal legislation to improve travel for disabled passengers. In September, Duckworth and Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, introduced the Mobility Aids on Board Improve Lives and Empower All (MOBILE) Act to address challenges faced by passengers who use mobility aids. “Though DOT is currently required to report the number of wheelchairs damaged each month, it does not evaluate data on the frequency or types of damage to manual wheelchairs, power wheelchairs or scooters,” the statement from Duckworth and Thune -– both members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee -– said. The legislation would require the Secretary of Transportation to notify air carriers of proposed rulemaking that would require them to publish dimensions of cargo holds. It also calls on the agency to study whether it is possible for passengers to use wheelchairs in the main cabin. It also says, “If in-flight, in-wheelchair seating is determined to be technically feasible, (the secretary should) assess the economic and financial feasibility of accommodating passengers with their wheelchairs in the main cabin during flight.” Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, and Rep. Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican, introduced a similar bill in the House.

The history of Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade: 5 facts you may not know," As far as holiday traditions go, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is about as essential to the cozy November holiday as turkey and stuffing. While it’s had some interruptions and mishaps along the way, the show has still managed to go on almost every year for nearly a century. Let’s look back at five historical facts about the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade: The original store was about 20 blocks south on Sixth Avenue near 14th Street. Macy’s has been at its current flagship location, at Broadway and 34th Street, since 1902. Continuing expansion made the location what Macy’s called the “world’s largest store,” an entire city block with more than 1 million square feet of retail space. In celebration, employees organized a Christmas parade in 1924 featuring “floats, bands, animals from the zoo and 10,000 onlookers,” according to a Macy’s history page. It also started way up at 145th Street. The parade concluded with Santa Claus and the unveiling of the store’s Christmas windows. Three years later, the Christmas Parade was renamed the Thanksgiving Day Parade. Macy’s didn’t invent the practice. Philadelphia has the oldest Thanksgiving Day parade: Its Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade, now the 6ABC - Dunkin’ Thanksgiving Day Parade, debuted in 1920. You had to use your visual imagination when the first broadcasts of the parade took place in 1932 – that’s because they were on the radio. The parade was first televised in 1946 in New York and then nationally on NBC the next year. According to Mental Floss, the balloon attractions debuted in 1927, inspired by a balloon float. Even then, they were massive – one was a 60-foot dinosaur – and, in those days, they had more to deal with than just high winds and crazy weather: Until 1938, an elevated train ran down Sixth Avenue. Well-known characters have been part of the parade since that 1927 outing. Felix the Cat was there from the beginning, and Mickey Mouse joined in 1934, the same year that featured a balloon based on popular entertainer Eddie Cantor. “Peanuts” characters, especially Snoopy – who made his first appearance in 1968 – are regular visitors. One tradition didn’t last long. The balloons were originally allowed to float away, and those who found them got a gift certificate from Macy’s. For years, the parade’s Midtown route went right down Broadway, Manhattan’s spine. But in 2009, the route was moved to Seventh Avenue because of new pedestrian plazas along Broadway. It was changed to Sixth Avenue in 2011. Given the parade’s draw as a tourist attraction, this did not go over well with some folks. For 2019, the route started at 77th Street and Central Park West, where it took a left turn at 59th Street. It continued to ride past Central Park until it reached Sixth Avenue. From there, it headed down to 34th Street, where it hung a right and ended at the flagship store. And because of the pandemic, 2020 saw a very shortened only-for-TV route near the flagship store. You can check out the 2.5-mile route for 2023 on Macy’s website. In 1957, a wet day got wetter for people near a Popeye balloon: The character’s hat filled with water and drenched parade watchers. The same thing happened in 1962 with a Donald Duck hat. Superman once lost his arm to tree branches. But the worst was probably 1997, a blustery day in the Big Apple. During that parade, winds reached more than 40 miles per hour, and the balloons were difficult to control. One balloon struck a lamppost and injured four people; one woman was in a coma for a month. The Pink Panther threatened a woman holding its ropes. “The balloon was caught on top of me and my daughter,” she told The New York Times. “We thought it was going to smother us.”",World
Look of the week: Emily Ratajkowski and the ultra-cinched puffer," In the not too distant past, the silhouette to beat was no silhouette at all. For many years fashion’s preference was slouchy and sloth-like — from ballooning wide leg pants to enveloping raglan coats. A-listers such as Justin Bieber, Bella Hadid and Zoe Kravitz helped keep the oversized fit firmly in vogue, whether it was Bieber’s two-sizes-too-big Balenciaga suit at the 2022 Grammys or the billowing wool overcoats Kravtiz is often seen wearing out in New York. But while the boxy cut remains, this year a counter trend has emerged. Suddenly, it seems there is no body part more important than the waist. Almost overnight, eliminating this crucial curve through straight-cut clothes has become sacrilegious. Enter the built-in belt: designed to cinch and snatch the midriff of any garment it’s embedded within. Yesterday, Emily Ratajkowski — who has been a pioneer of the style for a number of years — was seen walking her dog in a tightly belted puffer jacket. She paired her coat, unnaturally contorted into an hourglass shape, with black yoga pants and chunky gold hoops. Harper’s Bazaar cited the cinching trend as “a styling trick we should all be adopting.” On Monday, Jennifer Lawrence went viral for belting her black wool Dior coat at the Saks Fifth Avenue Christmas light switch-on. Or rather, Lawrence went viral for the belt springing off her body mid-speech. Never one to be thrown through a loop, the “Hunger Games” actor persisted after a quick acknowledgement: “I’m so sorry, that was so loud, my belt popped off!” For those concerned about a repeat of Lawrence’s wardrobe malfunction, there is now an expansive offering of sewn-in cinching devices: on Proenza Schouler’s Fall-Winter 2023 runway, Chloe Sevigny strutted in a white ‘70s collared shirt and black blazer dramatically tied at the waist with a leather rope. Danish designer Cecilie Bahnsen has reimagined the denim jacket with a V-shaped corset structure and gathered hip inserts. While every retailer from French Connection to The Frankie Shop are selling crisp white shirts with waist darts or fabric ties. For the more casual punters, independent London designer Dilara Findikoglu has just released T-shirts with integrated waspies — a head-spinning hybrid of cotton jersey up top and traditional boning on the bottom. Even fast fashion got the memo — more than 1,300 people have left reviews for a bodice-style zip-up hoodie on Cider.com. “Cute and comfy and snatches your waist,” wrote one reviewer. “It gives the perfect shape to your body and looks spectacular.” The sculpted hourglass shape has symbolized a particularly exaggerated version of femininity that has fascinated humanity for centuries — and while the look is fraught with ideas of disempowerment and female oppression, fashion has been slowly but surely reviving waist-centric designs over the last few years. From the Gen Z-approved range of corsets designed by LA-based label Miaou to the resurgence of low-rise jeans, showing off one’s middle has become top priority. Now, perhaps the final frontier is making sure we can wear our waists, á la Ratajkowski, even during a winter dog walk.",World
Remember when Angelina Jolie’s thigh-high slit dress kickstarted the ‘Angelina Effect’?," Remember when Angelina Jolie’s right leg became a viral sensation? It was 2012, and the actress arrived at the 84th Academy Awards in a strapless black velvet dress by Atelier Versace. But this was no ordinary gown: It bore a daring thigh slit — one so high that it artfully unveiled just about the entirety of Jolie’s right leg as she posed confidently for the cameras, one hand firmly planted on her hip. Jolie, then 36, was already a red-carpet fixture. But the moment catapulted her into the viral stratosphere, sparking media fanfare, a string of memes and even social media accounts dedicated entirely to “the right leg.” It wasn’t just her thigh that stole the spotlight that evening, though. Amid the sea of pristine white gowns worn by fellow attendees like Gwyneth Paltrow and Milla Jovovich, Jolie stood out in black. It was a striking departure from the icy palette that prevailed at that year’s Oscars — ironic, given that she’d helped spark the trend by wearing a sumptuous satin white satin Versace creation to the Golden Globes a month earlier. In the room, Jolie’s on-stage leg reveal — while presenting the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay — was well-received, prompting imitations by the award’s winners Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (for “The Descendants”). Rash told reporters backstage that it was not a mockery but a “loving tribute.” Jolie’s Oscars gown was praised widely in the fashion press, with The New Yorker’s Judith Thurman crowning her as the evening’s “best-dressed” for baring her “to die for” legs and Harper’s Bazaar’s Joyann King commending how the actress “embraced her sultry side.” Vogue’s late editor-at-large André Leon Talley, meanwhile, celebrated how she made black velvet “super-sexy with a huge slash, totally eighties Versace style.” But not all critics were on board. The leggy look was described as “boring” in TIME magazine, which gave a score of “right leg: 1, black dress: 0.” An opinion piece published in Philadelphia Magazine described Jolie’s posing as “comical and pathetic,” saying she appeared “aloof, arrogant and snotty.” Her slender leg even sparked some uncomfortable and heated debated over the star’s weight among tabloids and TV pundits, with some observers suggesting that she appeared frail. (Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly described her, on air, as “emaciated.”) As for the court of public opinion? Views were also mixed. A parody Twitter account called @AngiesRightLeg, which has since been deleted, amassed over 34,000 followers in two days, according to Reuters, with posts including “Look at the leg!” and “You have to admit I’m one hell of a leg.” A Glamour magazine survey meanwhile found that around three-quarters of readers were “not into” Jolie’s “pose-y stance.” Jolie later said she hadn’t taken notice of the hype. “I heard something, but I didn’t pay any attention. It’s as simple as being a woman picking a dress you like and having a night, and not really thinking about anything else,” she told The Huffington Post the next month. Some years later, at the premiere of 2019’s “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” Jolie added that the dress had been chosen with comfort in mind. “I think when you feel comfortable, when you feel yourself — which is very much the theme of the film, and we know this in life — you embrace it,” she told Extra on the red carpet. The actress nonetheless managed to foreshadow a fall trend, with labels including Balmain, Azzaro and Jean Paul Gaultier bringing thigh-high slits to their runways less than a month after the Oscars. Other stars, from Chrissy Teigen and Beyoncé to Jennifer Hudson and Nicole Scherzinger, also carried the mantle on that year’s red carpets — a proliferation of exposed thighs that The New York Times dubbed “The Angelina Effect” (a term later reappropriated to describe the spike in women with high risk of breast cancer seeking pre-emptive double mastectomies, a procedure Jolie underwent in 2013). In March of this year, Donatella Versace, the designer behind the dress, fondly reflected on her creation while recounting her favorite Oscars looks in The Wall Street Journal. “Sometimes you don’t know which dress is the best,” she said, “but when you see someone wearing the dress it can become fantastic.” Clearly, Angie was onto something and, as always, put her best foot — or leg — forward.",World
Animatronic model of E.T.’s head expected to fetch up to $1 million at auction," An animatronic head of E.T., the beloved alien left behind on Earth in Steven Spielberg’s classic movie, is expected to sell for as much as $1 million at an auction held on December 14-17 in Beverly Hills, California and online. The animatronic model from “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” is part of a sale organized by Julien’s Auctions and Turner Classic Movies, which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. More than 1,000 props and memorabilia from some of the best-known sci-fi, fantasy, action and superhero movies and TV series will be available at the auction. Designed by the late Carlo Rambaldi, the model has some incredibly expressive moves. Its nostrils open and close, and its veins pulsate, while cables also allow for the movement of its eyes, lips, eyebrows, forehead and tongue. This model comes from Rambaldi’s own collection, as did the animatronic figure of E.T. sold by Julien’s Auctions last November for $2.56 million. His daughter, Daniela Rambaldi, recalls her father finding inspiration for E.T.’s expressive blue eyes from their family cat “Kikka,” the auction house said. The story of the homesick E.T. and his bond with Elliott, the boy who finds him, Spielberg’s 1982 movie won near-universal acclaim and was nominated for nine Oscars, of which it won four. Other artifacts from movie history are also up for sale, including a full Batman costume worn by Michael Keaton in “Batman Returns,” which has an estimate of up to $70,000, and a model of The Robot from the 1960s sci-fi series “Lost in Space.” This model is “one of the rarest artifacts from the era ever offered at auction which also is still functional,” the auction house said, since only two full-scale models of The Robot were made during the show’s run. It is expected to be sold for up to $500,000. Several items of Harry Potter memorabilia are for sale, too, including robes and the half-moon glasses worn by Richard Harris playing Albus Dumbledore in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” The robes - screen-matched for authenticity - and glasses are anticipated to reach up to $70,000 and $20,000, respectively. And for Marvel fans, props such as Captain America’s shield, complete with battle scars, from “Captain America: The First Avenger,” and a helmet worn by Robert Downey Jr. playing Iron Man in “Captain America: Civil War” are expected to sell for up to $70,000 and up to $40,000, respectively.",World
The Iranian artist using painting to honor her lost homeland," Soheila Sokhanvari’s retrospective “We Could Be Heroes…” takes its name from David Bowie’s 1977 classic “Heroes,” a song which has particular resonance for the Iranian born, UK-based artist. Like the two lovers separated by the Berlin Wall in Bowie’s song, Sokhanvari was separated from everything she knew and loved by the 1979 Revolution. The experience inspired her vibrantly patterned miniature paintings which evoke a hazily remembered pre-revolutionary past where progressive and conservative values co-existed — albeit uneasily — and resurrects icons the Islamic Republic sought to destroy. Sokhanvari, now 59, arrived in the UK in 1978 as a 14-year-old to stay with family friends, having never been away from loved ones before. The plan was for her to be educated in the UK before returning to Iran, but then the revolution began. “Overnight I lost access to everyone I loved, my language, my culture, everything,” said Sokhanvari from her home in Cambridge via Zoom. She found consolation in a family photo album her mother had packed for her and began drawing from the images. “When I was drawing the people in the photos came alive and I could relive that moment again. It helped me cope with the longing for my family and my people,” she recalled. For as long as she can remember Sokhanvari had wanted to be an artist, but she initially trained as a research scientist to please her mother. However it was a profession from which she always felt alienated. “I felt like I was trespassing in the world of science,” she said. A serious cycling accident in 1997 was the catalyst for Sokhanvari to finally follow her dream. “I promised myself that if I regained my health I would become an artist. I didn’t want any regrets in my life,” she explained. In Sokhanvari’s early work, she used Iranian crude oil — the discovery of which in 1908 would lead to international intrigue, coups and violence — to create sepia-tinged drawings of family holidays and popular culture in pre-revolutionary Iran. The seemingly nostalgic pictures suggest that through our use of oil “we are all implicated in these histories. There isn’t a person on this planet who hasn’t used crude oil in some way. It’s in our clothes, in plastic, in paints,” said Sokhanvari. The images encourage us to acknowledge that the politics around its production and supply “comes with environmental, economic, and human cost,” she said. But it is her later miniatures for which she has become best known. Painted in egg tempera (pigment mixed with egg yolk) on a parchment made from calf vellum (calf skin) using a squirrel hair brush — a technique traditionally associated with Persian miniatures — each small painting takes Sokhanvari between six and 12 weeks to create, working a minimum of 12-hours a day. Her first major solo show, “Rebel Rebel”, which focused on her series of female performers silenced by the revolution, was warmly received by critics when it opened at the Barbican in London in 2022. Jackie Wullschläger in The Financial Times praised her “defiantly joyful art” while Jonathan Jones in The Guardian called it “ the opposite of instant art.” Sokhanvari’s initial inspiration for her miniatures was the family photographs which had consoled her throughout her childhood. “My father and mother were my muses, they were these characters that I built up a story around,” she said. Pre-revolution her father worked as a fashion designer and model and encouraged Sokhanvari’s beehive-wearing mother to embrace western fashions. However her grandmother was far more traditional. “In the same family you can have this chasm between people who embraced western ideologies and those who rejected them,” she recalled. The conflicted ideologies are addressed via the combination of western and Islamic patterns in her work. “I put the two together because these people are trying to negotiate the two opposing cultures,” she said. In “Conquest of the Garden” (2016) her mother can be seen sitting on a chintzy chair in a walled garden decorated in bold Islamic tiles. Fists rise up from the flowerbeds. It was in 2019 that Sokhavani began to focus on Iranian female performers such as  actress Kobra Saeedi, who could no longer work following the 1979 revolution. Banned from performing, singing or dancing in public, many other artists were also imprisoned and allegedly tortured. Any films they had appeared in were burned and their images destroyed as the new regime attempted to erase any evidence that they had ever existed. For Sokhanvari, who was only able to embrace her true vocation as an artist later in life, the desire to create their portraits was deeply personal. “I just thought of how I would feel if I were stopped from creating my art,” she said. Using online images, Sokhanvari resurrects these women in their prime, creating modern day martyr portraits of a generation of women whose lives were destroyed. Some are caught in dramatic poses, others recline comfortably on a sofa, but all are enveloped in a riot of pattern and color, as they call out across the decades to be remembered. Thanks to the UK-based Persian language TV channel Manoto — who interviewed Sokhanvari when “Rebel Rebel” was on — many Iranians now know that they have been. Although Sokhanvari doesn’t want to name names for fear of endangering them, she says that a number of her subjects contacted her via Instagram having seen the program via satellite in Iran. The portraits could never be shown in Iran (the only work Sokhnavari has ever shown there are drawings she mailed to an artist friend in 2015) but at least the women knew they existed. “They said that it felt like a Renaissance for them,” she said. “They were so grateful to have been given a platform.” The Emmy Award-winning actor Shohreh Aghdashloo, one of Sokhanvari’s subjects who was actually able to continue her career having left Iran after the revolution, flew from Los Angeles to the UK to visit the show. “All of these women were her friends. She was so happy that their stories were being told,” said Sokhanvari. She is also cautiously optimistic about the future of her country, thanks to both an increasingly secular younger generation and more men standing shoulder-to-shoulder with women. “If everybody rises up then we will win and the next generation will make a better Iran,” Sokhanvari said. “You have to have hope, right?” Sheila Sokhanvari “We Could Be Heroes” is on at the Heong Gallery, Cambridge, UK, until 4 February 2024.",World
Meet the Thai celebrities — and ‘boys love’ stars — becoming fashion’s newest power players," (CNN) — Back in February, Nattawin Wattanagitiphat’s fans spared no expense in marking the Thai actor’s 29th birthday. Videos that made their way onto social media showed ‘Apo,’ as he is affectionately known, wading through a sea of flower bouquet stands, multiple cakes towering over six feet tall, gold bars, cash and even a Rolex watch all gifted by his fan base. Local media reported his birthday haul totaled 50 million Thai baht, or around $1.4 million. With such an army of intense supporters behind him, it’s little wonder then that Apo was named by Christian Dior as a men’s ambassador this summer, along with his co-star Phakphum ‘Mile’ Romsaithong. The two actors, who star as an on-screen couple in a BL television series (a “boys’ love” drama featuring gay romance themes) called “KinnPorsche,” have become a valuable marketing vehicle for the brand. The pair have appeared at events across Asia, including Dior’s show in India, and on the covers of various editions of Vogue, GQ and other magazines. One reason they provide a good return on investment is the remarkably high engagement they generate on social media. Data from a report released by Lefty.io, a social media analytics company, and public relations firm Karla Otto found that Apo and Mile were ranked 3rd and 5th in earned media value for the Spring-Summer 2024 show season on Instagram and TikTok — only after Kylie Jenner and Zendaya, who have 399 million and 185 million followers respectively on Instagram. In comparison, the Thai actors have just 3.5 million Instagram followers each. Still, they are able to induce a fanaticism that’s typically only seen with South Korean stars. But Apo and Mile are not the only Thai celebrities gaining traction as brand ambassadors, campaign models and fashion muses. The country has emerged as a hotspot for talent, with Dior adding yet another Thai ambassador this month, actress Tontawan Tantivejakul. Dior would not be drawn on its decision to focus on Thai celebrities, instead describing the three ambassadors in a statement as “exceptional personalities who are always singular, audacious, virtuosos of their fields, symbolizing the zeitgeist.” But the growing popularity of ambassadors from Thailand is no doubt underpinned by the country’s status as a key emerging market for luxury brands, and its role as a cultural, economic and tourism hub not only for Southeast Asia but the wider Asia-Pacific region. Famously welcoming to foreigners, its capital Bangkok frequently ranks as the most visited city in the world according to the Mastercard Index.  And the Thai luxury market is “leading growth” in Southeast Asia, according to a report released this month by consultancy Bain & Company. Thailand’s biggest global star is arguably musician Lalisa Manobal from the K-pop girl group Blackpink. Better known as Lisa, the Celine and Bulgari ambassador has 99 million followers on Instagram. There’s also Bambam (real name Kunpimook Bhuwakul) who followed the K-pop trajectory to fame as part of the now defunct boyband GOT7. He has appeared in YSL Beauty ads and, more recently, attended Pharrell Williams’ debut Louis Vuitton show. But more often than not, the Thai stars who are able to build international fan bases tend to be actors. Davika Hoorne, who starred in Pee Mak, Thailand’s highest grossing film of all time, was named Gucci’s first global brand ambassador from the country last year. Urassaya Sperbund, the Thai-Norwegian actress and model who starred in a Louis Vuitton watch campaign in 2019, rose to international acclaim earlier thanks to a feature in American Vogue. Some of the actors generating the biggest buzz are male celebrities, more specifically those appearing in gay romance plotlines. This summer, ‘Bright’ (Vachirawit Chivaaree), who starred in the popular show “2gether: The Series” was unveiled by Calvin Klein as its new face, on the heels of a Burberry brand ambassadorship. Bright’s co-star on the show, Metawin ‘Win’ Opas-Iamkajorn , has also made a big impact, signing on with Prada at the start of this year. The celebrity endorsement market has evolved into a large enough opportunity that former Vogue Thailand editor Nichapat Suphap this month launched Venture Management, an agency representing leading Thai stars overseas. Starting with six names, in addition to Apo, Mile and Bright, Suphap’s firm manages Wichapas ‘Bible’ Sumettikul, another actor from “KinnPorsche” who starred in a Ralph Lauren fragrance advertisement this year, and actor Kanawut ‘Gulf’ Traipipattanapong, who has appeared at events for Gucci. Currently, Suphap says she’s negotiating deals with luxury watch, luggage and camera brands for her array of celebrities. It’s a far cry from just a few years ago when Thai figures were relegated to the sidelines. “We were not the priority when attending events abroad,” she said. “(Thais) got the leftover looks from western celebrities.” “But now things have changed. Fashion shows shed more spotlight on Thai talents (so) we get custom looks (as) we become more the center of attention, because of the number of fans waiting outside the shows and the amount of online engagement brands get,” Suphap explained. According to data from Launchmetrics, the latest S/S 2024 Christian Dior womenswear show in Paris saw Apo and Mile garner $6 million in media impact value (MIV) each. That puts them nearly on par with Korean musician Jisoo from Blackpink, who generated a MIV of $6.5 million, but ahead of western stars Jennifer Lawrence ($4.5 million), Rosalía ($3.7 million) and Robert Pattinson ($2.7 million). Fatti Laleh, Piaget’s global communications and image director, said she witnessed the fandom for Apo, who she later signed as a friend for the watch and jewelry house, first hand. “He walked with me outside of this five-star hotel during fashion week and I was amazed to see with my own eyes the magnitude of the people that were cheering for him and waiting for him,” Laleh said, adding that many of the fans gathered were European, demonstrating a degree of global appeal. “Beyond the cultural capital, his beauty and aesthetics, it’s what he reaches in media for us.” Although that kind of loyalty may bear a resemblance to the K-pop stars well entrenched within the fashion industry, there are differences to working with Thai talent. Because the Thai entertainment industry is not yet as structured or strictly managed as Korea’s, agencies take a more relatable approach to partnerships, suggests Krisda Witthayakhajorndet, the director of “KinnPorsche.” “Thais are humble and fun,” he said. “Off-screen, I let my actors be themselves… (They’re) not perfect idols. I think the audiences can feel that… I think people are looking for something that’s not that perfect anymore.” Venture Management’s Suphap agrees. “K-pop stars dedicated their lives training (from a young age) to be idols,” but Thai stars, she said, can be more relaxed. For example, they often manage to attend a regular school even while building their public profile. “Of course, we still want to keep them exclusive, but I would say we are more friendly with the fans,” she said. “We say hi to them, we take pictures with some. We don’t really keep the talent in a box like Korean companies do.” Another advantage some Thai celebrities have is their ability to resonate among Chinese audiences. While South Korean celebrities are often still not allowed major exposure  in the country because of political tensions between the two nations, Thais experience no such issue. Moreover, fourteen percent of Thailand’s population are ethnic Chinese — and the number is much higher for those of mixed Chinese-Thai heritage. The biggest obstacle to Thai celebrities becoming even more of a worldwide phenomenon, Suphap said, is something they share with other nationalities across the region: a language barrier. Generally, “they can understand and converse in English of course,” said. “But to give an interview can be a challenge because we can’t express our in-depth knowledge in a matter of seconds. English is definitely the biggest challenge right now.” This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

Disruptive Thanksgiving-week storm affecting much of the East as holiday travel rush begins," A storm system pushing across the eastern US ahead of Thanksgiving is delivering widespread impacts on Tuesday, threatening to disrupt holiday travel with severe thunderstorms, drenching rain and snow. Live Updates: See the latest on delays and disruptions as Thanksgiving travel gets underway At least two dozen states across the East, including major travel hubs from Atlanta to New York City, will contend with adverse weather during two of the busiest travel days of the year. The conditions may cause travel headaches during what is expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period in years, leading to disruptions at airports in large hubs such as Atlanta, New York City, Boston and Washington, DC. But there is still room for optimism. The storm’s impacts are forecast to subside Wednesday as it tracks off the East Coast, leaving much of the central and eastern US to enjoy a dry Thanksgiving day. Track the storm with more maps here. Rain will be heavy at times from southern Alabama to New York as the wide-reaching storm tracks east and expands to the north throughout Tuesday. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible. Some areas, including Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains, could receive over 4 inches. The risk for severe thunderstorms will shift east Tuesday evening and encompass portions of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia into early Wednesday morning. Damaging wind gusts are the main concern, but a brief tornado cannot be ruled out. The storm is also worsening fire weather in the drought- and wildfire-plagued Appalachians. Winds from the storm increased late Monday in the region and prevented steady, beneficial rain from reaching the ground. This caused one fire to flare up and force evacuations in a remote area of Tennessee near Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow will spread across northern New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening. This same wintry mix already  made some roadways slick across portions of Pennsylvania and southern New York early Tuesday. High-elevation areas of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains are most likely to see accumulating snow Tuesday night. As the sun rises in the northeast Wednesday, roads may be slick or snowy in parts of Vermont, New York and New Hampshire due to overnight snowfall. Steady rain and breezy conditions will linger early Wednesday morning across the greater New York City metro but the storm’s impact will taper off significantly by mid-morning as it moves off the East Coast, dumping its final remnants on parts of New England. Snow will accumulate in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire. Thanksgiving Day will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. A storm will begin to build over the northern Rockies on Thursday and strengthen on Friday bringing snow to portions of the Rockies, including Denver and Salt Lake City. CNN’s Andy Rose contributed to this report.",World
"Several tornadoes reported as dangerous storms fire up, threatening 20 million from Texas to the Southeast"," Dangerous thunderstorms rumbled to life across parts of the South on Monday as more than 20 million people from eastern Texas to the Southeast faced a threat of damaging winds, hail and potentially strong tornadoes. The severe thunderstorms moved across eastern Texas and the Mississippi Valley, bringing at least six reports of high winds, including gusts in Copiah County, Mississippi, estimated at more than 60 mph. “A storm system will move from the southern Plains to the Northeast U.S. through Wednesday with severe thunderstorms for the northern Gulf states, gusty winds and heavy rain for the Southeast, and a wintry mix for the interior Northeast,” the National Weather Service said. Tornado watches were in effect Monday night for more than 2.5 million people – mostly in Mississippi – as dangerous storms sprung to life. There were four reports of tornadoes in the state as of 8:15 p.m. CT, following one reported twister earlier in neighboring Louisiana. An enhanced risk level for severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, was in effect Monday night for parts of eastern Louisiana and central Mississippi, including Hattiesburg, Mississippi, the Storm Prediction Center said. The greatest risk for strong tornadoes that could deliver wind speeds over 111 mph – EF2-strength or stronger – remained possible across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley, the center said. Level 1 and 2 severe threats were in place from Texas to Alabama and Arkansas, including Houston and Little Rock, Arkansas. Tornado warnings hadn’t been issued across much of the Southeast since late June, but that changed Monday afternoon. November marks the start of a secondary severe weather season in the region. The clash of cold, Canadian air drilling into the South and lingering warm, moist air over the Gulf of Mexico typically leads to an uptick in damaging thunderstorms from November to December. The storms may bring a brief reprieve to drought-stricken Louisiana and Mississippi, which could see excessive rainfall of up to 2 inches on Monday, and as many as 3 inches in some areas, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Louisiana is suffering through its worst drought on record – one that’s fed unprecedented wildfires and contributed to the potentially catastrophic intrusion of saltwater into the Mississippi River. Exceptional drought – the US Drought Monitor’s most extreme category – now covers nearly three-quarters of the state, according to data released last week. In neighboring Mississippi, exceptional drought has spread over more than half of the state. The same storm delivering severe thunderstorms to the South blew through the Rockies over the weekend, leaving heavy mountain snowfall piled nearly a foot high in several parts of Utah, Nevada and Colorado, preliminary snow reports show. Parts of Utah saw a foot or more of snow, followed closely by some cities in Nevada. Here are some of the latest preliminary snowfall totals reported by the National Weather Service: Lower elevations were still warm enough to receive rainfall, with storm totals of 1 to 3 inches reported and isolated totals exceeding 3 inches. High wind gusts also swept the region, with a gust of 144 mph reported in Mammoth, California, which has an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet.",World
"Significant Thanksgiving-week storm will disrupt travel with rain, snow and severe storms"," A significant storm will deal a blow to Thanksgiving travel this week, with rain, snow and even severe thunderstorms set to impact a large portion of the US. This week is expected to be the busiest in years on the roads and airports could set new records – meaning this week’s headache-inducing weather could not come at a worse time. The havoc-wreaking system will track from the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley on Monday and spread rain across much of the central US. Fortunately for any early week travelers, this rain is not expected to be heavy in most areas. But a different threat has emerged and could snarl travel for portions of the Gulf Coast late Monday afternoon as the storm moves east: severe thunderstorms, including possible tornadoes. Severe weather, while more common in the spring, can happen any time of the year if there’s enough warmth and moisture in the air. Damaging thunderstorms fired up Monday afternoon in east Texas, where the atmosphere is primed with plenty of moisture and warmth. These storms will track across Louisiana, Arkansas and push into Mississippi from Monday evening into early Tuesday morning. Damaging winds and hail are likely within any of Monday’s severe thunderstorms. Several tornadoes are also possible, especially across Louisiana and Mississippi. A fresh input of atmospheric energy and a robust surge of moisture will charge up the storm’s impacts Tuesday and usher in the most widespread, impactful weather of the week. The issues will start early Tuesday morning in the Southeast, where the severe thunderstorm threat will be highest in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Storms could unload damaging wind gusts and perhaps a tornado. Rain will expand east throughout Tuesday and spread into parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, where it will fall heavily at times. This heavy rainfall is unlikely to result in widespread flooding, but may pond on some roadways or in low-lying areas. Breezy conditions will develop across the East on Tuesday, especially in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The combination of gusty winds and drenching rain may lead to disruptions in airport operations for large hubs in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Wintry weather will present another challenge for holiday travelers in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday. Rain will mix with sleet and snow when precipitation begins across the elevated terrain of Pennsylvania Tuesday morning and southern New York by Tuesday afternoon. This wintry mix will expand into parts of Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening and turn mostly to snow in some areas Tuesday night. Accumulating snow Tuesday night will largely be confined to the highest elevations of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains. Weather travel disruptions may not be as widespread on Wednesday as the storm slowly tracks off the East Coast and inland impacts start to diminish. Roadways may be slick or snow-covered in parts of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Wednesday morning following Tuesday night’s wintry weather. More accumulating snow will arrive in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire. Rain will taper off throughout the day across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and much of New York, but will persist across the Carolinas and parts of the Southeast. For travelers across the West, the weather will be perfect for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday with high pressure in control across almost the entire region. Thanksgiving will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. However, this influx of cold air will cause lake-effect snow showers to develop downwind of the Great Lakes. Dry weather is expected for the annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City on Thursday morning, but some breezy conditions may persist. The parade’s famous balloons are typically flown closer to the ground on a breezy day and higher off the ground on a calm day. Elsewhere, a few rain showers may push across coastal Texas while in the West some mountain snow could bring fresh powder to high elevations in the northern Rockies. Weather conditions will generally be calmer for travelers across the eastern half of the US heading home after Thanksgiving festivities on Friday, but the weekend may not be dry. Another storm may develop and move off the East Coast over the weekend. Rain and potential wintry weather is possible across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. It’s still too early to know exactly how, or even if, this storm develops, but details will come into focus by midweek. Travelers in the West should be treated another stretch of favorable conditions as high pressure remains in place.",World
Snow and rain to bring weather woes to millions of Thanksgiving travelers," Multiple storm systems could impact Thanksgiving travelers. Two separate systems will impact holiday travelers Saturday – one in New England and the other along the West Coast – both bringing rain and snow and the possibility of travel delays. The system in the East will push rain and gusty winds into coastal New England and some snow showers across the White and Green Mountains. If you have travel flexibility, and are driving instead of flying, it may be best to wait until Sunday for most of New England. Travelers in and out of Boston will likely encounter rain showers, patchy fog and wind gusts up to 30 mph Saturday. By Sunday, the sunshine will return and winds will decrease to 10 to 20 mph. The West Coast system will begin Saturday in the Portland, Oregon, area and will stretch down through San Diego. Rain will also spread into desert cities, including Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque – and will continue Sunday from Seattle down through Eureka, California. More than 6 million people from Southern California to southern Idaho are under wind advisories through Sunday. Winds could reach 40 to 50 mph with gusts as high as 60 mph in the mountains. “Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles and motorcycles,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said. “Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may result.” Sunday also will see a shift eastward for this system into the Mountain West and Central Plains. Rain, and snow for higher elevations, will stretch from Washington to Colorado. Salt Lake City will see rain showers to start, but as temperatures drop Sunday evening, it will gradually change over to a mix of rain and snow. The focus across the Central Plains will be rain and thunderstorms from Nebraska down through Texas. By Monday, a new threat begins across the Gulf Coast with the possibility for tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds. As this low pressure system deepens and advances eastward, it will also spread rain from Minnesota through Louisiana. Rain chances increase through the day Monday in Shreveport, with thunderstorms developing in the late afternoon and continuing through the evening. The day with the most weather-related headaches for travelers is likely to be Tuesday, with th﻿e low pressure system bringing rain and thunderstorms to the majority of the eastern half of the country. The area looking at possible rain includes major airport cities – New York, Washington, Chicago, and Atlanta. All could see delays and frustrations from the wet forecast. Atlanta could see over an inch of rain in less than 24 hours Tuesday, and winds could gust up to or over 30 mph all day, even though the thunderstorms will be mostly confined to the afternoon.",World
Study reveals first mammal known to mate without using penetration," Bats have long been the odd ones out among mammals. They are the only creatures in this branch of the animal kingdom capable of powered flight. Now researchers say they have discovered another unique trait, with video revealing that the serotine bat may be the first mammal known to mate without using penetration. Also known by the scientific name Eptesicus serotinus, serotine bats mate by touching their genitals together. The male bat uses its penis more like an arm to move a protective membrane away from the female bat’s vulva, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. Bats have “incredible” reproductive biology that has been difficult to study given the nocturnal and secretive nature of many bat species, said study coauthor Nicolas Fasel, a bat specialist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. “Most of the time you’ll see their backs on the wall, and you don’t see what’s really happening in front,” he said. However, thanks to the efforts of a Dutch bat enthusiast who set up 18 video cameras in a church in the Netherlands that was home to a roosting colony of serotine bats, Fasel and his colleagues were able to analyze 93 mating events in detail. Video of an additional four mating events involving the same species came from collaborators at a bat rescue and rehabilitation center in Ukraine. “You can really see the copulation and see that the penis is not going inside,” Fasel said. The footage showed that half of the recorded mating episodes lasted less than 53 minutes, while on one occasion a pair of bats stayed together in a copulative embrace for more than 12 hours. The behavior is similar to a “cloacal kiss,” a way of mating used by many birds. What Fasel and his colleagues observed on the videos may solve a long-standing puzzle about the reproductive biology of this species of bat, and others in the same family. The male bat’s penis is around seven times longer than its female counterpart’s vagina, and it has a heart-shaped head that is seven times wider than the vaginal opening. These are features that appear to make penetrative sex difficult, if not impossible, Fasel noted. Teri Orr, an assistant professor and specialist in bat reproductive systems at New Mexico State University, said she was initially “astonished” to see that males may be using their genitalia as a “copulatory arm” and “maybe transferring sperm much as birds do.” Orr was not involved with the study. “Bats use their uropatagia (tail membranes) in many unique ways such as fishing nets, to catch pups during birth and so forth and thus they are useful in many ways but perhaps an impediment during mating,” Orr said. “I agree that the male of this species may use his genitalia to navigate the female’s tail but there are some key things to be sorted out,” she added via email. “For one: how is the sperm transferred exactly and for another what is the female doing in this pair?” The behavior of the serotine bat reported in the paper is “bizarre and unique” if true, said Alan Dixson, a biology professor at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and the author of the 2021 book “Mammalian Sexuality: The Act of Mating and the Evolution of Reproduction.” However, in his view, the researchers hadn’t provided sufficient evidence to support their unusual claim, added Dixson, who also was not a part of the study. Study coauthor Susanne Holtze, a senior scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, acknowledged that they had not been able to definitively prove the transfer of sperm from male to female bats and said that will be a focus of future research. “It’s a bit of an open question how their semen really gets into the female reproductive tract. It might be that there’s kind of suction involved. We cannot fully answer this mechanism,” she said. Holtze, who specializes in assisted reproduction in animals, said that the information they uncovered during the study would help with her work to come up with a way to artificially inseminate bats. “There are more than 1,000 species of bats, and many of them are also endangered, she said. “So far, no sufficient strategy for assisted reproduction has been established.” Orr, the bat specialist at New Mexico State University, said the study would inform her lab’s work on bat reproduction and whether the unusual reproductive behavior has any implications for understanding human infertility. “Bats do a lot of extreme things during reproduction from storing sperm to extending the duration of a pregnancy,” she explained. There are few bat biologists, and most tend to focus on the more obvious yet still fascinating aspects of bat biology such as flight and echolocation, “rather than what the bats are doing ‘behind closed doors,’” Orr said.",World
‘Lost its soul’: Campaigners decry renovation of Thailand’s iconic ‘Robot Building’," For almost four decades, its cartoonish eyes gazed out placidly over Sathorn, a commercial district in downtown Bangkok. Now, with its facade stripped back to a concrete frame amid major renovations, the tower affectionately known as the “Robot Building” is barely recognizable, save for its characteristically blocky silhouette. The building’s owners, the Thai arm of Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB), say the refurbishment will make its headquarters more energy-efficient and employee-friendly. While the company would not share images of the proposed redesign with CNN, conservationists and architects — including the tower’s 84-year-old designer, who says he was shown plans for the new exterior — have expressed dismay at dramatic alterations being made to an icon of Southeast Asian postmodernism. Completed in 1986, the Robot Building was intended to reflect changes in the banking industry, which at the time was embracing new computer technology. Its designer Sumet Jumsai, who was inspired by one of his son’s toy robots, is considered a major figure in contemporary Thai architecture, and was named a “national artist” by the country’s government. In an email to CNN, Sumet, who is now retired, decried the “defacement” of his creation. He described renovations as a “devastating statement” demonstrating the “ignorance and arrogance (of) big corporations.” In March, the architect wrote to UOB Thailand expressing concern over the loss of the tower’s “original iconic features,” including its eyes, and urging it to reconsider plans “before it is too late.” The bank’s response, which was shared with CNN by Sumet, acknowledged that the building was a “significant landmark” — but said the planned refurbishment would bring it “into a new era while paying homage to its heritage.” The bank added that it will keep a replica of the building’s original form in “a corner of the lobby.” Originally designed for the Bank of Asia, the tower was acquired by UOB Thailand in 2005. The firm told CNN, via email, that its renovations are focused on “promoting environmental sustainability” and “enhancing employee well-being” for the thousands of workers who will occupy the building upon its reopening in 2025. The organization said its redesign will reduce electricity consumption by at least 15%, with a new glass exterior “minimizing the need for artificial lighting and thus reducing associated… carbon emissions.” Standing 20 stories high, the Robot Building’s floors get progressively smaller as they rise, giving the structure its distinctive staggered shape. Its iconic lidded “eyes” served as windows for two executive suites on the upper floors, while the building’s toy-like appearance was completed by antennas — used for communications and as lightning rods — and a series of large metallic nuts decorating its sides. The Robot Building is among a vanishingly small number of landmarks from the era to have survived Bangkok’s breakneck urban development. After recovering from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Thailand’s capital experienced a building boom that transformed areas like Sathorn. Bangkok is now the world’s 14th tallest city, with 112 towers measuring 150 meters (492 feet) or above, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). The Thai branch of Docomomo International, a non-profit dedicated to preserving modern architecture, said it has identified the relatively diminutive Robot Building in its upcoming list of the country’s 20 “most outstanding” structures. In an open letter to UOB Thailand, published in April, the conservation group’s president, Pongkwan Lassus, described the Robot Building as an “historical marker” signaling the transition from late modernism to postmodernism — an architectural movement known for decorative facades, ornamentation and a rejection of the mid-century mantra “form follows function.” Bangkok-based filmmaker Dana Blouin, who is producing an as-yet-unnamed documentary on the Robot Building, said that despite campaigners’ pleas, the tower has now “lost its soul.” “We’ve lost something that was probably more important than anyone realized,” he told CNN via video call. While recognizing the tower may have been viewed as a “novelty,” Blouin said the original design “felt elevated and refined.” He added: “It was still fun, and it was still whimsical. And it was beautiful.” “When it was built, it was one of the tallest buildings (in Sathorn district),” he said. “Today, the structure is minuscule by comparison — it’s dwarfed by these other glass and steel structures all around it. And that made it all the more special.” The filmmaker’s affection may not be shared by many in Bangkok. A petition, started in April by campaign groups including Docomomo, had attracted fewer than 1,700 signatures at the time of writing. Thailand’s conservation efforts and laws, meanwhile, are mostly directed towards the country’s ancient heritage. Campaigners and architects hope that, while it may be too late for the Robot Building, other important examples of contemporary architecture may be spared a similar fate. “After nearly two decades of effort, we are beginning to see a shift from the government sector,” reads Pongkwan’s letter to UOB Thailand. For Blouin, a wider cultural shift is needed if other modern Bangkok landmarks are to be preserved. “The embrace of newness… has led to the forgetting of some of these icons,” he said. “And that’s unfortunate.”",World
This massive ‘floating’ museum is straight out of science fiction," The seven-point metallic star floats on the glassy surface of the lake, reminiscent of a far-flung future civilization, or a spaceship touching down on an alien planet. It looks like something straight out of science fiction. Which it is, in a way: it’s the brand new Chengdu Science Fiction Museum in the capital of Sichuan province in Southwest China. From one side, the dynamic roof mimics the sloping mountains in the distance; from another, the canopy takes on the appearance of a cloud, its cantilever arches suspended above seamless panes of glass. “From every angle, it will always look different; it will always look unusual or unexpected,” said Paulo Flores, one of the project directors at Zaha Hadid Architects, which designed the museum. Perhaps more unexpected than the design itself is the time it took to build. The museum was commissioned in 2022 to host this year’s 81st annual World Science Fiction Convention, nicknamed Worldcon. A building of this size and complexity would typically take four to five years to build, says Flores. But the 59,000 square-meter building — which is three times the size of the Sydney Opera House — went from concept to completion in just 12 months. But despite the tight turnaround for Flores and his team, it was the dream assignment. “Science fiction has always been a very important source of inspiration for our designs,” said Flores. “Science fiction has always taken that leap forward, looking at what technology is currently and what technology could evolve into. “We want to be part of that movement of creating what the future looks like — not only visually, but also technologically.” The London-based architecture firm is no stranger to technology. The firm’s namesake, Zaha Hadid, was a pioneer in digital design, and the tools she used enabled her to create dynamic, futuristic buildings. “We can only create these types of geometries using polygonal modeling software,” explained Flores, which creates a “three-dimensional simulation of the building.” With this project, the technology was not only key to creating an ambitious design, but also executing it rapidly. Just two weeks after the firm won the competition, construction on the project began. Using a variety of design software, including digital modeling analysis, the team was able to accelerate the timeline, and ensure that everyone, from architects to materials manufacturers to construction workers, was on the same page. Satoshi Ohashi, another one of the project directors, said that construction and design happening in parallel “could not have been done without these new tools.” Ohashi added that the digital modeling analysis allowed the team to optimize the building’s structure for Chengdu’s climate. By analyzing weather and environmental parameters, the software informed decisions about the size and angle of the roof overhang to protect interiors from direct sunlight. Green tech is integrated to minimize the building’s operating impact, too, with solar panels embedded into the expansive roof to help power the building, and skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows to reduce the need for artificial light during the day. The team also had to source materials locally to save time and come up with simple ways of making their concept a reality. For example, they created a modular aluminum panel system that sits “underneath the skin” of the roof canopy, which creates “smooth and seamless” curves while also making it quick to produce in a factory, said Ohashi. Already home to more than 20 million residents — and growing — Chengdu has rapidly expanded in the last few decades. Earlier this year, the city topped China’s new first-tier cities list, which ranks metropolises based on factors like resident lifestyle, commercial opportunities, and transport. The Science Fiction Museum is part of a larger “Future City” development in the Pidu district, outside of the city. Known as Chengdu Future Science and Technology City, the 4.6-square-kilometer (1.8-square-mile) site will house multiple new universities, laboratories and offices. “Part of that growth is also this attention to the future, science and technology, integrating that into the city, and growing that economy,” Ohashi explained. The nation’s multi-billion dollar “science fiction industry” includes publishing and film releases, with Chengdu at the center. Chengdu is also the birthplace of Science Fiction World, one of the world’s most-read sci-fi magazines, which was founded in the city in 1979. The museum opened on schedule to host its inaugural event — the first time Worldcon has been hosted in China, and only the second time in Asia. Dave McCarty, vice-chair of Chengdu Worldcon and an organizer with the event for two decades, described the museum as “the best facility by far that the Worldcon has ever been hosted in,” and said having a purpose-built location made the event feel more special compared to hosting it in “cookie-cutter” convention centers. “Having that dedicated space makes a wonderful home for science fiction,” McCarty added. With its successful bid to host the 81st Worldcon, Ohashi hopes that the new museum and event space can become “an iconic landmark that will represent their science fiction industry” and will nurture the ambitions of the burgeoning “Future City.” “They can now say that they are China’s science fiction capital,” he said.",World
"Skeletons unearthed in ‘incredibly rare’ 5,000-year-old Scottish tomb"," The ruins of an “incredibly rare” 5,000-year-old tomb have been uncovered on one of the Scottish Orkney Islands, National Museums Scotland said in a statement on Tuesday. The excavation at Holm, East Mainland, Orkney, revealed a stone structure accessed through a 7-meter (23-foot) -long passage and traces of a cairn – or pile of stones – that would have covered it, representing the “pinnacle of Neolithic engineering in northern Britain,” the statement said. Fourteen articulated skeletons of men, women and children, as well as other human remains, were discovered in one of the six smaller side cells that surrounded a large stone chamber. “In the Neolithic, it would have been an incredibly impressive 15 meter diameter, enormous mound, very substantial stonework, very impressive architecture. Those cells are real feats of engineering,” Hugo Anderson-Whymark, one of the excavation’s co-directors and senior curator of prehistory (Neolithic) at National Museums Scotland, told CNN. Two of the skeletons had been positioned so that they were almost embracing against each other, with two children placed over their heads, Anderson-Whymark said. However, archaeologists have not yet determined the relationships between these individuals. “The preservation of so many human remains in one part of the monument is amazing, especially since the stone has been mostly robbed for building material,” archaeologist Vicki Cummings, head of the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University, who co-directed the excavation, said in a statement. “It is incredibly rare to find these tomb deposits, even in well-preserved chambered tombs and these remains will enable new insights into all aspects of these peoples’ lives,” she added. Only 12 other similar tombs are known to exist in Orkney, referred to as Maes Howe-type passage graves. Most of these remain visible in the landscape – unlike this latest discovery which was buried below ground. It was largely destroyed in the late 18th or early 19th century to provide stone for building a farmhouse, according to the statement, but later rudimentary excavations in 1896 uncovered eight skeletons and prompted local antiquary James Walls Cursiter to hypothesize that it was a ruined tomb. Papers held in a private collection of Curister’s notes contained more clues that allowed archaeologists to undertake a geophysical survey in the hope of pinpointing the potential tomb, and provide the basis for the excavation. “It was quite a surprise to make that discovery,” Anderson-Whymark said. “It’s such a big thing but yet today it’s just a gently rolling field of grass. There’s nothing on the surface to suggest this tomb ever existed there but it would have once been an incredible monument. We’re fortunate they’ve left us just enough of it.”",World
See inside the $50M penthouse that will crown the Waldorf Astoria Miami," The developers behind Miami’s glittering Waldorf Astoria supertall have unveiled the first look at the 1,049-foot tower’s $50 million penthouse, one of the most expensive units to come to market in the city. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom property — which spans some 13,000 square feet — will sit at the top of the nine stacked cubes that make up the vertiginous building, situated on a waterfront stretch in downtown Miami. It’s currently slated to be completed in 2027 by architect Carlos Ott and the firm Sieger Suarez. Renderings of the penthouse’s interior — designed by the firm BAMO — showcase a modern, airy unit with wraparound windows, enclosed balconies, recessed lighting and luxe marble finishes. Rooms include a private gym, spa, library and theater. And, when it’s completed, the penthouse will stand out in Miami’s (currently) unobstructed sky. Though a number of skyscrapers are being built or have been proposed in the South Florida metropolis, the Waldorf Astoria Miami hopes to top out first. “Even with the great skyscrapers of the world — in Dubai, Hong Kong, New York — there’s a lot of towers,” said Ryan Shear, managing partner of the building’s developer, PMG. With the Waldorf Astoria Miami, he continued, “you get to be on top of a world-class city.” With that in mind, the team at BAMO worked with the theme of “transcendence” as they envisioned the building’s interiors, explained principal designer Anne Wilkinson, which include the shared amenities of the building’s 460 residences and 205 hotel rooms and suites. The Waldorf Astoria brand is known for its mainstays: a grand clock in every location, for example, as well as Peacock Alley, a lounge in the historic New York hotel that has since been replicated in its other properties. In Miami, these spaces are meant to evoke a sense of wonder, with Peacock Alley becoming a “conservatory” in the sky, she said, with sweeping views from three sides on the 19th and 20th floors. On those floors, the building’s version of a signature clock is a three-story pendulum that Wilkinson says no other Waldorf Astoria location “has ever attempted.” From at the building’s restaurant on the 21st floor, the pendulum swings down to Peacock Alley, nearly sweeping its 19th floor at just 3 feet off the ground. In the penthouse, Wilkinson said their team took inspiration from the exterior’s geometric architecture in the palette of surfaces and finishings. “(Carlos Ott) described the skin of the building as this reflective surface… you can imagine every facet of those cubes reflecting a different part of the sky,” she said. “I thought that was such a beautiful notion, so we pulled it into the interior. A lot of our colors are these ethereal grays and blues, and even shifting into nighttime inky colors.” Though the original Waldorf Astoria on New York’s Fifth Avenue is best-known for its ornamental Art Deco architecture, Wilkinson believes the clean lines of the Miami iteration and its sky-high penthouse fit well within its legacy. “If you remember back when Waldorf was originally built, Art Deco was quite avant garde,” she said. “And so to me, I think Waldorf is more about being forward-looking. It’s about the design of the moment.”",World
Sydney Opera House at 50: See what Australia’s best-known building could have looked like," On October 20, 1973 — exactly 50 years ago this Friday — the Sydney Opera House was opened to great fanfare by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Completed a decade late and vastly over-budget, the unusual-looking building was not an immediate hit with Australians. Yet, in the decades since, its striking shell-shaped roof helped it become an architectural icon and an UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts over 10 million visitors a year. How different things might have been. Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s successful proposal was just one of 233 entries in an international design competition. Launched in 1955 by New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill, who was a long-time advocate of transforming the site of an old tram depot into an opera house, the contest attracted participants from over 30 different counties. A document outlining the competition criteria, known as the “Brown Book,” described certain architectural requirements: The building would, for instance, need a main hall capable of accommodating 3,000 to 3,500 people (though the final building has a capacity of under 2,700) and parking space for 100 cars. The document also addressed issues like ventilation and exit passageways. But, otherwise, designers were encouraged to indulge their imaginations — with organizers setting no limit for how much money proposals might cost to realize. Entrants were asked only for black and white drawings, including floor plans and diagrams, as well as a report that “should be as concise as possible, explaining only matters which cannot be readily explained on the drawings,” the Brown Book reads. So, in 2019, creative studio NeoMam Studios and now-defunct architecture firm Projection Comunicación Arquitectónica set about researching the entries and visualizing, in full color, how some of the proposals might have looked. They picked seven from the 232 unsuccessful entries — a selection process based both on the merits of the submissions and the amount of information available to researchers. “Some of them had a story, some of them were ones we knew we could do a good job with, and some were ones where we thought, ‘It would have been hilarious if they’d chosen something like this,’” NeoMam Studios’ CEO, Gisele Navarro, recalled in a phone interview with CNN. And while Navarro concludes that competition judges ultimately “made the right choice,” she applauded some of the entrants’ “blue-sky thinking.” Quite how close any of these alternatives came to winning may be lost to history. But legend has it that Utzon’s winning design was initially dismissed, only to be saved from the reject pile by Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen, one of the judges. Here are seven of the alternative designs that didn’t make the cut:",World
Brazil vs. Argentina: Historic World Cup qualifier is overshadowed by violence and chaos at the Maracanã stadium," Brazil suffered its first ever home World Cup qualifying defeat on Tuesday, as Argentina earned a 1-0 win on a night of violence and chaos at the iconic Maracanã stadium. Defender Nicolas Otamendi’s towering header on 63 minutes secured a historic three points for Argentina and condemned Brazil to a third straight qualifying defeat for the first time in the Seleção’s history. However, the match was overshadowed by violence in the stands which delayed the start of the World Cup qualifier. After fighting broke out between the two sets of fans – which were seated together at one end of the stadium – during the national anthems, Brazilian police moved in to quell the violence but their heavy-handed approach with the Argentine supporters incensed Lionel Messi and the rest of the national team. The Inter Miami forward first led his teammates over to the stand where the fighting was taking place and pleaded with both the police and Argentina fans – some of who were seen throwing ripped out seats at the security officials – for calm. Some pictures show crying children in the stands, with one woman carrying a child in her arms as she tries to clamber over the seats and away from the violence. In one remarkable moment, Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez climbed up onto the stand and pulled the arm of a police officer to try and prevent him from using his baton on an Argentina fan. Messi then led the team off the pitch and back into the changing rooms where they stayed for 10 minutes. The match eventually kicked off 30 minutes late. In a statement published to its website, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said mixed fans is “standard” in matches organized by FIFA – soccer’s world governing body – and South American football’s governing body CONMEBOL. “This is not a model invented or imposed by the CBF,” the statement added. The CBF said 1,050 private security guards and 700 military police officers “worked to secure the match.” “Therefore, the CBF reaffirms that the action, security and operation plan for the match were strictly followed, as approved by the RJ Military Police and other authorities.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday there is “absolutely no place for violence” in football. “Such events, as seen during the World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina at the Maracanã stadium, have no place in our sport or society,” he said in a statement. “Without exception, all players, fans, staff and officials have to be safe and secure to enjoy and play football, and I call on all the relevant authorities to ensure that this is respected at all levels.” Brazil’s state military police said in a statement that its officers were “involved in a scuffle among fans,” adding that eight people were arrested, including a woman for allegedly racially abusing a Maracanã worker. CONMEBOL and the Argentine football federation didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s for comment. “The truth is that this group continues to achieve historic things, once again,” Messi told reporters after the match, per Reuters. “Obviously, at the beginning it was bad because we saw how they were beating people. “You think about the family, the people who are there, who don’t know what’s going on and we are more concerned about that than playing a match. At that point the match was secondary. “After that, winning this game like this I think is one of the most important wins that this group has achieved. It is something very nice to be able to win here in Brazil, after how strong they have been at home throughout their history.” In a further unexpected twist at the very end of the night, Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni placed doubt over his position as the national team head coach. “I need to think a lot about what I’m going to do,” Scaolini told reporters. “It’s not goodbye or anything else, but I need to think because the bar is very high. It’s complicated to continue. “It’s difficult to keep winning and these guys make it difficult. It’s time to think this time, I will tell the president, I will tell the players. This team needs a coach who has all the energy possible.” The win keeps Argentina top of World Cup qualifying, while Brazil is now languishing in sixth place and is now without a win in four matches under interim head coach Fernando Diniz, who recently led Fluminense to Copa Libertadores glory. There are 18 rounds in South America’s World Cup qualifying system, with the top six teams progressing to the 2026 event while the seventh-placed country will go into the FIFA play-off tournament, which will involve six countries from other continents.",World
Baseball great Ichiro Suzuki throws shutout against a high school girls’ team in Japan," He may have retired from professional baseball four years ago, but Ichiro Suzuki certainly hasn’t lost his appetite for the game. Likely a future Hall of Famer for his stellar Major League Baseball (MLB) career as an outfielder, Ichiro, 50, not only still likes to play, but he’s doing it as a pitcher. A Japanese high school girls’ team found out just how well he can throw during Ichiro’s annual All-Star game on Tuesday. The game, which was first played two years ago, was set up to encourage women to play baseball in Japan – and Ichiro was certainly all in. According to MLB.com, Ichiro threw a 116-pitch, complete game shutout and struck out nine in the 4-0 victory at the Tokyo Dome. He even dusted off an 86-miles-per-hour fastball during the game which, in truth, might give some of the best hitters in the world something to think about. Ichiro was joined in the game by former MLB pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka – who played for the Boston Red Sox and New York Mets – and retired from professional baseball in 2021, with the pair excited to show off their skills once again. As well as his prowess from the mound, Ichiro also picked up two hits in the game – a relief given he went hitless during the last two years of the exhibition contest, according to MLB.com. “Personally, I am glad to be able to make a hit. I would like to continue training in hopes to motivate the female athletes,” Ichiro said after the game, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. The Japanese great certainly inspired the opposition during the game, both with his exploits as well as being struck out by Okayama Gakugeikan High School’s Ryona Domae in one inning, leading the aspiring young athlete to beam with excitement. “I was really looking forward to this match with Ichiro. I was determined to get a win, but the fact that I got to strike him out is a memory I will cherish forever,” Domae said on Japan’s TBS Sports. “Knowing that I was able to strike out Ichiro, I think I can compete with confidence in future matches.” Ichiro praised the pitcher, saying to an ecstatic Domae: “I had a weird feeling [being struck out] – I typically have very few strike outs. You should be proud of yourself.” Ichiro’s professional debut came with the Orix Blue Wave of Japan’s Pacific League on July 11, 1992. He played in Japan from 1992-2000, winning three consecutive MVP awards and seven straight batting titles. When he made the move to the Seattle Mariners in 2001 – becoming the first Japanese position player to sign with an MLB team – Ichiro emphatically made his mark. He went on to win the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards that year, becoming just the second player ever to win both honors in the same season. From 2001-2010, Ichiro won 10 consecutive Gold Glove Awards and made 10 straight trips to the All-Star Game. In 2016, he recorded his 3,000th MLB hit to join an elite list of players to reach such a landmark. In addition to the Mariners, Ichiro played for the New York Yankees and Miami Marlins in his MLB career. For fans itching for more of Ichiro on the field after Tuesday’s game, the baseball great had some good news as he emphasised that the series would continue. “I felt the energy of everyone and it was the most happiest moment me – and I believe it was for Matsuzaka and the high school team as well. Thank you so much everyone,” he added. “But especially for the high school female athletes who will continue on with this sport, in hopes that I can be their motivation. I will continue my training and so will Matsuzaka. I want to do this again next year at the Tokyo Dome!”",World
"Tom Brady is not impressed with today’s NFL, says there’s ‘a lot of mediocrity’"," Tom Brady may have called time on his football career, but that hasn’t stopped him from keeping a close eye on the NFL this season. And the legendary quarterback isn’t particularly impressed with what he’s been seeing. Speaking on a recent episode of “The Stephen A. Smith Show,” seven-time Super Bowl winner Brady was in a damning mood as he lamented the current standard of play in the NFL. “I think there’s a lot of mediocrity in today’s NFL. I don’t see the excellence that I saw in the past,” he said. Asked why he felt that way, Brady added: “I think the coaching isn’t as good as it was. I don’t think the development of young players is as good as it was. I don’t think the schemes are as good as they were. “I think the rules have allowed a lot of bad habits to get into the actual performance of the game. So I just think the product, in my opinion, is less than what it’s been.” Brady, who retired from the NFL in February after a 23-year career with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, alluded to the increased scrutiny around roughing-the-passer – which is intended to protect quarterbacks from injury – and unnecessary roughness rules. He found himself at the center of this debate last year when he benefited from a controversial roughing-the-passer call as the Bucs held on to beat the Atlanta Falcons. “Guys are competitive. Guys play hard,” Brady said. “I look at a lot of [former] players like Ray Lewis and Rodney Harrison and Ronnie Lott and guys that impacted the game in a certain way and every hit they would have made would have been a penalty [today]. He added: “Offensive players need to protect themselves. It’s not up to a defensive player to protect an offensive player. “A defensive player needs to protect himself … I think a lot of the ways that the rules have come into play have allowed this – you can essentially play carefree and then if anyone hits you hard, there’s a penalty. And it’s very different than when I was playing.” The 46-year-old said that his teams used to work on the “fundamentals” of players not being tackled, but added that, in today’s game, “they’re trying to be regulated all the time.” Brady retired from the NFL with a record number of Super Bowl rings. He also won more games and passed for more yards and for more touchdowns than any other player in the history of the league. Denver Broncos safety Kareem Jackson, who was suspended by the NFL for four games – later reduced to two on appeal – in late October after multiple unnecessary roughness violations, posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, of Brady’s interview in apparent support of the NFL legend’s comments. Tuesday’s post came after Jackson was again handed a four-game suspension for repeated violations of player safety rules after a hit – which was not penalized during the game – on Minnesota Vikings quarterback Joshua Dobbs in Denver’s 21-20 win on Sunday night. The win was the safety’s first game back from his October suspension. Commenting on the latest suspension, which Jackson can appeal, NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan wrote in a letter to the Broncos safety: “You could have made contact with your opponent within the rules, yet you chose not to.” Former Super Bowl champion cornerback Richard Sherman, who defended Jackson after his previous suspension, responded to the new suspension and Brady’s comments, posting on X: “The product is suffering. Calling a player ‘dirty’ because he plays a physical brand of football that would have him on every highlight tape on every network when this game was great. Skewed the game so that players don’t have to be as skilled to be productive.”",World
"LeBron James becomes the first NBA player to score 39,000 points as LA Lakers clinch In-Season Tournament knockout spot"," Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James reached yet another milestone in his legendary career on Tuesday night as he became the first player in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to score 39,000 career points. During the first quarter of the Lakers’ 131-99 home win against the Utah Jazz, James knocked down a three-pointer in the first quarter to make scoring history at the Crypto.com Arena. James previously broke the all-time mark of 38,387 – held by fellow Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – in February this year and is now in uncharted territory. According to the NBA, his current scoring pace suggests that he is on track to reach 40,000 points later this season. “I got congratulated by my teammates and coaches, (but) I haven’t had an opportunity to really wrap my head around what that means,” James said after the game, per the NBA. “There’s been so many great players that came across this league since the beginning of time, and so many great scorers. To be able to accomplish something that’s the first of anything, I think that’s always pretty cool. It’s a wild moment, that’s for sure.” With the very same bucket, the ‘King’ also notched another landmark achievement. James made his 2,291st three-pointer, moving him past Vince Carter and up to seventh in the all-time list. The 21-year veteran scored two more threes on the night and posted 17 points, seven rebounds and nine assists as the Lakers ran out comfortable winners in their final Group Play game of the NBA’s new In-Season Tournament. Having gone 4-0 in West Group A, the Purple and Gold have sealed a spot in the knockout round of the tournament. Given the ever increasing history that the 38-year-old continues to make, it is perhaps serendipitous that it will all now be documented in one place. LeBron James’ Home Court, a museum dedicated to James and his milestones, will open in the Ohio native’s hometown of Akron on November 25th. According to the NBA, the museum will be a “multimedia experience” and feature items and exhibitions from his childhood, his high school basketball days and his NBA career. The items on show include the famous all-white suit James wore on NBA Draft day in 2003 and an original backboard and rim from St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, where he became arguably the most anticipated prospect in the history of the sport. “My dream was always to put Akron on the map, so to have a place in my hometown that allows me to share my journey with my fans from all over the world means a lot to me,” James said. “I’ve been known to hang on to a lot of things over the years, and I always knew there would be a time and place to bring them out.”",World
Meet the people who are making the world a better place," The ideas can be simple: converting a vehicle into a wash station for homeless veterans. Providing books for kids while they wait at the barbershop. Turning a passion for diving into a movement to save coral reefs. These are just some of the incredible efforts performed by the people who have been selected as this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Each will receive a $10,000 prize. Their journey began with nominations sent in by CNN’s audience and now you can vote to help decide who will be named the 2023 CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause. All of the honorees will receive a grant along with organizational and capacity-building support from The Elevate Prize Foundation. They will also participate in the foundation’s annual Make Good Famous Summit in Miami. ﻿CNN has teamed up with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s honorees and learn more about their stories. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ nonprofit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com. The CNN Hero of the Year will be revealed live during “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” hosted by Anderson Cooper on Sunday, December 10, starting at 8 p.m. ET. Read more about each of this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes, below: Growing up, Yasmine Arrington knew firsthand the challenges that came with having an incarcerated parent. “My father has been in and out of jail and prison my entire life,” she said. “I began to do research, and I learned that there’s so many other people that are kind of my age experiencing what I’m experiencing.” When she was 16, she created the nonprofit ScholarCHIPS – with CHIPS as an acronym for Children of Incarcerated Parents – to help young people like herself with scholarships, mentoring and a network of support. The organization has since awarded more than $450,000 in scholarships and other aid and supported more than 80 scholars working toward their college degrees. New scholars join the program each year. In many regions of Ghana, it can take hours to get to the nearest hospital. As a result, many people lose their lives to treatable illnesses. Osei Boateng experienced this personally when he lost his grandmother and aunt. Feeling an urgent call to help, Boateng decided he would make it his life’s mission to bring health care to remote communities in Ghana. “These people don’t have the luxury of time,” Boateng said. Boateng started his nonprofit, OKB Hope Foundation, and in 2021, he converted a van into a mobile doctor’s office and started bringing health care directly to those in need. A few times a week, the mobile clinic and medical team travel long distances to remote communities in Ghana and provide free routine medical care. In 2008, a stroke and subsequent traumatic brain injury (TBI) nearly killed Stacey Buckner. Today, she says her miraculous road to recovery led her to the outreach work that has become her life’s mission. Through her program, Off-Road Outreach, Buckner has helped more than 1,000 veterans in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Using her own off-road vehicle – a Jeep that has accommodations for water, heating, and cooking – Buckner provides mobile showers, laundry services, and meals to homeless veterans. Since 2015, Buckner travels to hard-to-reach places each week to find and serve veterans in need. Without judgment, Buckner asks what she can do to help them. “There should be no homeless vets, period,” Buckner said. “I am to a lot of them their only family.” In 1996, Mike Goldberg left his job in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving. Goldberg and his family later settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives. As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE. Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving. “There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said. When Tescha Hawley received her breast cancer diagnosis at age 46, the lifesaving treatment she needed several times a month was at a hospital a three-hour drive away. Hawley, a member of the Gros Ventre tribe, has two master’s degrees, yet the challenges she had to navigate to receive the care she needed were daunting. As a single mother, Hawley ultimately took leave without pay to complete her treatment. “As American Indian people, we represent the highest (rates) of everything – diabetes, heart disease, cancer – and we receive the poorest health care,” Hawley said. After her experience, Hawley founded the Day Eagle Hope Project in 2017, and her nonprofit has since expanded to address many other needs of Native Americans in her community. In 2008, first grade teacher Alvin Irby stopped by a Bronx barbershop after school for a haircut. Before long, one of his students came in. “He’s kind of looking bored,” Irby recalled. “I’m looking at this student (thinking), ‘He should be practicing his reading.’ But I didn’t have a book.” That moment stayed with Irby, and five years later he started Barbershop Books. Since 2013, the nonprofit has brought more than 50,000 free children’s books to more than 200 barbershops in predominantly Black neighborhoods across the country. Irby is working to change lower literacy rates by encouraging boys to read for fun, on their own. “Our program is about getting kids to say three words: ‘I’m a reader,’” he said. Kevin Pearce was at the height of his professional snowboarding career and bound for the Winter Olympics. During training, he struck his head on the edge of a halfpipe, resulting in a traumatic brain injury. He had to relearn how to walk and talk. He eventually started yoga, and his family saw how it transformed him and gave him a sense of hope. “I remember … coming out of a class with him and just seeing in his face this new expression, this new person,” his brother Adam Pearce said. Wanting to bring hope and healing to others through yoga and meditation, Adam and Kevin co-founded the LoveYourBrain Foundation. The organization aims to create a safe space and supportive community where people with a TBI can heal together. Estefanía Rebellón understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world. She was a migrant child, too. In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana, Mexico, that she put her acting career on hold. “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said. Rebellón and her partner used their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the US-Mexico border. Then they transformed buses into mobile classrooms to reach more families. Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the border. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children. Every parent’s worst nightmare is losing their child. Shamayim Harris has lived through that nightmare – twice. Her 2-year-old son was struck and killed in a hit-and-run in 2007 in Highland Park, a suburb of Detroit. Years later, her 23-year-old son was shot and killed while on a neighborhood watch. “I needed to … change grief into glory, pain into power,” said Harris, who is known as Mama Shu. In 2016, she created the Avalon Village, a nonprofit with the mission of creating a safe and nurturing space for the entire Highland Park community. Today, she and her organization own 45 lots of land across three blocks. The biggest project has been fully refurbishing an abandoned house into an after-school hub for children. Dr. Kwane Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago. On a whim, the veterinarian stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee. Stewart treated the dog’s skin condition and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was a wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter. Stewart’s nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. “It doesn’t matter what your situation is … I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help,” Stewart said.",World

"For hundreds of migrant children living in shelters at the border, this CNN Hero’s mobile classrooms offer education and stability"," Estefanía Rebellón knows the trauma that stems from being forced to flee your home for safety. She understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world. She was a migrant child, too. “My family’s case is the case of many refugees and migrants at the border. It was never a choice for our family to leave our home. We were forced out of it,” Rebellón, 32, said. She was 10 when her family fled Cali, Colombia, because of death threats to her father, who had been forced into hiding. They settled in Miami, and with the support of teachers at school, Rebellón thrived. Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the US-Mexico border. Rebellón moved from Miami to Los Angeles when she was 21 to pursue an acting career. In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana that she put her career on hold. “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said. “I couldn’t forget about what I had just seen. And I was like, ‘I literally have to go back.’” Rebellón and her partner, Kyle Schmidt, used about $1,000 of their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the border. They enlisted volunteer teachers to provide learning opportunities in the camps. “We set up a school overnight and … told just a couple of kids,” Rebellón said. “It spread throughout the camp, and we had like over 50 kids surrounding us.” In the months that followed, when those families living in the camps were moved to shelters, Rebellón and Schmidt wanted to continue offering educational services. “I thought, “Why don’t we turn a bus into a mobile classroom, and we could take it to all the different shelters?” Rebellón said. “We literally just Googled and YouTubed how to convert a bus into a mobile classroom.” Over the next year, Rebellón and Schmidt bought and gutted a bus, partnered with shelters, and drove the transformed bus over the border. Their goal: to provide bilingual educational programs to keep children in school. “All the families that we work with and all the children that we work with on a daily basis are legally seeking asylum,” Rebellón said. “They’re going through all the processes that are being required of them.” Rebellón’s organization hires professional teachers and tailors their curriculum to the specific needs of each student. The program has been accredited by the education secretary in Mexico and serves children ages 3 to 15 – a crucial period for education, Rebellón says. Despite the challenges she faced as a migrant child, she says she was lucky to have teachers who advocated for her and guided her along the way. Many migrant children do not have this support and often fall through the cracks and miss valuable school time. Many have been on the road for months, if not years, and have difficulty attending school because they are often in transit, without a permanent home. Safety, economic instability, poverty, lack of transportation, and perceived legal status are also factors. “People don’t realize that this is such a long process for families,” Rebellón said. “It’s not just like you arrive at the border, you seek asylum, and your life is all rainbows. It takes decades and a lot of work and a lot of pain.” Rebellón’s family navigated a decades-long legal process to obtain political asylum and later US citizenship. Her parents, both lawyers by trade, were forced to abandon their careers in Colombia and take on new jobs in the US to support their family of five. Her mother worked multiple jobs as a caregiver and her father worked nights at Walmart. He has worked there full time for nearly 20 years. “Any time I get a chance, I share my immigration story with (the kids),” Rebellón said. “I always want the kids that come through our programs to realize that being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of.” Today, Yes We Can Foundation educates 250-300 kids a day through its four school locations along the border and three mobile school buses. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children from 10 countries. Their program runs Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. School runs for the entire year, with no summer breaks. They also provide free uniforms, backpacks, and school supplies. Lessons focus on common core instruction in the subjects of language arts, math, and science as well as addressing practical and immediate needs like how to translate basic information including phone numbers and addresses. “I want our efforts to be something permanent,” Rebellón said. “And that when it’s all said and done, we will be proud to look back and say that we were there when people needed us the most.” Want to get involved?

"US has ‘working list’ of hostages they believe are likely to be released by Hamas Thursday, source familiar says"," US officials have a working list of 10 hostages that they believe are likely to be released from Gaza on day one, a source familiar told CNN. It was not clear whether any of the three American hostages —including three-year-old Abigail Edan — would be released on the first day. The deal is structured in such a way that each day, a group of hostages to be released would be handed off to the Red Cross; the Red Cross would then take the group to a designated border point, which will largely depend on the location of those hostages, the source familiar said. Many of the first 50 hostages are expected to come out through Egypt, they said. A source familiar with how hostages are expected to leave Gaza told CNN that the first swap is expected to take place on Thursday at 10 a.m. Israeli time (3 a.m. ET). 50 Israel hostages — including some with dual nationalities — are expected to be released over the four-day pause. 10 is the minimum number of hostages to be released each day, but that could be higher. Every evening before the next day’s release Israel and Hamas will give the Red Cross the list of hostage and prisoner names being released. Hostages will be brought by the Red Cross to Rafah where they will be met by specially trained Israeli soldiers. They will verify that the hostages released were the people expected and on the list. The families of the hostages will not be notified until the identities of those released have been confirmed. Hostages will then be taken by helicopter to several designated hospitals in Israel where there will be special areas and rooms for them, closed to the public. There, their families will finally be able to see them after over six weeks in captivity. The first two days of the hostage release will be treated as a “testing period,” the source said, to make sure the process is working. By day three, there is expected to be intense discussions about the potential second phase of the hostage release beyond the initial group of 50. “The first swap is the most crucial to see that the mechanism is working as was agreed,” the source said. In terms of the remaining hostages, including Israeli soldiers, Hamas had initially tried to designate all Israeli women under 45 as soldiers, given that women have to serve in the Israeli military and are often reservists, the source said. Israel rejected that, and the two sides agreed that only women serving, in uniform when they were abducted, would be designated as soldiers. As part of the deal the Red Cross is expected to be able to visit and offer medical support to the hostages that remain in Gaza, the source said. White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk told CNN’s Boris Sanchez Wednesday he could not speak to the schedule of when the Americans would be released. He confirmed that three US hostages – Edan and two women — are expected to come home as part of the 50 hostages released by Hamas. A total of 10 Americans are believed to be hostages. “I was asked earlier do we know if the 50 are alive and well. We understand they’re alive, but they’re certainly not well,” McGurk said. “These 50 women, children and toddlers, it’s just unimaginable what they’ve gone through, but we’re gonna make sure that they get the care they need when they come home.” McGurk said he is “hopeful” that the Red Cross will get access to the other hostages but noted, “I cannot confirm that nor guarantee that.” McGurk suggested that the humanitarian pause and hostage releases could continue beyond the initial four-day period, saying they “do have some assurances” on this. “For this humanitarian pause to continue, we have to see more hostages coming out,” he said. “We do have some assurance that even beyond the four-day period, on day five, day six, we will meet that benchmark to extend the humanitarian pause at least by those of period of days, but I can’t guarantee that.” “We have to see and again, we’re dealing with Hamas, a terrorist group here, who’s holding toddlers and babies at the other end of the table,” he said. Meanwhile, the Israeli Supreme Court “has now greenlit the (hostage) deal to go forward,” thus clearing the way for the process to move forward on Thursday, McGurk said. Asked on “CNN News Central” if there are concerns around the release of the Palestinian prisoners, McGurk noted that “the Israelis are balancing a number of different objectives and risks and they determined that the release of the Palestinian prisoners in this circumstance, after a full debate within their government, was the way to proceed.” “And I know that was actually discussed today before the Israeli Supreme Court and I understand the Supreme Court has now greenlit the deal to go forward,” he said. A senior Israeli official told CNN Tuesday that there was a 24-hour window following the announcement of the deal for appeals to be lodged with the court. The Supreme Court has rejected a legal challenge to the Gaza hostage deal, which includes the release of at least 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The Almagor association, which was set up in 1986 to represent victims of terror, had claimed that the government’s decision, among a series of objections, intensified the risk of “the recurrence of serious acts of terrorism to which all the citizens and residents of the country are exposed.” Almagor had asked the Supreme Court to “annul the government’s decision … [and] order [the government] to discuss again the terms of the deal with Hamas,” according to information released by the court. The court said it rejected the petition outright on the grounds that the hostage deal, “is a clear political issue to which this court does not consider its involvement as necessary.” The ruling clears any legal objection in Israel to the execution of the deal that involves the exchange of Israeli hostages in Gaza for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.",US Politics
New Hampshire voters take note as Haley rises in the polls," Kathy Rice had yet to attend any 2024 campaign stops before this week, but when former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced a town hall in her hometown, the 54-year-old decided to see what the buzz around her was about. She went into the event here hoping to hear from Haley on three key issues: the economy, immigration and foreign policy. “She’s great,” Rice said as she left. “She’s very powerful. She’s very relatable. And she gets it.” It was just short of an endorsement. “We’re lucky here in New Hampshire that we get a chance to see so many different candidates,” she said. For weeks Haley has been gaining momentum in the Granite State, where recent polls show her in second place — well behind former President Donald Trump but increasingly ahead of the other candidates seeking to consolidate the state’s non-Trump vote. Despite the former president’s overwhelming lead, Haley’s campaign is hoping she can seal the deal with undecided voters like Rice as she runs on her record as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations and the six years she led the Palmetto State. Best case scenario, early state voters – known for breaking late in ways that defy conventional wisdom – might still surprise the country and support someone who isn’t the former president. For now, many voters still want to be courted. “We’ve got to do whatever it takes to save America,” Haley said at her second town hall of the day, in Raymond. “But in order to do that, it’s gonna take a lot of courage, courage from every single person in this room — and the overflow room.” A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released last week showed that 20% of likely GOP primary voters would support her, up from 12% in September, placing her firmly in second place. Trump received support from 42% of primary voters, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie received 14%, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was backed by 9% and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy had 8%. The poll found that 52% of likely GOP primary voters in the state had made up their mind. Haley’s debate performances and rise in early state polling numbers — here in New Hampshire, as well as South Carolina and Iowa — have led to new interest from GOP megadonors. But the upswing has also led to increased scrutiny and criticism from her rivals, particularly of her foreign policy record. Her primary opponents have attacked those credentials from all sides. DeSantis and the super PAC backing him have hammered her from the right, going after her work recruiting Chinese business to South Carolina when she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. Ramaswamy, with whom she’s shared some of the sharpest exchanges in the past three primary debates, has consistently tried to brand her as a hawk. In the first debate, he mockingly congratulated her on future positions on the boards of defense contractors, and in the third debate, he called her “Dick Cheney in three-inch heels,” a reference to the unpopular former vice president and his role in shaping foreign policy under former President George W. Bush. Several of her rivals jumped at the opportunity to blast her proposal earlier this month that all social media users should be verified by name, which she cited as a national security issue. Haley later walked the policy back. But those moments don’t always resonate on the trail. Kay Vasile, a 59-year-old office manager from Barrington who attended the Raymond town hall, hadn’t heard about the social media proposal. But she was struck by the way Haley talked about veterans’ issues, the impact those policies have on families and the need to provide better mental health services. Haley’s husband, an Afghanistan veteran, is currently deployed with the South Carolina National Guard. Vasile, who said her husband was in the Air Force for 37 years, brought up veterans’ care when it was her turn in the photo line following the town hall. “I just thanked her for that and let her know that, you know, it’s true,” she said. “When he came back from Iraq it was – the guard base did as good as they could with integrating and helping with that, but it needs to be longer.” Still, she has more research to do. “I like Chris Christie, what he has to say. I loved (South Carolina Sen. Tim) Scott and I liked (former Vice President Mike) Pence, but they’re gone,” she said. “So, she’s my next one.” Since Haley launched her presidential campaign in February, she has held more than 60 events in the state across 10 counties. This week, her campaign released the slate of New Hampshire delegates that will represent her at the Republican National Convention next summer, touting it as evidence of the “depth of support” she has there. The campaign recently announced a $10 million ad buy reservation in New Hampshire and Iowa across digital, TV and radio. “We have a long way to go and there’s going to be continued movement within the field here,” said veteran New Hampshire GOP strategist Jim Merrill. “But I think where she is in New Hampshire comes as a product of her sweat equity and the time she’s put in here.” New Hampshire Republican Gov.Chris Sununu, who has not endorsed but has attended campaign events with most of the major candidates, said nine weeks is plenty of time for candidates to make an impression on Republican and independent voters, many whom haven’t decided who they’ll support. “Sometime after Thanksgiving we’ll have those hard conversations,” said Sununu. “Sometimes the awkward conversations with the weird uncles and the crazy cousins that come over for Thanksgiving. But that’s the way we do it.” Part of making an impression is rolling with the punches. During the question and answer session of the Hooksett town hall, Haley complimented 9-year-old Hannah Kesselring on her hat, a piece of Haley campaign swag. “Thank you, one of your guys gave it to me for free,” she said, setting off a wave of laughter through the crowd. “I want you to tell me which guy that was, because we don’t do things for free,” Haley replied, drawing more laughs. Kesselring then asked what Haley would tackle first if elected. Later, flanked by her parents Steve and Kim, Hannah said she thought Haley’s answer — she said she would hire new agency heads — was “spot on” and called Haley “awesome.” Steve, a 40-year-old small business owner, said he wanted to hear from Haley because he liked what’d he’d seen of her at the United Nations (and because Hannah said she wanted to meet Haley after watching the third GOP debate). But the event hadn’t helped narrow down his options. “I would say that, yes, I do like a lot of what DeSantis has to say. I do like a lot of what Haley has to say. And I like what Trump did,” he said. “So at the end of the day, it’s really a tough, split decision to know where to go.” Not everyone left undecided. New Hampshire state Rep. Stephen Pearson said he was impressed by Haley’s performance at the first GOP debate, but wanted to hear her off the debate stage. By the end of the town hall, he’d decided to endorse her. Pearson said he appreciated Haley’s efforts to share “hard truths” – things people need to hear even if they may not like it. And as a lieutenant in the Manchester Fire Department, he appreciated her comments on fentanyl, which has made the ongoing opioid epidemic in the city worse. “I see the reality,” he said. “It’s something that is just devastating to this country.” John Hallinan, a 72-year-old security head for local circuit courts, described himself as an independent who is frustrated with the Republican Party’s position on abortion in the wake of recent electoral losses. Haley’s comments in past debates about seeking consensus on the issue resonated with him. He also saw her as a better option than the front-runner. He liked Trump’s policies, but had grown tired of the “noise” surrounding him. “Right now, to me, his candidacy is more of a revenge tour, and that bothers me,” he said. “She’s refreshing. She’s an underdog. She’s an achiever. I have followed her since she was at the UN. Very impressed tonight.” At the center of Haley’s case for her candidacy has been the two years she served as US ambassador to the United Nations. Her stump speech is peppered with nods to her time there dealing with China, Russia and Iran, while working with US allies like Israel and Ukraine. At one point, Haley criticized the congressional debate over funding for the border, aid to Ukraine and aid to Israel, arguing all three are critical. “There’s a reason the Taiwanese want us in the West to support the Ukrainians: because they know if Ukraine wins, China won’t invade Taiwan. There’s a reason the Ukrainians want us to support the Israelis: because they know the dangers that if Iran wins, for them, Russia wins,” she said. “It’s all connected.” Don Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general and controversial, failed 2022 Republican nominee for Senate in New Hampshire, tried to inoculate Haley from the criticisms of her foreign policy while introducing her. “She knows what it’s like when a service member comes home after being in a combat zone for a year and has to readjust to family life and to life outside of a combat zone,” Bolduc, the chairman of her New Hampshire campaign, told the audience in Hooksett. “So those people out there that call her a war monger or someone who’s beating a war drum, have no idea what they’re talking about.” In an interview, he said that Haley is about “preventing conflict, preventing wars.” Jeffrey Reaume, a 56-year-old engineer from Portsmouth, said he was still surveying the field after Haley’s Raymond town hall and described her foreign policy as a “mixed bag” for him. “I’m for supporting Ukraine. I’m for supporting Israel, to a point,” he said. “I think making China out to be the big bad wolf that can’t be dealt with any other way — I think that we’ve done that before. It doesn’t usually work out well.” But Natalie Cote, a 59-year-old artist from Raymond, called Haley “absolutely brilliant” as she walked out of the Monday night town hall, her first time seeing her in person. “I feel her experience really suits the problems that we’re having in the world today,” she said. Asked how she might vote in the primary, however, she stayed noncommittal. “I need to do more research,” she said.",US Politics
Formation of new super PAC raises questions about tensions between DeSantis and Never Back Down," The formation of a new super PAC backing Ron DeSantis is raising fresh questions about discord between the Florida governor’s official campaign and Never Back Down, the super PAC that has taken a leading and unprecedented role in advertising and establishing a ground game for DeSantis’ presidential bid. Fight Right Inc. registered as a super PAC with the FEC last week, meaning it can accept unlimited contributions and make independent expenditures in support of DeSantis’ White House bid. Its creation comes with less than two months to go before the caucuses in Iowa, where DeSantis has focused his campaign strategy. The launch of the new political action committee occurred at least in part because negative ads run by the first super PAC aligned with the Florida governor, Never Back Down, were becoming too closely associated with the candidate, according to a source familiar with the situation. DeSantis and his wife, Casey, are not unhappy with Never Back Down’s efforts overall, the source said, but they didn’t think the ads were as strong as they could be. “I think overall he’s impressed with the ground game operation there,” the source told CNN, but added that the couple were “not as impressed with the ads as they would like to be.” A second source said there were concerns about the close association between DeSantis and the negative ads being run by Never Back Down and that the idea of a new group that is not as synonymous with the candidate running ads is a welcome development. The Florida governor often appears at events sponsored by Never Back Down. That super PAC has already spent at least $41 million boosting him and millions more on the campaign events featuring DeSantis, having received a transfer of more than $80 million in political funds that he had stockpiled in his state-level fundraising committee ahead of the White House race. While the DeSantis campaign has downplayed talk of tension with Never Back Down, their alliance has not always been seamless, including when a memo from the super PAC was published ahead of the first debate advising the Florida governor on his strategy. The memo suggested DeSantis “hammer” entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and defend former President Donald Trump if he was attacked by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. It caused confusion and anger among donors and fundraisers, and DeSantis himself tried to distance himself from it. “So, that is not part of me. That’s a separate entity. I had nothing to do with it. It’s not something that I’ve read, and it’s not, not reflective of my strategy,” DeSantis said at the time. Fight Right Inc., the new PAC, has already booked about $918,000 worth of advertising time over the next week, with ads set to start running in key Iowa media markets on Thanksgiving. DeSantis found out about the formation of the new super PAC yesterday, after seeing it placed an ad-buy, according to the second source. “We are excited to see even more backers stepping up to support Ron DeSantis’ candidacy,” DeSantis campaign communications director Andrew Romeo said in a statement. “We’ve already seen tremendous value in the support of groups like Never Back Down, and adding new allies to the mix to independently help spread the Governor’s message will only strengthen our advantage in the important weeks and months ahead.” The new group could complement Never Back Down’s efforts, but also compete for donors, some of whom have already expressed skepticism about the high burn-rate of DeSantis’ political operation. And it will also compete for airtime on Iowa airwaves that have been and will continue to be bombarded by campaign advertising. Already, campaigns and outside groups have aired more than $75 million worth of advertising in Iowa, and nearly $9 million in future reservations have been booked through January.",US Politics
"US fires on and kills hostile forces, launches precision airstrikes after attack in Iraq"," ﻿The US military has taken a number of retaliatory actions after multiple close-range ballistic missiles were launched against US and coalition forces at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq on Monday evening. A US military aircraft – an AC-130 gunship – had responded immediately to the attack, firing on a vehicle and killing a yet unknown hostile forces, a US official told CNN on Tuesday. Later in the day, US Central Command announced that the US had also launched precision airstrikes on two facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group in Iraq. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday that the attack by Iranian-backed militants resulted in “several non-serious injuries and some minor damage to infrastructure.” It marked, according to Singh, the first time that a ballistic missile was used since attacks on US and coalition forces began on October 17. Two US officials said the US AC-130 gunship, which is capable of firing artillery at ground-based targets, was acting in defense. US Central Command said Tuesday evening that the airstrikes were “in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups, including the one in Iraq on November 21, which involved use of close-range ballistic missiles.” A defense official added that the facilities – an operations center and command and control node near Al Anbar and Jurf al Saqr, Iraq, south of Baghdad – were used by Kataib Hezbollah to “support recent attacks on US and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria.” “Initial evaluation of the strikes indicate that US forces successfully destroyed the intended facilities. Additionally, we can confirm the presence of Kataib Hezbollah personnel,” the official said. “We’re unable to provide a casualty assessment at this time.” At least eight Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah fighters were killed and four other wounded following the US strikes, the group said in a statement. “The crime of the American bombing of the Popular Mobilization Forces headquarters at dawn today, in which eight people became martyrs, will not go unpunished, which requires expanding the scope of targets if the enemy continues its criminal approach,” the statement said. The Iraqi government also issued a statement on Wednesday, condemning the airstrikes as a violation of its sovereignty. Government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi declared the strikes were conducted “without the knowledge of Iraqi government agencies” and deemed them an “unacceptable violation.” However, al-Awadi also criticized the Iran-backed groups for their actions, emphasizing that any “armed action or activity outside the military institution is deemed condemnable and an unlawful endeavor that jeopardizes the national interest.” While the strikes are the first in Iraq since attacks on US and coalition forces began, they are the fourth US strike against targets associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps since the attacks started on October 17. The first strike occurred on October 26 when an F-15 fighter and two F-16 fighter jets targeted two weapons and ammunition storage facilities in Abu Kamal, Syria. Then on November 8, two F-15s carried out an airstrike on a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria. On November 12, the US carried out more airstrikes on a training facility and a safe house affiliated with the IRGC. As of Tuesday there have been at least 66 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, including several on forces at Al-Asad. Earlier in the day on Monday before the ballistic missile attack, a US official said a one-way drone attack was also launched against forces at Al-Asad, which resulted in no casualties or infrastructure damage. As of last week, at least 56 US troops had sustained minor injuries in the attacks since October 17 — at least 25 of them being traumatic brain injuries — and all had since returned to duty. It’s unclear if an AC-130 has been used to respond to attacks in this way since October 17, though a US official said the US has returned fire on hostile forces multiple times. “We have had other cases where we have responded in retaliation when we were able to identify the point of origin,” Singh said. The attacks on US and coalition forces started after Hamas’ attack on Israel, and the Pentagon has maintained that the US has been successful in deterring any escalatory actions that would expand the conflict outside of Israel and Gaza despite the continued attacks on US forces. “Is deterrence working? We feel that it is,” Singh told reporters last week. “We have not seen this war spread into a wider regional conflict. We have … conducted three different strikes. We responded most recently this weekend. And again, we will always reserve the right to respond at a time and place of our choosing in the future.” This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.

Biden campaign targets two key battleground states with ads during Thanksgiving Day football game," The Biden campaign has drawn up a blitz of Thanksgiving Day advertisements in two key battleground states, airing a pair of TV spots during the Detroit Lions-Green Bay Packers NFL game this week. Two ads highlighting President Joe Biden’s economic record will air during Thursday’s game in the Detroit and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, media markets, the campaign said in an announcement shared first with CNN. It’s a move aimed at putting some points on the board with a general election audience, the campaign said, with the game “expected to reach 1.1 million adults over the age of 35 and 850,000 households in the Detroit market alone.” As Republicans duke it out in the primary, Biden’s campaign is looking down field to next November, and voters in Michigan and Wisconsin where these ads are running will be critical to Biden’s electoral map. In Michigan, Biden defeated Trump by 2.8 percentage points in 2020 while in Wisconsin, Biden won by a narrower margin – .6 percentage points. But polling released earlier this month indicates Biden’s support could be slipping in those midwestern swing states. In a New York Times–Siena College poll of Michigan voters, 43% chose Biden, compared to 48% for Trump. In Wisconsin, Biden narrowly edged out Trump, 47% to 45%. The Thanksgiving Day ad placement is part of the campaign’s $25 million ad buy announced in August and marks its latest play to reach battleground state voters during football games. One of the ads discusses Biden’s middle-class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, making an argument that acknowledges ongoing economic strain. The ad, titled “Never Left” points to the president’s work to bring down costs on drug pricing, scale back health insurance premiums, and invest in clean energy to lower power costs. Another ad, titled “Finally,” highlights the administration’s efforts to lower prescription drug costs. Biden, the narrator says in one ad, “knows what life is like for working people. And knows middle class life is too expensive right now.” “For Joe Biden, it’s about restoring the sense of security working people deserve. That simple promise. That peace of mind. He’s determined to get it back – because of where he’s from and who he is,” the narrator says. “This Thanksgiving as Americans come together, we are proud to highlight how President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the issues that matter most to American families and delivering real tangible results that are lowering costs for everyday Americans,” said Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. The Biden team kicked off this effort in September by running TV ads during the NFL season opener between the Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs. Those ads ran in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In all, the Biden campaign has made more than 90 ad placements around NFL and college football programing totaling more than $1.17 million dollars, a campaign official says. That has included an ad hitting former President Donald Trump on manufacturing during a Chicago Bears-Carolina Panthers game earlier this month as well as a veterans-focused ad during a Penn State football game and Packers-Pittsburgh Steelers game on Veterans Day. The campaign also ran an ad targeting Black voters during a Colorado-USC football game in September. The campaign has also looked to appeal to Latino voters through a “Spanglish” ad that aired during a September Sunday Night Football game between the Miami Dolphins and the New England Patriots. The campaign has sought to use these highly watched television events to push their campaign message to a politically diverse audience. The campaign has pointed to data from Nielsen Prime Lingo showing 47% of presidential election voters saying they watched a Lions game on TV in the last 12 months, including 50% of Democrats, 53% of Republican and 43% of independents. The ads that will run during this week’s Lions-Packers game come as the campaign hopes to change the minds of voters who feel the president is fumbling his handling of the economy.

"A futuristic airport terminal, a fish passage and ski town bus lanes: Infrastructure projects funded by the bipartisan law"," More than 40,000 projects have received federal funding from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden two yeas ago. But many Americans may not have noticed the impact of the historic investment just yet. Construction hasn’t started in many places and signs of the nation’s aging infrastructure continue to make the news. Just this year, Vermont’s roadways were no match for historic rainfall that stranded residents and shut down businesses, and a train derailment in Ohio spewed poisonous fumes into the air and killed thousands of fish. The Biden administration is eager to show the impact the law – which garnered bipartisan support in Congress – is having ahead of the 2024 election, putting up signs along roadways claiming credit for projects across the country and billboards celebrating the two-year anniversary. The law provides funding not only for roads and bridges, but also to create a nationwide network of electric vehicle chargers, increase access to high-speed internet, improve public transportation and upgrade ports. It’s too early to know the full impact the additional infrastructure spending will have on the US economy. The federal government has until 2026 to disburse the money, and some massive projects will take more time to be completed. Here are five projects that have received money from the law so far: A bright red, spaceship-looking Terminal E reopened earlier this year at Boston Logan International Airport after undergoing a number of renovations, with funding assistance from a $62 million grant from the infrastructure law. Construction at Terminal E began in 2019, prior to the law’s passage, adding four new gates. Upgrades were also made to the HVAC system, the ticket area, the baggage claim area and jet bridges. Some of the federal grant is also being used to improve the arrival roadways for Terminals A and E and the roadway between Terminals C and E. The airport received the grant last year from the infrastructure law’s Airport Terminals Program, which will award $1 billion each year for five years. The I-39/90/94 bridge that spans the Wisconsin River in Columbia County will be replaced with two new bridge spans thanks to $80 million from the federal infrastructure law. Construction is expected to begin next year. The bridge is nearing the end of its “operational life,” according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Two overcrossing bridges for county roads U and V will also be replaced. About 23% of the current bridge traffic is composed of trucks, since the route links economic hubs like Milwaukee, Chicago and Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison, which is about a 45-minute drive to the south of the I-39/90/94 bridge. The route also connects major tourism destinations, with a large share of Wisconsin’s tourism revenue coming from nearby counties. The bridge is one of the few that cross the Wisconsin River in the southeast part of the state, according to the Wisconsin DOT. Free electric bus service is already provided through Park City, a popular Utah ski town. The trip, which runs from the historic district to the Kimball Junction neighborhood, is intended to take 10 to 15 minutes. But the buses are delayed about one-third of the time due to traffic congestion. To make the route more efficient, local officials have been considering adding dedicated bus lanes along State Route 224 since 2018. Earlier this year, the project received $25 million from the infrastructure law. Construction is expected to start next year. In addition to creating two 12-foot-wide lanes — one running in each direction — there are plans to build two new bus stations, upgrade three existing stations and purchase five more electric buses. Billions of dollars from the infrastructure package are going to dozens of projects that will improve train travel along the nation’s busy Northeast corridor between Boston and Washington, DC. One major project receiving funds is the rail tunnel that runs under the Hudson River, connecting New Jersey with Manhattan. First opened in 1910, the tunnel has several age-related problems and also suffered damage when Hurricane Sandy inundated the tubes with salt water in 2012. Separately, in Maryland, initial construction began in March to replace the 150-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, which runs under the city of Baltimore. It will ultimately be replaced with two new tubes for Amtrak and Maryland Area Regional Commuter, or MARC, trains. The improvements are expected to increase train speeds in the tunnel from 30 mph to 110 mph. The Susquehanna River Bridge in Maryland and the Connecticut River Bridge – both of which are more than 100 years old – will also be replaced. The infrastructure law allocated $22 billion to Amtrak directly, some of which is being used to replace its fleet of more than 1,000 railcars and locomotives. Some of the new cars have already entered service. The Howard A. Hanson Dam has protected Washington’s Green River Valley from flooding since it was constructed in 1961, but it’s also putting Chinook and Coho salmon and steelhead populations at risk. Earlier this year, the US Army Corps of Engineers received $220 million from the infrastructure law to complete work on a fish-passage facility that will help fish navigate around the dam, reopening more than 60 miles of habitat. Washington’s lawmakers have been requesting federal funds for the project for several years. Growing the salmon and steelhead fish populations will help support the endangered “Southern resident” killer whales that are found mostly off British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. The fish passage is also expected to help maintain the water supply to the Tacoma Public Utility. “A new downstream fish passage facility at Howard Hanson Dam is the single most impactful project that (the US Army Corps of Engineers) can take to benefit Puget Sound salmon and orca recovery without negatively impacting other user groups,” Seattle District Commander Col. Alexander L. Bullock said in a statement last year.",US Politics
"Inside the painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the US and Qatar to free 50 hostages"," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu grabbed Brett McGurk’s arm as he walked out of a tense meeting of the Israeli Cabinet over securing the release of hostages Hamas was holding in Gaza. “We need this deal,” Netanyahu told the White House Middle East coordinator a week ago in Tel Aviv, according to sources familiar with the exchange. Earlier that day, Netanyahu and President Joe Biden had agreed over the phone that they were ready to accept the broad contours of a deal for Hamas to release 50 women and children who were being held hostage. A major breakthrough had come two days earlier on November 12. Hamas – after refusing for days – had relented in offering identifying information about several dozen hostages, such as their age, gender and nationalities. The information confirmed that numerous children and toddlers had been taken captive on October 7. Even though Israel and the US believed there were more than 50 women and children hostages, both sides agreed that they needed to move ahead with securing the release of those 50 – and hope that the deal might incentivize Hamas to release more after the initial group. But hours after McGurk’s meeting with Netanyahu, everything went dark. The Qataris – who had been playing the main mediating role – couldn’t get a hold of Hamas. When the group finally resurfaced, Hamas threatened to derail the talks: It demanded that the Israel Defense Forces, which had gone in to raid Al-Shifa hospital, leave the hospital grounds. IDF declined but indicated that it would keep the hospital running. Once the talks resumed, Biden – who was in San Francisco having just finished a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping – placed one more call to the emir of Qatar. His message: Time was up. The emir gave Biden his assurances that he would do everything possible to close the deal. The next day, McGurk met in person with the emir in Doha to examine the text of the final deal that by this point was around half a dozen pages long. It laid out how women and children would leave in the first phase, as well as incentives for Hamas to release more hostages beyond that. CIA Director Bill Burns was dialed in to the meeting by phone. Israel’s war cabinet approved the deal after making minor changes on Sunday, and the text of the agreement was passed on to Hamas for the last time by the emir of Qatar. The emir made clear: This is the final offer. On Tuesday morning, Hamas responded to their Qatari interlocutors: They approved the deal. While efforts to negotiate a deal began in the immediate days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, the groundwork for the deal started coming together weeks later, after the Biden administration had confidence that communication with Hamas via the Qataris was effective. Officials would later describe this as their “pilot” negotiation. On October 23, the White House had successfully secured the release of two American citizens from Gaza – Natalie and Judith Raanan. As the mother and daughter made their way across Gaza, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer and McGurk were huddled in Sullivan’s office, tracking the Raanans’ movements in real time. Sources described their multi-hour journey as “excruciating.” When the women arrived at the border, Charge d’Affaires Stephanie Hallett was waiting for them. At this point, Biden placed a call to Natalie Raanan’s father to share the joyful news, and later in the day, he would speak with both women. That day would serve as proof to Biden’s top national security officials that the White House had successfully established a means of communicating and negotiating with Hamas via Qatar. And it triggered what would ultimately become the weeks-long effort to secure the release of a larger group of hostages. After the Israelis delegated the director of Mossad to negotiate on the hostages, back in the US, Burns, too, became intimately involved. In Doha, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani engaged directly with senior Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, a person familiar with the discussions said. In multiple phone calls in October, Biden impressed upon Netanyahu that there was a path for a large group of hostages to be released. On October 24, Hamas appeared to agree to the parameters of a deal to release women and children hostages. American and Israeli officials furiously deliberated whether Israel should delay its ground invasion. Ultimately, Israel wasn’t convinced. At this point, they still had no proof of life of any of the hostages that Hamas claimed to have, and they also didn’t buy Hamas’ claim that they couldn’t determine the identities of the hostages until there was a pause in fighting. Israel began its ground invasion on October 27. In the weeks that followed, the US, Israel and Qatar went back and forth with Hamas, negotiating with the group about every detail of a possible deal: the timeframe, number of hostages, safe passage corridors and surveillance. Blinken returned to Israel in early November to press the Israeli government to accept “humanitarian pauses,” something that the US argued would advance progress on the hostages. Although there was an agreement in principle after Blinken met with Netanyahu and the war cabinet, the Israeli prime minister publicly rejected the idea just hours after that meeting. It took days of pressure from the US for the Israeli government to institute and acknowledge “tactical pauses.” The talks at times seemed to move painfully slow, as each step of the communication moved from Doha, Qatar, or Cairo to Hamas in Gaza, then back again, before being relayed to Israel and the US. “Every step of this is like pulling teeth,” one official said at the time. Behind the scenes, the hostages were the key issue that prevented Israel from initially agreeing to a humanitarian pause, because the Israeli government did not want to signal any kind of relief in exchange for hostages, a senior State Department official said. Numerous different permutations of a deal were discussed. Israeli and US officials initially insisted that all women and children come out in the first part of the release. Hamas would only guarantee 50 and refused to produce identifying information about the hostages. By the time that Burns met in Doha with the emir of Qatar and David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, the fact that there was no identifying information about the hostages was a major sticking point. On November 12, Biden informed the emir of Qatar that the negotiation could not move forward without this information in what a senior administration official described as a “very important and very intense call.” Shortly after, Hamas finally relented, seemingly guaranteeing that any final deal would entail the release of 50 women and children hostages. While the deal reached this week only returns 50 women and children, US officials projected confidence Tuesday that the agreement will ultimately pave the way for additional hostage releases. There are 10 Americans who remain unaccounted for, including two women and a 3-year-old girl. Pressed by CNN on the remaining Americans, a senior administration official said the White House remains “determined to get everybody home,” and suggested that the deal is structured to “very much (incentivize) the release of everybody.” An agreement to release hostages from Hamas would “unlock the potential for delivery of more humanitarian assistance” into Gaza, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday. After their safe passage, the released hostages will be given medical attention in Israel, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, suggesting that some could have longer-term medical needs following six weeks in “abhorrent conditions.” Then there will be efforts to repatriate citizens to their home countries and connect them with their families. For any American citizens released, Kirby said, after medical care is prioritized, the US State Department will provide consular assistance. It could be 24 to 48 hours before the Biden administration has confirmation as to whether the two American women and orphaned American 3-year-old were among those released, one US official said.

"Republican Celeste Maloy will win House special election in Utah, CNN projects"," Republican Celeste Maloy will win the special election Tuesday for Utah’s 2nd Congressional District, CNN projects, filling the only remaining vacancy in the US House of Representatives. With Maloy’s victory, House Republicans will return to a 222-213 majority, giving Speaker Mike Johnson some breathing room as he faces a looming government spending fight, though he still controls only a very narrow majority. But that may be temporary, with members weighing a possible expulsion of Republican Rep. George Santos. Maloy will defeat Democratic state Sen. Kathleen Riebe in the reliably red district that covers the western portion of the state, stretching from the Salt Lake City area to St. George. She will succeed her onetime boss, former GOP Rep. Chris Stewart, and will be the first woman in Utah’s congressional delegation since Republican Mia Love left office in 2019. Stewart left office in September over his wife’s health concerns. Maloy, who worked as a counsel in Stewart’s Washington office, had his endorsement on her way to securing the GOP nod. She advanced to the September primary by winning a nominating convention in June. She then won a three-way primary contest, besting former state Rep. Becky Edwards and former Utah GOP Chairman Bruce Hough. Maloy faced questions over her eligibility for the special election primary ballot related to voter registration issues. She was marked inactive in the state’s voter database because she did not cast a ballot in 2020 and 2022, according to The Salt Lake Tribune, after she relocated to Virginia to work for Stewart. But the state GOP submitted her name for the ballot, noting that no objections to her candidacy were filed before the convention. On the campaign trail, Maloy often touted her experience as a congressional aide to make the case that she has already been serving the district. “Congress is struggling right now. Things aren’t going smoothly,” Maloy said at a debate last month. “We really need somebody to get into this seat who knows how Congress works, who knows how to work with people and who already knows this district.” Maloy, who also made government spending a focus of her campaign, will join a Congress staring down two deadlines in January and February to keep the government funded. “I’m willing to vote for a spending bill that reduces spending,” Maloy said at the debate when asked whether she would support bipartisan government funding legislation. “As long as we’re cutting spending and moving in the right direction, there’s no need to shut down the government.” A sizable minority of House Republicans did not back the stopgap measure enacted last week to keep the government open because it did not include the deep spending cuts that conservatives had demanded and instead extended funding at current levels.",US Politics
Former Trump Org. controller breaks down in tears on witness stand in fraud trial," After four days of testimony and two trips to the witness stand, former Trump Organization controller Jeff McConney broke down in tears on Tuesday, telling the court the toll of the numerous investigations and accusations of misconduct drove him to leave the company he loved working for after 35 years. “I just couldn’t do it anymore,” McConney said. “I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for.” The emotional outcry came when Jesus Suarez, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, asked McConney before the lunch break why he left the Trump Org. Before answering the question McConney took a long pause, removed his glasses, and threw his arms in the air. Trump attorney Alina Habba motioned to a court officer to bring him a box of tissues. Judge Arthur Engoron gave her a thumbs up. He apologized for his emotional reaction, “Sorry.” The former long-time Trump Org. controller, who is a co-defendant in the civil fraud trial, said being subjected to several subpoenas and testifying in connection to multiple government cases accusing him of wrongdoing had taken a toll on him. Pausing at times to wipe his eyes, McConney gave a lengthy answer describing his love for working for the company and ​said he​ remains proud of his 35-year career. “I feel proud of what I did. I think everything was justified. Numbers don’t represent fully what these assets are worth,” McConney said. “I got to do a lot of things normally an accountant wouldn’t be able to do. I’m very proud of the work I did for 35 years.” But after several years of investigations accusing him of inflating asset valuations on Trump’s financial statements, he grew frustrated and said, “I gave up.” McConney acknowledged on cross examination that he’s received all but $125,000 of a $500,000 severance package from Trump Org. Assistant New York Attorney General Andrew Amer pushed back on McConney’s testimony that it was the outside accounting firm Mazars that wrote most of the notes and disclaimers on Trump’s personal financial statements. McConney, under questioning from a Trump attorney on Monday, shifted the blame to Mazars and Donald Bender, ​who he says reviewed and could have advised them about any inflated asset values on Trump’s personal financial statements that are at the heart of the civil fraud trial. Amer showed McConney a collection of his own handwritten edits on the statement drafts that he had attributed to Mazars in earlier testimony. At one point while reviewing his own handwritten notes, McConney acknowledged his memory was “incorrect” about a specific disclosure on Trump’s statement. Seeing the handwritten edits also published in the final statement version, he acknowledged he must have primarily written the disclosure about asset valuations that deviated from generally accepted accounting principles. Amer also suggested McConney was involved in the financial statements as recently as 2021 although he testified earlier at trial that he passed off the duty to another accounting executive Patrick Birney around 2016. Amer showed the court handwritten notations from McConney on 2021 financial statement drafts. Among the 2021 notes, the former controller wrote that Eric Trump needed to review the footnotes for the section on club facilities. On another page McConney wrote that Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr, both defendants in the case, should review the statements. McConney eventually said, “I had a little bit of input.” McConney said he did the best he could to make the notes on his spreadsheets accurate “to let the reader of the spreadsheet know where the numbers were coming from.” The trial will resume Monday after the Thanksgiving break with Trump Hotels CFO Mark Hawthorn expected to testify. Deutsche Bank lenders who worked with Trump Org. on several loans at issue in this case are expected to testify under subpoena next Tuesday.",US Politics
"Hostage families welcome first, precarious hopes after Israel-Hamas deal"," The Gaza hostage deal represents a rare moment of humanity in a savage conflict that has inflicted unfathomable violence on both Israeli and Palestinian civilians. For the child and female hostages expected to be released during a pause in the fighting and their families, it represents everything — a chance of life seven weeks after a Hamas terror attack on Israeli soil slaughtered 1,200 people. There were growing hopes, for example, on Tuesday night that American Avigail Idan, who turns four on Friday and whose mother and father were murdered in the attacks on October 7, could be among the first released. “I am very hopeful, our family is hopeful, it’s been 45 days since (Avigail) was abducted and taken to Gaza,” her great aunt Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “It’s excruciating. For our family, we have spent the last seven weeks – seven weeks – worrying, wondering, praying, hoping.” The hours to come will be agonizing for loved ones waiting for their relatives – and even more so for those whose family members are not on the list to be freed in this preliminary arrangement. Much remains uncertain, including when the pause will start, how and when hostages will start to emerge and if the agreement will last. The complex agreement was brokered by Qatar, which served as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel in exhaustive negotiations with the close involvement of the United States, and was endorsed by the Israeli cabinet early Wednesday local time. It will likely require similar attention from all involved to implement in a vicious war zone and it will be at risk of unravelling at any moment. This is because of a vacuum of trust between two bitter enemies and the extreme logistical challenges of extracting hostages from a territory that waited weeks for the arrival of a few aid trucks amid a raging Israeli offensive. The carefully choreographed plan would see the release of at least 50 women and children held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for a four-day truce in Israel’s air and ground campaign against the Islamist group, an Israel government statement said. The announcement also held out the potential for the truce to extend beyond the original four-day period, given that an extra day could be added for each 10 additional hostages available for release. Hamas said in a statement that 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Nothing is certain until the hostages start coming out. And the sequencing of the agreement means there will be a constant risk of incidents that could disrupt it. But the weeks of negotiations at least proved that intense diplomatic efforts can accomplish something concrete, even if the agreement is far from the ceasefire that Israel’s critics are demanding internationally after a conflict that produced harrowing scenes of Israeli kids killed in their beds and Palestinian hospitals under Israeli fire. The deal is the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the Hamas attacks, and may temporarily ease some of the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose legacy will now be forever tarnished by October 7. The White House will greet the deal as a significant victory and a first success after weeks of painstaking personal engagement by President Joe Biden and top foreign policy and intelligence officials that threatened to go nowhere. Biden held multiple phone calls with Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. His envoy, Brett McGurk, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were intimately involved in the region. The Israeli leader said Tuesday that the president had been responsible for improving the deal at critical moments. The agreement, even if it fully delivers on its potential, is unlikely to permanently ease Netanyahu’s tenuous political plight. He’s trapped between the extreme right-wing coalition members he chose as a last resort to cling to power and an Israeli public that blames him for the Hamas attacks. And Biden has already absorbed considerable domestic political damage for his steadfast support for the Israeli response. Heart-rending video of civilian carnage in Gaza has caused some young and Arab American voters in the Democratic base to revolt, furthering weakening Biden’s shaky electoral coalition with his reelection race heating up. The impending hostage release deal is also the latest example of Qatar’s capacity to play on all sides of a treacherous regional power game. Home to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the oil rich Arab nation also hosts a vast US air base that is critical to American national security – a duality that reflects the Emirate’s emerging role as a Middle Eastern power with wider aspirations. There will be some hope that the agreement, if honored by both sides, could lead to further breakthroughs and improve the prospects for more hostages still captive in Gaza. Their continued incarceration – presumably in dark tunnels beneath the war-torn enclave – tempered the sense of euphoria about those who are expected to be freed. The first step for the precarious agreement will be gathering the hostages and facilitating their transfer and initiating the pause in fighting and the entry into Gaza of humanitarian aid under the deal. The potential for snags is ever present. As Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli peace activist who once acted as a channel to Hamas, put it on Tuesday: “You have to remember Israel is negotiating with people who it intends to kill — there is no trust between the parties.” The hostage breakthrough – and the expected release of a fraction of those captured by Hamas on October 7 – raises the question of what happens to those left behind. The answer will be tough for their loved ones to hear. “If it took this long to get women and children out, what does it look like for the Israeli soldiers that are being held?” said Christopher O’Leary, a former US government director of hostage recovery. “It could be a very protracted period that they are held, which is why going back on offensive military operations after this tactical pause is going to be required,” O’Leary told CNN International’s Richard Quest. Even so, international expectations might subtly shift during the truce, making a resumption of Israel’s offensive harder than Netanyahu might wish. Longer term, hopes that a broader peace initiative could grow from this small first step risk being undercut by the searing reality of the conflict. Israel believes it is fighting an existential war not just for its national survival but for that of the Jewish people. Hamas fighters in Gaza are fighting against obliteration or embracing martyrdom and while the group’s leaders might seek to leverage remaining hostages for thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails, the most likely scenario is a fight to the finish in Gaza after the pause ends. This would inevitably mean new Israel Defense Force advances on Palestinian population centers and more deaths among trapped civilians that will further exacerbate the brittle international situation inside Israel, the US and elsewhere. “There is no scenario to end this war without Israel making sure Hamas is no longer in control of their territory. That means killing all their operatives and their leaders, their political and military leaders,” Baskin told CNN Max.",US Politics
Trump’s gag order appeal previews America’s grave election year stress test," Donald Trump may have found his “heads-I-win, tails-you-lose” legal challenge. However the ex-president’s appeal ends against a limited gag order imposed in his federal election subversion case, he can expect a benefit. If Trump prevails – or the three judges who heard the case Monday narrow the terms of the restriction – he may gain new leeway to attack special counsel Jack Smith’s case against him. If Trump loses, as seems likely given the tone of the hearing, he will have a new talking point for his narrative that he’s being persecuted to destroy his 2024 campaign. A judgment in Trump’s favor on the gag order – which has been temporarily frozen while the appeal is heard – would pale against his four criminal trials and his current civil fraud trial in New York. But the issue, and Monday’s hearing, provided a preview of the extreme institutional stress, political tensions and grave constitutional questions ahead next year when the most recent president and possible GOP nominee fights for his liberty in multiple courtrooms while battling to win back the White House. It’s hard to see how the legal system escapes the fate of other institutions of accountability whose images have been tarnished after seeking to contain or expose the ex-president’s unique brand of rule breaking. The gag order appeal is entwined with complex arguments on the breadth of the First Amendment and the extent to which courts have the right to regulate its scope in order to protect their officers and proceedings and the administration of justice. The takeaway from Monday’s arguments was that the three judges – all appointed by Democrats – appear likely to largely restore the limited gag order on Trump imposed by Judge Tanya Chutkan. The restrictions prevented Trump from attacking court staff, prosecutors or potential witnesses verbally or on social media. But they didn’t stop him from venting about the judge, the Justice Department, the case more generally or his potential general election foe, President Joe Biden. Trump’s legal team argued that any restrictions on his comments represent an unconstitutional assault on his rights to freedom of political speech. But the judges must decide the extent to which those rights can be curtailed for a criminal defendant — who in this case allegedly attempted to thwart the 2020 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and maintained no wrongdoing in all of the cases against him. The case is complicated by the fact that Trump’s lambasting of Smith as “a lunatic,” for example, is more serious than just whining over his treatment. It fits into a long-term effort to delegitimize the justice system itself. DC Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett made this point when she told Trump’s counsel, D. John Sauer, that labeling all of Trump’s utterances “‘core political speech’ begs the question of whether it is in fact political speech, or whether it is political speech aimed at derailing or corrupting the criminal justice process.” Trump’s legal arguments also appear to be touching on another vital question: does his status as a politician offers him an extra layer of protection? His lawyers argued that the restrictions were even more unjustified given that they were imposed during “a hotly contested campaign for the highest office in the United States of America.” This presents the judges with a tough balancing act in a case that does not just bear on the capacity of courts to protect fair trials but also touches on the integrity of the electoral system. An overly restrictive order could hamper Trump’s capacity to repel political attacks against his candidacy – especially since his campaign is so intertwined with his legal fight. And the decision the judges make could echo for years to come and affect future political candidates. But at the same time, the implication that a political candidate could be allowed to intimidate witnesses on social media in a manner that a regular citizen would not raises another perennial question in Trump’s legal cases – of equality under the law and whether he’s seeking special treatment simply because of who he is. “There are many legal questions we have talked about in the context of Donald Trump over the years (and) nothing is harder for judges to sort out than the First Amendment and these free speech issues,” said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst. “At some point, a judge has to step in and almost arbitrarily decide what is okay and what isn’t. They were clearly grappling with this over hours and hours.” Given the tightrope the judges are walking, it’s hard to see how these questions can be fully answered without some ensuing damage to US institutions. But Trump’s willingness to open them shows that, as usual, he’s content to put his political goals over America’s democratic foundation. Trump’s incessant assaults on the judicial process reflect another never-before-seen aspect of a presidential election campaign, which loomed over Monday’s hearing. Because he could be tied up with criminal trials for much of the next year, Trump wants every opportunity to use the legal system as a platform for a political fight. It also gives him a cause that resonates with his most loyal supporters – that he’s defending them from what he spins as a weaponized justice system. The ex-president seems to view such a narrative — ideal for raking in campaign cash he’s partly using to pay his legal bills — as his best shot at creating anger among Republican voters that could help him win reelection. (A second presidency could also equip Trump with the capacity to delay or halt some of the federal cases against him.) The ex-president is already seeking to use the courtroom as a political platform in the civil case against him, his adult sons and his company in New York. In his appearance on the witness stand two weeks ago, Trump infuriated Judge Arthur Engoron with lengthy and political answers to narrow evidential questions. “This is not a political rally. This is a courtroom,” Engoron said at one point. The issue of the gag order in the federal election subversion case also sheds new light on a consistent concern about the impact of Trump’s rhetoric and the extent to which his statements could incite violence. This is, after all, a former president who told his supporters to “fight like Hell” for their country immediately before his mob smashed its way into the US Capitol and tried to halt certification of the election on January 6, 2021. The possibility that Trump’s fierce attacks against potential witnesses, court staff and others could lead to actual harm, even if he is not explicit, seems very real. Only last week, a judge in Colorado argued that the ex-president “engaged in an insurrection” after the last election even while conceding she lacked the power to bar him from the primary ballot in the Rocky Mountain State. The incitement issue is not a hypothetical one in the gag order case. Trump has already attacked former Vice President Mike Pence and the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, multiple times on social media. He even suggested that the recently retired top military officer be executed for treason. Both men could be key witnesses in the federal election subversion case and will therefore be entitled to the protection of the court — even if Trump may consider them fair game as political critics at a time when he’s locked in the heat of a political campaign. History suggests that if Trump loses this appeal, he’ll both brand the outcome as proof of an attempt by the Biden Justice Department to persecute him and seek to elevate the case to a higher court. Given his transactional view of the legal system, he may reason he’d have better luck with the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. But the top bench has not shown much interest in becoming embroiled in many of Trump’s most politicized cases. “I don’t even think they will take it up. I will be very surprised if they do,” said Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer, on CNN Max on Monday, adding that the Supreme Court is “not just your safety valve whenever you get a ruling that you don’t like.” But Moss also suggested that the case will make “a great political talking point if they lose.” That, after all, is the common thread behind many of Trump’s legal appeals, challenges and defenses.",US Politics
This may be Biden’s best hope of reversing his slide with Black and brown voters," President Joe Biden’s weakness in polls among non-White voters is boosting Republican hopes that the GOP is poised to extend its most important political breakthrough of modern times – and potentially to reshape the competition between the two parties along the way. The most consequential political gain for Republicans in recent decades has been their increasing strength among working-class White voters – a process that began under Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in the 1970s and 1980s but peaked in recent years under Donald Trump. Once the brawny backbone of the Democrats’ “New Deal” coalition that dominated American politics from the 1930s until the 1960s, White voters without a college degree have become the foundation of the modern GOP. Now some political observers believe working-class minority voters are moving along the same track – and largely for the same reasons. Just as millions of working-class White voters recoiled from Democratic cultural liberalism during the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s, they argue, working-class Latino and even Black voters are shifting toward the GOP now in rejection of “woke” ideology on issues such as crime, immigration and LGBTQ rights. Such arguments are fueling the increasingly common assertions that Republicans are building a “multiracial populist coalition,” as GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini argues in his copiously researched recent book, “Party of the People.” While “the rightward shift” of White- and non-White voters without a college degree toward the GOP in the Trump years “might seem like two discrete, unrelated events …the two groups share a common working-class DNA and their political shifts stem from the same root,” Ruffini writes. A wide array of recent polls shows Biden with an unusually small lead for a Democrat among both Black and Latino voters in a potential 2024 rematch with Trump. But many analysts say it’s less clear that Democrats are facing a lasting structural realignment among those voters – much less a change rooted in a long-term cultural alienation from the party – rather than immediate dissatisfaction with the economy under Biden. “I keep looking for it as well, but you are not seeing as much evidence for a culture war driving any kind of change at this moment,” said Carlos Odio, senior vice president for research at Equis Research, a Democratic polling firm that specializes in Latino voters. “What’s driving Trump and the Republicans is the economy. At the end of the day, ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ over and over again.” If anything, rather than cultural alienation driving working-class non-White voters toward the GOP, continuing resistance in those communities to Republican priorities on many culturally and racially tinged issues may be Democrats’ best hope in 2024 of recapturing non-White voters disenchanted with Biden’s performance and the economy. Despite all the discontent over Biden, almost three-fifths of non-White voters without a college degree agreed that the “Republican Party has been taken over by racists,” in a recent national survey by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, according to previously unpublished results provided to CNN. The stakes in this struggle are enormous. White voters without a college degree, now the electorate’s most Republican-leaning group, have been steadily shrinking as a share of the total vote at a rate of about 2 to 3 percentage points in each presidential election for decades. To offset that decline, Republicans need to find votes elsewhere. The party is facing resistance among college-educated White voters, many of whom have recoiled from the hard-edged cultural and racial views the party has embraced under Trump. To strategists like Ruffini, the most plausible path for the GOP to remain competitive over time is to grow its vote among non-White voters, especially those without college degrees. “With the Republicans’ strongest group” of White voters without a college degree “shrinking and their weakest set of groups growing, Republicans will need to increase their support levels across all parts of the multiracial populist coalition just to keep pace with where they are today,” Ruffini writes in his engaging new book. All data sources about voting behavior agree that the GOP has improved its performance among minority voters without a college degree over the past decade. For many observers perhaps the most surprising result in the 2020 election was Trump’s improvement among those voters after four years in which he frequently appealed to White racial resentments and pursued militant immigration policies, such as separating children from their parents at the border. The exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN found that Trump’s vote among non-White voters without a college degree increased from just 20% in 2016 to 26% in 2020. Research by Catalist, a Democratic voter targeting firm whose analyses are respected in both parties, found that Trump’s vote among Latino voters without a college degree spiked from 61% in 2016 to 72% in 2020; Trump also enjoyed a modest 3 percentage point gain among Black voters without a college degree over that period, Catalist found. Exactly why Trump made those gains, though, remains a matter of dispute – with important implications for 2024 and beyond. Advocates of the realignment theory argue that Trump’s gains represented an ideological rejection of Democrats among centrist and right-leaning minority voters, prompted partly by their opposition to the calls to “defund the police” in the racial justice protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. They pointed to evidence in exit polls that a much higher percentage of minority voters who identified as conservative voted for Trump in 2020 than in 2016. But many others, such as Odio, believe Trump’s 2020 non-White improvement was grounded in the belief that he was more qualified to run the economy. Those in this camp believe the key factor for many working-class minority voters was Trump’s determination to quickly reopen the economy after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Somewhat to the surprise of both parties, the movement of non-college-educated minority voters toward the GOP stalled in the 2022 midterm election, even though those voters expressed widespread disenchantment with the economy and Biden’s performance. In Catalist’s analysis, Democrats won a slightly higher percentage of Latinos without a college degree in the 2022 House races than they did in the 2020 presidential contest. Most important for Democrats, Senate incumbents Mark Kelly in Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada – probably the two states where Latino voters are most important for the party – also ran slightly better among non-college-educated Latinos than Biden did in their states, according to previously unpublished Catalist results provided to CNN. (The exit polls, differing slightly, showed a small further national gain in 2022 for the GOP among non-White voters without a college degree.) Odio, though, warns that Democrats can only take so much comfort from their 2022 success among minority voters, particularly those without college degrees. The reason, he says, is that the openness toward Trump and the GOP has been most pronounced among economically marginal Latino voters who are largely disconnected from the political system and much less likely to turn out in a midterm than presidential year election. “So much of the dynamism and volatility in the Latino vote is among less frequent voters,” Odio said. “So in important ways, you almost have to clear 2022 out of your mind.” Some Democratic strategists who focus on Black voters believe the same is true in that community. The swarm of recent polls showing Biden leading Trump only narrowly with Latino and Black voters has prompted a new wave of concern about the party’s position in minority communities. Especially ominous for Democrats is the large share of both Latino and Black voters in multiple polls who say Biden’s economic policies have not helped them and/or say they trust Trump more than Biden to manage the economy. Daron Shaw, a Republican pollster and University of Texas political scientist who co-conducted a recent large national survey of Latino voters for Univision, says that those attitudes mean “there is absolutely an opening” for Trump or another GOP nominee to advance further with non-White voters in 2024. Just as many White working-class voters “felt like the financial crisis of ’08-‘09 left them rudderless [and] eroded their position in American society … both on economic grounds and on cultural grounds, there are voters within the Latino community as well, who feel no one is representing them,” Shaw said during a press call about the Univision poll. The risk to Democrats, Shaw argued, is that some of those working-class Latino voters believe the party is distracted by what he sees as cultural causes, such as LGBTQ rights, and “is not as interested” in their bread-and-butter economic concerns “as they have been” previously. Sergio Garcia-Rios, a University of Texas political scientist who partnered with Shaw on the Univision poll, said the Latinos supporting Trump are drawn to him mostly on economic grounds. “To those who are voting for Trump, they remember that in 2016-’17-‘18 the economy worked better,” he said. “You and I can disagree with them on whether or not that is true. But that’s what they remember.” Several grassroots organizers who work in minority communities told me that their experience in 2022 demonstrated that Democrats can win an economic argument even among minority voters who feel squeezed by the cost of living under Biden. Melissa Morales, founder and president of Somos Votantes, a group that mobilizes Latino voters, said Cortez Masto’s victory last year showed that Democrats can survive discontent about the economy if they convince voters they are pursuing policies to help them make ends meet. The key for Biden, she said, is to show Latinos, “‘Here’s what I am doing to try to make this better. We are creating better jobs, I am working actively to lower prices.’ If Biden can present that to voters, there is still an opening here. The fact that costs are high isn’t the end game – it’s what are you going to do about that that voters are looking for.” Similarly, Matt Morrison – executive director of Working America, a group that politically organizes working-class voters who are not in unions – said the organization’s experience in 2022 showed that there remains “a critical difference” between White and non-White voters without a college degree. In the group’s door-to-door or phone canvassing efforts, he said, they’ve typically had far more success moving working-class Black and Latino voters to support Democratic candidates around an economic message than they have at persuading White voters at similar education and income levels. Even when organizers can win an economic argument with working-class White voters, he said, those voters often still remain dubious of Democrats because they believe the party favors minorities. That second barrier doesn’t exist with voters of color, Morrison said. “When you communicate to Black and brown voters, they are far more likely to come back to Democrats,” Morrison said. “They lack that social glue that makes them say, ‘I am of a different tribe.’” Even so, the depth of discontent about the economy among minority voters is likely to remain a crucial hurdle for Biden. Democrats are accustomed to winning at least 7 in 10 minority voters in presidential elections; even if inflation continues to subside, it seems highly unlikely by Election Day that 7 in 10 minority voters will put more faith in Biden than a Republican to manage the economy. That means if Biden is to match, or even approach, Democrats’ historic performance among minority voters, he’ll need other issues to convert some who are dubious about his economic record. And resistance to the GOP’s priorities on cultural and racially tinged issues probably offers him the best opportunity. Those who assert that minorities are abandoning the Democratic Party on cultural grounds often point to the large share of non-White voters who express broad views about US society more often associated with Republicans. Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic electoral analyst who has become an unflinching critic of the party’s policies on social issues, has noted, for instance, that most Latinos agree with statements asserting the US is the greatest country in the world and reject the idea that racism is embedded in American institutions. “It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Democrats’ emphasis on social and democracy issues, while catnip to some socially liberal, educated voters, leaves many working-class and Hispanic voters cold,” writes Teixeira, co-author of the recent book, “Where Have All The Democrats Gone?,” which makes similar arguments as Ruffini. Yet as polling by the Public Religion Research Institute, Univision and other groups show, on many of the actual cultural policies dominating political debate, most minority voters – including most of those without a college degree – align with Democrats, not Republicans. Among non-White voters without a college degree, 57% support legal abortion, 55% back same sex-marriage, and 64% oppose placing barriers at the US border to deter migrants, according to unpublished results from the PRRI’s latest national American Values Survey provided to CNN. (Support for Democratic positions is even greater among non-White voters with a college degree, PRRI found.) Other surveys have found preponderant support among minorities for banning assault weapons and lopsided opposition to ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, as Trump and other GOP candidates have proposed. Maybe most significantly, in PRRI polling, about three-fifths of non-White voters without a college degree agree the GOP has been “taken over by racists,” as do nearly two-thirds of non-White voters with a degree. By contrast, three-fifths of White voters without a college degree reject that idea. Analysts like Odio believe one reason Trump improved among Latinos in 2020 was that he downplayed the harsh language about immigration he used in 2016 and instead emphasized his economic agenda. But Trump has again moved sharply to the right on immigration, pledging mass deportations, internment camps for migrants, the end of birthright citizenship, and military action against Mexico to fight drug cartels. He’s also refused to rule out reinstating his policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border. Latinos in the key states may not yet be aware of Trump’s immigration plans. But Robert P. Jones, president and founder of PRRI, said the group’s polling convinces him that Trump’s agenda on immigration and other cultural issues will ultimately repel some Latino voters otherwise disenchanted with Biden on the economy. “I think we will not know the truth about how much they [Republicans] are overplaying their hand until next summer” if Trump becomes the GOP nominee, Jones said. Some expressions of cultural liberalism – such as the fleeting calls in 2020 to “defund the police” – have clearly rankled working-class minority voters. But Biden never endorsed that idea. And his clearest path to recovering with those voters may be to convince them that the Republican agenda on immigration and other cultural issues threatens their interests and values. Rather than driving further movement toward the GOP among minority voters, in other words, issues such as abortion or immigration may be Biden’s best hope of preventing slippage with those voters. Odio says that in Equis’ polling, the parties are in mirror-image positions with the Latino community. “Among Latinos, Democrats are seen as caring, but there are doubts about their ability to deliver,” he said. “The thought is Republicans might be better at delivering, but there’s an underlying fear they don’t care.” Which side of that equation proves more compelling not only to Latino, but also to Black and other minority working-class voters, will go a long way toward determining whether Biden can win a second term.",US Politics
Polling shows a huge age gap divides the Democratic Party on Israel," President Joe Biden has a problem with the Democratic base when it comes to the Israel-Hamas War. It’s not just that his approval rating on the conflict is lower among Democrats than his overall approval rating. It’s that his base is divided – by age. Younger Democrats are far more likely than older Democrats to view Israel skeptically when it comes to this war as well as the larger geopolitical context. The intra-party age gaps on this question are amongst the largest I’ve ever seen on any important issue. Take a look at a recent Quinnipiac University poll on the topic. Biden’s approval rating for his handling of the Israel-Hamas War among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters is just 56%. Compare that to his 76% approval rating among Democratic voters for his overall job performance. A significant minority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters (36%) disapprove of his handling of the war. Those voters tend to be young. The lion’s share (69%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning younger than 35 disapprove of how Biden is responding to the war. Just 24% approve. It’s the inverse among older Democrats. Most Democrats 65 and older (77%) approve of Biden on this issue. Few (16%) disapprove. The cause of the split is pretty clear when you dig deeper into the data. Biden has been, by most neutral accounts, more sympathetic to Israel than Palestinians during the war. That doesn’t sit well with younger Democrats. When asked which side they sympathize with, Israelis or Palestinians, more, Democrats younger than 35 are far more likely to sympathize with Palestinians (74%) than Israelis (16%). Democrats 65 and older are somewhat more likely to side with Israelis (45%) than Palestinians (25%). The large divide by age causes Democrats and Democratic leaning voters overall to split basically evenly, with 39% sympathizing with Palestinians and 35% with Israelis. This is a massive shift from the beginning of the Israel-Hamas War, when Democrats were more likely to sympathize with Israel by a 48% to 22% margin. That poll was taken in the immediate aftermath of a surprise terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7 that killed about 1,200 people. Since that time, Israel has mounted an offensive in Gaza, and the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says more than 10,000 Palestinians have died. The age breakdown that we’re seeing now, though, goes deeper than just this war or the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians. It comes down to whether Democrats see Israel as a partner. Most Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters (70%) believe that supporting Israel is in the national interest. This includes 87% of those 65 and older. Democrats younger than 35 see things entirely differently. Just 40% think backing Israel is in the national interest of this country. The majority (52%) disagree. Perhaps not surprisingly, these younger Democrats don’t think we should be supplying military aid to Israel in its war with Hamas. A mere 21% agree that we should, while 77% are against it. Older Democrats are for it by a 53% to 32% margin. In total, Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters were 49% in opposition to 44% in support. Voters overall, on the other hand, are 53% in support to 39% opposed for more military aid for Israel. Fissures like these are part of the reason why Biden would have a tough time politically shifting away from Israel. On every question Quinnipiac asked about the conflict, the feelings of the entire electorate were more in-line with the Israeli position (and that of older voters) than the other option given. All voters by a 54% to 24% margin sympathized more with Israelis than Palestinians. Voters, including Democrats, Republicans and independents, by a 73% to 19% margin said backing Israel was in the national interest of America. Biden’s problem is that he likely needs more support from younger voters heading into the 2024 election. He won voters younger than 35 by more than 20 points in 2020. Today, his lead over former President Donald Trump is in the low single digits in an average of recent polling ahead of a potential rematch. It’s not clear that Biden’s handling of the war is causing his decreased backing from younger voters, but it can’t be helping him. The bottom line is Biden finds himself in a political quandary. You can add this to his growing list of problems, as he is only the second incumbent president in the last 80 years to be trailing at this point before the next presidential election. The other is the man he beat three years ago – Trump.",US Politics
Haley and DeSantis still can’t solve their Trump problem as time runs short in GOP race," A weekend of ferocious political exchanges laid out the tumultuous reality of the 2024 White House campaign less than a year from Election Day. The fight for the GOP nomination is about far more than a horse race between candidates. Its outcome will decide whether the country faces an extraordinary general election – which one potential nominee, ex-President Donald Trump, would fight while facing multiple criminal trials and promising a presidency of retribution that could shake US democracy as never before. Time is quickly ebbing for one of his distant Republican rivals to recast the race less than two months before voting begins. The weekend brought more evidence that other prominent candidates have yet to solve the core question of the GOP primary season: How to exploit Trump’s greatest general election weakness – his lawlessness and criminal exposure – without alienating GOP voters. Just days after Trump was accused of echoing Nazi propaganda and as he firms up plans to use the presidency as a tool of personal vengeance, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley laid out her most strident criticism of Trump yet. But her euphemistic language only highlighted her political dilemma and underscored Trump’s dominance of the primary. Haley said in Iowa that she didn’t agree with Trump’s recent comments referring to political opponents as “vermin,” which had drawn Nazi analogies from the White House and some other critics of the ex-president. She also tried to allude to the potential uproar of a second Trump term without referring to the ex-president’s coming criminal trials or his attempt to subvert the will of voters by staying in power after he lost the 2020 election. “It’s the chaos of it all, right? I think he means well. But the chaos has got to stop,” said Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations. “So it’s not so much about Donald Trump and, yes, his personality is not my personality. And yes, he says things he shouldn’t say. We look so distracted right now. And when America’s distracted, the world is less safe.” Another Trump rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is battling to save his campaign after coming fourth in a new CNN/University of New Hampshire poll of the first GOP primary state, tried a different attack on Trump – though, like Haley, he shied away from the ex-president’s most glaring history. “The presidency’s not a job for an 80-year-old. … Donald Trump would actually be older on January 20, 2025, than Biden was on January 20, 2021,” DeSantis told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the 77-year-old GOP front-runner on “State of the Union” Sunday. “The presidency is not a job for somebody that’s pushing 80 years old. I just think that that’s something that has been shown with Joe Biden. Father Time is undefeated. Donald Trump is not exempt from any of that,” DeSantis added. “I’m in the prime of my life. I go in Day 1. I will serve two terms, deliver big results, and get the country moving again.” Such a prospect seems a long shot, however. After beginning his campaign tipped as the most dangerous Republican challenger to Trump, the Florida governor is now pinning his hopes on a high finish in Iowa to re-create faded momentum countrywide. DeSantis hit on one of the ironies of the 2024 campaign as he tried to paint both potential party nominees with the same brush. Voters consistently tell pollsters that they want a choice other than a 2020 rematch between Biden, who turns 81 on Monday, and Trump. Despite significant reluctance from within their own parties, both men are likely to be the nominees. The Florida governor did, however, make the sale with one Iowa voter who told him on Sunday that he appreciated his point about being able to serve two terms and that he had seen his interview on “State of the Union.” The voter, John Walker, told CNN’s Kit Maher that he still liked the ex-president but added: “I just think there’s a huge amount of uncertainty with Trump, and I don’t like that.” Walker went on: “I don’t like to be uncertain. We don’t know if he’s going to end up in jail.” Still, both Haley and DeSantis know that millions of the ex-president’s supporters have bought into his false claims he won in 2020. And even voters who say at GOP campaign events that they are open to a different candidate often also comment that Trump’s criminal indictments are evidence of political persecution by the Biden administration. There’s very little market for trying to take Trump down. Candidates like former Vice President Mike Pence or former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – who have more openly criticized Trump over his alleged illegalities, including over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents – are either already out of the race or struggling to make a mark nationally. Haley and DeSantis are therefore seeking to preserve their viability by dodging around Trump’s transgressions. But they are failing to hold him to account in a way that might weaken his hold on the nominating race – a scenario that severely restricts their campaigns. Trump this weekend underscored the extreme nature of his candidacy and how he has not moderated in nearly three years out of the White House. During a swing through Iowa, he slammed Haley and DeSantis with petty insults, blasted Biden as “stupid” and “incompetent” and warned he shouldn’t be running the country. The ex-president’s untamed tongue is not just previewing what would likely be a turbulent second term; it is also getting him into trouble in his multiple court cases, resulting judges imposing gag orders. On Monday, Trump’s legal team will argue to a Washington, DC, appeals court that one such order imposed in his federal election subversion criminal case is unconstitutional. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued the measure to stop Trump from targeting court officers, potential witnesses and special counsel Jack Smith and his staff, verbally and on social media. The ex-president claims the measure infringes his First Amendment rights and is an attempt to muzzle his presidential campaign. The gag order, which has been temporarily frozen pending appeals, reflects an enduring reality about the ex-president that is likely to help define the 2024 campaign – his contempt for the rules and customs that govern politics and the legal system. A similar gag order in his New York civil fraud trial was recently lifted temporarily. The judge who issued it, Arthur Engoron, asked Trump’s lawyer at trial two weeks ago whether he could control his client, inadvertently putting his finger on this key point about the ex-president. No lawyer, White House staffer, campaign adviser, political party or institution has ever been able to curb Trump’s impulses. It’s what could make the coming election and his possible second presidency such a perilous proposition. The ex-president is already itching to get on with a potential general election clash. In Iowa, he called on voters to give him such a blowout win in the caucuses in January that it would force rival primary candidates out of the race. “We have to send a great signal and then maybe these people just say, ‘OK, it’s over now. It’s over.’ We got to end it. Because we have to focus on crooked Joe Biden and the Democrats,” Trump said in a speech in which fiercely criticized the president over his China policy after his meeting last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump’s escalating assault comes as Democrats fret about recent polls showing that the former president is leading his successor in most of the key swing states that will decide the election. While Biden’s camp has said things will change when there is a clear contrast between the candidates (assuming Trump becomes the GOP nominee), there are signs that the president’s team is stepping up the pace of his campaign for reelection. “We are turning up the heat and brightening the spotlight on exactly what it would look like if he’s allowed back in the White House,” a Biden campaign official told CNN’s Arlette Saenz of Trump. In one example of his hardening tone, Biden seized on Trump’s dark rhetoric about immigration during a campaign fundraiser in San Francisco last week. “Trump also recently talked about, quote, ‘the blood of America is being poisoned.’ … Again, echoes the same phrases used in Nazi Germany,” Biden said. “Folks, we can’t fail. We can’t fail to treat the threat that he poses.” The ex-president, however, showed how he plans to make the Biden administration’s struggle to control crossings over the southern border the centerpiece of his potential general election campaign. He headed to Texas on Sunday and pocketed the endorsement of the Lone Star State’s governor, Greg Abbott, who warned the situation was creating a “terror threat” in the US. Trump argued that the United States was plagued by “the most unsecure border in the history, I believe, really, of the world.” The vehemence of his remarks this weekend is a reminder that when the campaign heats up after Thanksgiving, Americans are in for one of the most divisive White House races of modern times.",US Politics
Joe Biden is facing a near-historic deficit for an incumbent," Electoral analysts, myself included, like to cover our behinds. We use words like “may” and “could” to make sure we don’t get too far ahead of ourselves – especially when examining polls of a potential 2024 general election matchup between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. But the truth is that Trump has a small but clear advantage over Biden right now. This makes Biden just the second president since scientific polling began to trail in his reelection bid at this point in the campaign. Take a look at recent national surveys from CBS News/YouGov, CNN/SSRS, Fox News, Marquette University Law School and Quinnipiac University. All five are high-quality polls that meet CNN standards for publication. All five give Trump an advantage of 2 to 4 points over Biden among registered or likely voters. On their own, none of these data points mean too much. Trump’s lead in all of them is within the margin of error. Averaged together, though, they paint a picture of an incumbent with a real problem. Over the past 80 years, incumbents have, on average, led their eventual challengers by a little more than 10 points about a year out from the election. This includes nearly every incumbent for whom we have polling since Franklin Roosevelt in 1943. It includes Barack Obama against Mitt Romney in November 2011. This is notable because a number of Democrats have tried to dismiss the current data showing Biden in trouble by saying that Obama had been behind at this point, too. That simply isn’t true. In fact, the lone incumbent to be behind in the polls at this point is the man Biden succeeded and is likely to face again: Trump, who trailed Biden by about 10 points in November 2019. That’s what makes Trump’s small polling edge right now so remarkable. He never had such an edge during the 2020 campaign. I’m not just talking about this point in the 2020 cycle. I’m talking about at any point. I’m also not just talking about a lead in the average. I’m talking about a lead in any national poll that meets CNN’s standards for publication over the entire 2020 cycle. There have been 17 such surveys this cycle in which Trump scored a higher vote share than Biden. The same is true in the swing states, where Trump has been ahead in at least one poll in states where he never led in 2020. These include Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania – all states that will be key in determining the next president. The question, of course, is why is Biden having so much difficulty against a man he was able to defeat the last time. It might be tempting to think that it’s because of a divide within the Democratic ranks. Specifically, that Biden is having issues with his party’s left wing, as reflected by the loud criticism of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. I don’t see that in the numbers. For example, Biden leads Trump 96% to 2% among very liberal voters in the latest Quinnipiac poll. He’s up 95% to 5% among this group in Marquette’s survey. These numbers are, if anything, better than how he performed in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center’s report on validated voters. Biden won very liberal voters 92% to 6%. Biden’s biggest decline is actually in the middle. He was ahead by a mere 12 points among moderates in Quinnipiac’s poll and by 18 points in Marquette’s survey. Fox had him up by 5 points. CNN put the margin at 17 points. The Pew report from 2020 had him winning this bloc by 28 points. The exit polls had him winning moderates by 30 points. On average, we’re talking about a 15-point swing away from Biden. In fact, ideology is probably the wrong way to explain why voters are shifting away from the president. It could be the economy, an issue on which Biden is trailing Trump. But voters also preferred Trump to Biden on the economy by the end of the 2020 campaign. Probably the best explanation for Biden’s troubles that I can come up with is age. More than perhaps any other indicator, the question of whether Biden is too old to be president has changed the most from 2020. Consider the New York Times/Siena College polls released earlier this month from the six closest states Biden won: Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. A massive 71% of registered voters in those states said Biden was too old to be an effective president. A majority of every group listed in the crosstabs of the poll said so, including 51% of Democrats. Back in 2020, half that percentage of registered voters (36%) said Biden was too old to be an effective president. The fact that so many voters feel Biden is too old makes sense given that he is the oldest president ever. Now, Biden could win this campaign if he can convince enough voters that his opponent is too old for the job as well. After all, Trump would also be the oldest president ever to win election. Biden’s problem, though, is that a mere 39% of voters believe Trump is too old for the job. If Biden is able to get that number up, don’t be surprised if the polls begin to shift. But if he can’t, Trump could become the first president since Grover Cleveland to be elected to nonconsecutive terms.",US Politics
Protests encapsulate progressive angst that could imperil Biden’s 2024 campaign," Israel could not have asked for a better friend than President Joe Biden. In the anguished aftermath of the horror unleashed by Hamas on October 7, Biden grieved with Israelis as though he was one of them. As global anger mounted at the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza during Israel’s counter-attack against Hamas, Biden has been unequivocal on the Jewish state’s right to hit back. But rising anger and splits inside the Democratic Party over the ferocity of Israel’s incursion into Gaza and the lack of a ceasefire are creating a volatile political mood inside the United States. Dissent and restiveness among younger voters, and Arab Americans especially, appears to be increasing political risk for Biden on the cusp of the election year. Those divides threaten to exacerbate his weaknesses within his own party, which may pose the biggest risk to his hopes of a second term. Biden’s delicate political position has seen him tread a fine line. He pushed back at suggestions by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would somehow control Gaza after the war. He also said this week that hospitals “must be protected” in the Hamas-ruled enclave. And on Wednesday, he suggested violence in the Middle East would only end with a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Domestically, the president has also unveiled a strategy to tackle Islamophobia, amid concerns among some Democrats he could be vulnerable to losing support of Muslim Americans, especially in the critical swing state of Michigan in next year’s election. Amid an unprecedented upsurge of antisemitic incidents in the United States, especially on college campuses, the president also directed his administration to protect Jewish Americans. But the longer the civilian carnage plays out in Gaza and as anger mounts among activists on the American left, questions will arise over Biden’s capacity to sustain his bedrock support for Israel’s military action. Senior administration officials have repeatedly denied that any part of Biden’s calculations on Israel are rooted in domestic politics. But Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that progressive anger over the war “has a potential” to hurt Biden politically. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN last week that the White House position on the Gaza war was also a problem for Biden among younger voters on whom Democrats often depend to drive up turnout. “I think it’s significant,” the New York Democrat said. “Young people have been paying attention to this issue.” The issue is especially acute given the president’s weak political standing overall, as his reelection race heats up with polls showing that he’s shedding support from critical elements of the Democratic coalition. New polling finds a rising share of the American public disapproving of Israel’s military response to the Hamas terrorist attack – especially Democrats and younger Americans. In the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, for example, 38% of Americans say Israel’s military response to the attack by Hamas has been “too much,” up from 26% in an October survey. More than half of Democrats feel that way and as do about half of voters under age 45. For now, Biden is showing no public sign that he’s feeling political heat. As recently as Wednesday, for instance, he defended Israel’s right to move on al-Shifa hospital in Gaza – an act that attracted broad criticism from around the world, including from progressives and young Democratic voters upset with America’s support for Israel. The Israeli government said the hospital was the site of an underground command center for Hamas and has released a photo and video of an alleged “operational tunnel shaft,” which Hamas has denied as “baseless lies.” CNN cannot verify either side’s claims. “You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military, hidden under a hospital. And that’s a fact; that’s what’s happened,” Biden said in San Francisco. The administration gave more cover to Israel by saying it had its own independent intelligence about how Hamas used the building, though Biden refused to say what it was. Three people familiar with the assessment told CNN Thursday that it was primarily signals intelligence, including intercepted conversations among the militants. Biden’s steadfastness on behalf of Israel is consistent with decades of support as a senator, vice president and now as president, albeit tested by periodic political differences with some Israeli governments, including an estrangement with Netanyahu that endured until a few months ago. While the US had been Israel’s strongest supporter during its latest ordeal, American interests and Biden’s political imperatives are not directly aligned with those of Israel. Last week, for instance, the White House got stark warnings from US diplomats in the Arab world that the US was “losing Arab publics for a generation,” according to a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN. Domestically, meanwhile, the reaction to the war in Gaza has served to reveal already wide ideological splits inside the Democratic Party and the coalition on which Biden is relying to try to carry him to reelection next year. Large numbers of younger voters are showing greater support for the Palestinians than has been typical in the United States, following harrowing video footage of civilian casualties caused by relentless bombing by Israel. Protests have rocked university campuses, where there’s been an outbreak of anti-Israel feeling that has sometimes crossed into blatant antisemitism. On the left, the plight of Palestinians has also become a vessel for frustration among progressive activists and an organizing point for left-wing politics. In the most graphic sign of the dissent Wednesday, a protest demanding a ceasefire in Gaza – for which Biden has refused to call – saw clashes between demonstrators and police outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other senior Democratic leaders were inside at the time. The unrest offered Republicans, who are constantly criticized for insufficiently condemning mob violence in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, a chance to claim that Democrats represented a lawless fringe. Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a vocal supporter of ex-President Donald Trump, wrote on X that “the Democrat Party has fostered an antisemitic, pro-terrorist faction within their own party.” Protests also broke out on Thursday in California on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific summit being hosted by Biden, when a line of cars shut down the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco. While some of the protests have been eye-catching, they pale so far in comparison to the size and intensity of other demonstrations in recent years, including those of the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd, the activism during the Occupy Wall Street movement or street marches against the Iraq War. The scuffles at the DNC on Wednesday evening, while serious, also followed peaceful pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Washington in recent weeks that drew tens of thousands of protesters. Still, the political repercussions of the war in Israel, and the way they are tearing at already evident divides on the left especially, could have an outsize impact in a close election year. The desertion of relatively small numbers of Arab American voters in Michigan, for instance, could be decisive in a close race between Biden and the possible GOP nominee, Trump. And any further dampening of voter enthusiasm among young voters who already have questions about Biden’s advanced age and are now frustrated by his position in the Middle East could hurt the president elsewhere. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny this week uncovered significant skepticism toward Biden among young voters in Georgia, where the president won the cohort by 13 points in 2020 but now essentially splits them with Trump, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll. The White House response to a recent round of coverage of Biden’s political liabilities has been to argue that once there is a direct comparison with Trump, if he becomes the GOP nominee, regular political patterns will reassert themselves. Biden supporters also note the stronger-than-expected showing of Democratic candidates and causes in off-year elections this month, including in state legislative races in Virginia and in a key abortion rights referendum in Ohio. But the danger for Biden may not be that younger voters switch to Trump, but that many simply don’t tune into the election at all. That carries a risk for Democrats down the ballot, too, with the party facing a challenging Senate landscape next year, especially for vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in red states. On one hand, it’s crass to ponder political considerations while so many people are dying, captive and grief-stricken in the Middle East. Palestinians and Israelis alike have a desperate need for the violence to end. But at the same time, the US presidency carries its own huge stakes in an election next year that will reverberate around the world. As a matter of politics, as well as humanity, Biden also needs peace to come as soon as possible.",US Politics
"Takeaways from the Biden-Xi summit, where low expectations were met"," It happened, therefore it was a success. President Joe Biden’s summit with China’s President Xi Jinping south of San Francisco Wednesday may have closed a trap door under the world’s most critical diplomatic relationship, which has plunged to its most acrimonious level in 50 years. But with expectations set so deliberately low and with each side having significant incentives to declare the meeting productive, it was hardly an achievement that the mood music was upbeat after four hours of talks, punctuated by a lunch of herbed ricotta ravioli, tarragon roasted chicken and almond meringue cake. Biden came away hopeful that he had eased the risks posed by US and Chinese forces operating in perilously close quarters in the Asia-Pacific, which he wants to avoid escalating into yet another politically ruinous global crisis during his reelection bid next year. Xi needed to make a statement to his domestic constituency in the communist hierarchy that he has vital US relations under control at a time of economic strife. He also needed to send a signal that China now sees it in its interest to deescalate tensions with other major powers, especially the US, after a fraught chapter. Yet the important but incremental progress made at the Georgian revival-style mansion will do little to mitigate the underlying factors driving the US and China toward a more dangerous rivalry. Styling his approach to Xi as “trust but verify,” Biden explained after the summit that while China and the US were in a competitive relationship, “my responsibility is to make it … rational and manageable, so it so it doesn’t result in conflict – that’s what I’m all about.” Xi, while arguing that the world was big enough for both the US and China to coexist, warned that the United States should not scheme to “suppress or contain” his country, expressing Beijing’s belief that the US desire to compete with its rising rival is really aimed at thwarting China’s rightful destiny. That’s a disconnect that a single summit had no hope of redressing. An agreement to re-establish contacts between the US and Chinese militaries may be the most important thing Biden does this year. “Vital miscalculations on either side can cause real, real trouble with a country like China or any other major country,” Biden told reporters. The potential for US and Chinese naval or air forces to stumble into an incident over or on the South or East China seas is one of the nightmare national security scenarios that keeps officials and foreign policy analysts awake at night. The United States has, therefore, been trying for months to restore communication severed by China after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last year. The Biden administration is worried about scores of what it calls “unprofessional” operations by Chinese planes and ships near US assets. For instance, a Chinese fighter came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber last month. A downing of a US plane or a collision between ships could set off a dangerous escalation that would be difficult to defuse, not least because of fraught political reactions it would unleash in both countries. The emergency landing of a US spy plane on Hainan Island in 2001 after a collision with a Chinese fighter took days of intricate diplomacy to resolve and return the crew. China is now far more aggressive, nationalistic and powerful, and a similar incident would be even more combustible. Even in the darkest days of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained contacts to prevent misunderstandings spiraling into Armageddon. And even amid tensions sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top brass in the Pentagon work to deconflict their operations with Moscow in war zones like Syria. The absence of such dialogue with China has been startling. Full details of the new military-to-military contacts were not yet available on Wednesday. But the success of such efforts will depend on whether agreements made by Xi filter down to lower levels of the People’s Liberation Army forces. And local incidents or wider crises between the US and China could easily reverse Wednesday’s limited progress – as happened after Pelosi’s Taiwan trip or during the flight of a Chinese spy balloon across the United States earlier this year. But a lowering of the threat of misjudgments or misunderstandings alone may justify Biden’s decision to meet Xi. Biden knew his meeting with Xi would unleash a political firestorm. Just talking to China is enough to trigger claims that the president is appeasing an enemy. Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned as the summit ended that Biden had “yet again undermined US national security interests.” The Idaho senator added: “China is not a normal country – it is an aggressor state. Biden is caving to Xi in exchange for a series of meaningless working groups and engagement mechanisms.” Republican presidential candidates have lacerated Biden over his handling of Beijing. They have the luxury of not being responsible for stabilizing the world’s most critical diplomatic relationship and an incentive to misrepresent the intricacies of a complex situation. China bashing has long been a feature of US presidential elections, dating back at least to Democrat Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory over Republican President George H.W. Bush. But the vitriol has been especially stark this year, with GOP candidates like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis implying that louder rhetoric on its own would force China to bow to US power. Biden had huge political incentives to make this summit a success but also needed to show he was tough on Xi. He cannot afford, for instance, a blow-up with China in his reelection year. Already, the US is stretched as wars rage in Ukraine and the Middle East. More turmoil would fuel GOP claims that he’s old and weak and bolster Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s accusations that the world is spiraling out of control under Biden’s watch. It was also significant that the first thing Biden said in his news conference was about a deal with Xi to stem the export from China of precursor chemicals for fentanyl that are creating a deadly narcotics epidemic in the US. It’s one thing for China to agree to curb such activity. It’s another for it to act. But Biden will save many lives if the agreement works. And he now has the talking point for the campaign trial. In his news conference, Biden several times stressed he had been “blunt” with Xi. That’s a function of a tense diplomatic relationship. But it’s also an insurance policy against GOP claims he’s caving to China. While he’s the most powerful Chinese leader in decades and rules a communist autocracy that allows no dissent, Xi also faces political pressures and constraints – to an extent often not appreciated in the US. Xi arrived in San Francisco after a period of unusual turmoil in Chinese politics, firing both his foreign and defense ministers in recent months. China’s economy, meanwhile, is facing multiple crises, including a collapsing housing market and ballooning youth unemployment. “There (was) an incentive for this meeting to go really well. China’s economy is stagnant. … They have a lot of troubles at home,” Sue Mi Terry, a former George W. Bush and Barack Obama National Security Council official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. Xi needs to reverse a drain in foreign investment at a time when many US executives and academics question whether fierce Sino-US tensions will threaten their personal security if they even visit the country. This helps explain a charm offensive in the official Chinese media in the hours leading up to the summit – and Xi’s meetings with US business executives in San Francisco and a dinner with American friends he made on a long-ago trip to Iowa as a junior provincial official. Next year will not simply be a turbulent one in US-China relations because of the American presidential election. The Taiwanese election in January will also pose a severe test. Xi came to the summit seeking public reaffirmation from Biden that the US still backs the “One China” policy, which acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but stops short of recognizing Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. “I’m not going to change that, that’s not going to change,” said Biden, who has nevertheless repeatedly irked Beijing by saying he’d defend Taiwan if China attacked. A senior US official said that Xi impressed upon Biden that China wanted peaceful reunification but laid out conditions that would call for the use of force. The official said Xi remarked: “‘Look, peace is all well and good, but at some point we need to move towards resolution more generally.’” Expectations were low heading into the summit. And they were met. While both sides want to avoid a disastrous confrontation, the trajectory of US-China relations appears destined to bend toward confrontation, which must be constantly managed to prevent an eruption into open conflict. Washington believes that China is the one nation that can usurp the US as the dominant global power. Biden’s formal national security strategy, a document required by Congress, says China is “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it.” But Chinese leaders view US actions to balance Beijing’s bid to become the leading Indo-Pacific and global nation as attempts to thwart its rightful development and destiny. A recent New York Times analysis of Xi’s speeches, for instance, showed that while he has reassured US presidents that he’s keen to find areas of cooperation and defuse geopolitical tensions, he’s spoken at home of an inevitable rivalry with a US adversary he views with fatalistic suspicion. In the simultaneous translation of his remarks Wednesday, Xi appeared to imply the strains in the relationship resulted from US attitudes, saying that while conflict and confrontation would have “unbearable consequences” for both sides, “it’s unrealistic for one side to remodel the other.” A translation of official Chinese script in state media reinforced his point, reading, “It is unrealistic to try to change each other.” One interpretation is that Xi is warning against US attempts to moderate Chinese behavior, either domestically on issues like human rights or business or geopolitically in its region and beyond. Biden is correct. It is vital for the presidents of the world’s two greatest powers to have a way of communicating in the event that conflict beckons. Both Trump and Biden argued that they had unique understandings and connections with Xi. But does the Chinese leader feel the same way? While Washington often argues that despite irreconcilable strategic goals, the US and China can work together — on climate or global security, for instance — Beijing is less publicly effusive about the idea. Right now, opening up slightly to the US appears to be in Xi’s interests. But the forces driving the powers toward further confrontation are broad and volatile. Meeting low bars at a moderately successful summit will not change the fundamentals of their rivalry.",US Politics
"Despite the House passing a stopgap funding bill, representatives acted out a farce"," Sometimes it feels like Congress is trying to parody itself. As lawmakers stagger toward the Thanksgiving recess after some of the ugliest and most unproductive weeks in years, the place is coming completely unglued. Despite the House passing a stopgap funding bill to keep the government open beyond this week, representatives acted out a farce Tuesday. The joke was on Americans deprived of a serious, functioning government. And don’t forget the people of Israel and Ukraine who are waiting in vain for billions of dollars in help from the US as they wage existential fights for their futures. The 118th Congress, which took an initial step to punt funding deadlines to the winter, looked more like a fourth grade class on a day that will further erode trust in government ahead of next year’s elections. That might be fine by some of the hard-right conservatives who abhor Washington and see chaos as a worthy goal in itself. But on the eve of President Joe Biden’s critical summit with President Xi Jinping, the political tomfoolery will only bolster perceptions among US adversaries like China that America’s global power is being undermined by polarization at home. In one extraordinarily frivolous episode on Tuesday, Kevin McCarthy – until recently the most powerful elected Republican in the country – was accused of delivering a painful blow to Rep. Tim Burchett, one of the GOP rebels who ousted him as speaker. “It was a clean shot to the kidneys,” the Tennessean told CNN’s Manu Raju. The former GOP leader repeatedly denied the claim, blaming a tight hallway for the collision. Then, in a flash of bravado, McCarthy added: “If I kidney punched someone, they would be on the ground.” But it wasn’t even the most fiery showdown of the day. Across Capitol Hill in the world’s so-called greatest deliberative body, Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin was spoiling for a prize fight. He told Sean O’Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to “Stand your butt up!” and challenged him to a bout. Mullin was angry at past tweets in which O’Brien apparently called him a “clown.” “You want to do it now?” Mullin asked. “I’d love to do right now,” O’Brien replied from the witness table. A flabbergasted Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders waved his arms, banged his gavel and complained that he was supposed to oversee a hearing not a cage match. “God knows, the American people have enough contempt for Congress, let’s not make it worse,” Sanders warned, reminding Mullin he was a US senator. The normally sleeping confines of the wonkish Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee had never seen anything like it. But Mullin, posing as a Sooner State folk hero, explained to reporters he had no choice but to answer the bell. “You don’t do that in Oklahoma. You don’t run your mouth unless you’re gonna answer the call,” said the former Mixed Martial Arts fighter. Mullin told CNN’s Dana Bash on Wednesday that he had every intention of coming to blows with O’Brien. “I’m not somebody that’s going to say we go around and fight all the time. I got paid to fight. But I will say that every now and then, you do and you should be taught a lesson,” he told CNN. Back in the House, tempers were fraying. Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz got embroiled in a bitter exchange with House Oversight Chairman James Comer over the latter’s probe into the Biden family’s business affairs. After the Florida Democrat accused the Kentucky Republican of hypocrisy, Comer hit back with a bizarre riposte that will baffle future historians leafing through the congressional record. “You look like a Smurf here,” he said. Moskowitz couldn’t let it lie, writing on X that “Gargamel was very angry today.” For the many non-afficionados of the animated series, Gargamel was an evil wizard who hunted Smurfs for fun. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – normally the ringmaster of the Capitol Hill circus – found herself overshadowed. Yet the Georgia Republican did get into it with fellow GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who questioned her maturity over her failed attempt to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Greene responded with a social media post suggesting her California colleague was lacking in a certain area that she implied with various emojis of balls from different sports. The fevered scenes reveal deep dysfunction and dislocation in divided Washington, where anger and personal vitriol has consumed the political system. Donald Trump-style stunt politics has often become dominant in the Capitol. Congress is consumed by fighting within and between the parties. And the febrile mood is only likely to intensify in the coming election year. Normal standards of decorum and respect have been thrown in the trash, and nearly three years after the Capitol insurrection, trust is fractured. Congressional leaders said the near altercations and foul tempers reflected the stress of an extraordinary session that saw the House sit for 10 weeks in a row, ignoring the fact such behavior would be a sackable offense in many workplaces. “Everybody’s tensions are high,” McCarthy said. South Dakota Sen. John Thune – a member of GOP leadership – noted with understatement that we are living in “fairly polarized times.” He added: “There is a lot going on not only here but around the world. Emotions are running high.” Some people might see the gravity of global crises – including heart-breaking footage from the Middle East following the horrendous Hamas terror attacks against civilians and the carnage in Gaza wrought by Israel’s response – as a reason for greater seriousness among the nation’s leaders. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, however, suggested that policing the Capitol was beyond even his wily capacity to enforce discipline within his conference. “It’s very difficult to control the behavior of everybody who’s in the building. I don’t view that as my responsibility. That’s something the Capitol Police will have to deal with,” the Kentucky Republican said. In one minor miracle, the chaotically dysfunctional House of Representatives did manage to take steps Tuesday to avert a threatened government shutdown, passing a plan to temporarily fund the federal machine. The Senate still needs to approve the measure, which would only delay the next funding deadlines until early next year. But even the House’s vote exposed the forces that threaten to tear the chamber apart again soon, with 93 Republicans opposing the bill. Conservatives are smarting at rookie Speaker Mike Johnson’s failure to include massive spending cuts that have no chance of getting past the Democratic-run Senate or Biden’s White House and that would guarantee a shutdown that would damage the GOP and bring pain to millions of Americans. Their recalcitrance meant that Johnson was forced to rely on Democratic votes to get it through the House, using exactly the same maneuver that cost McCarthy his job last month. So effectively, because the GOP majority in the House is so divided, it’s only operable if Democrats want it to be. And only in the malfunctioning Congress would a speaker try to prevent one government shutdown by laying the possible path for two others. That’s because Johnson’s “laddered” approach funds one slice of the government until mid-January and another until early February. In deciding not to topple Johnson for adopting the same strategy as McCarthy, the rebel bloc bolstered an impression that personal rather than ideological animus was behind their political regicide. “I mean, hypocrisy in Washington is nothing new,” Rep. Patrick McHenry, who served as interim speaker, said. Some hardliners, however, suggested Johnson was getting a pass only because he was new in the job. And veteran GOP Rules Chairman Tom Cole indicated that trauma left by the aftermath of one speaker’s demise meant no one was ready for another round. “I think when you touch a hot stove once, you don’t do it twice,” the Oklahoma Republican told CNN. It may just have been a coincidence of course. But Johnson, on a day when he needed to replenish some of the political capital he earned as the most right-wing speaker in history, chose to endorse Trump for president on CNBC. “I’m all in for President Trump. I expect he’ll be our nominee, and he’s going to win it, and we have to make Joe Biden a one-term president.” Thus, a speaker – who, as a backbencher, helped orchestrate some of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election – signed up again with an ex-president whose mob invaded Congress on January 6, 2021, and who falsely claims that his looming four criminal trials are part of a plot to interfere in the 2024 election. The most glaring example of Congress’ failure to fulfill its duty on Tuesday came at a pro-Israel demonstration on the National Mall. Johnson joined Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst on stage in a show of solidarity with the Jewish state. With the Capitol dome — a citadel of democracy for generations — over his shoulder, Johnson stared out over the crowd and the waving blue and white Israeli flags and declared: “There are few issues in Washington that so easily bring together leaders of both parties and both chambers but the survival of the state of Israel and her people unites us together.” Until recently, that was true. There have been few easier bills to pass than those sending aid or weapons to Israel. But in one of his first acts, Johnson complicated Biden’s emergency $14.3 billion request for Israel by loading it up with budget cuts for the Internal Revenue Service that are unacceptable to the Senate and the White House. The message is clear: once sacrosanct measures vital to US national security are now only possible if the extreme right-wing fringe of the GOP majority can get a payoff. Israel is not alone in being neglected. The people of Ukraine, deep into the second year of Russia’s vicious attempted conquest, are still waiting for an even bigger aid package requested by Biden. Large numbers of House Republicans want to cut support for a democratic nation reliant on US and European assistance as their mentor, Trump, vows to end the war within hours if he’s elected president, presumably on the terms of his friend Vladimir Putin. Johnson, who has repeatedly voted against aid for Ukraine, hasn’t ruled out a new package. But he’d almost certainly have to rely on Democrats again, further fraying his authority. On the Senate side, bipartisan negotiations are taking place on a package that would twin Ukraine aid with spending on security on the southern border to give cover to Republicans. No breakthrough is in sight as Republicans accuse Democrats of not showing seriousness in the talks. But while exhausted and aggravated lawmakers head home for their Thanksgiving dinners, time is running out for Ukraine. “Ukraine is going to have trouble getting bullets for their guns in a couple of weeks,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy warned on Monday.",US Politics
"Biden, a pre-boomer, is losing the young voters Democrats need"," It was kind of funny when whoever posts Instagram photos for Joe Biden celebrated the president’s birthday this week with an image of Biden smiling in front of a cake with a bonfire of candles – presumably 81 – on top of it. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the caption reads. That wasn’t Biden’s only stab this week at poking fun at what might be his most glaring weakness, the widely held perception in opinion polls that he’s too old for another term. At the annual White House turkey pardon, Biden made clear he was not there at the first pardon, 76 years ago, even though he was alive at the time. But then he seemed to make a generational gaffe when he conflated Beyonce’s tour with Taylor Swift’s, and then called the latter Britney Spears. Rather than praise the birthday joke on Instagram, most commenters have taken the opportunity to criticize his support for Israel. The content of Instagram comments is not a valid measure of any sentiment, but it is true that when people see that content in their feed, they will also see the criticism. Who knows if the Israel-Hamas war will still be a major top-of-mind issue for American voters when they go to polls in less than a year. Who knows what will happen with the economy, one of the many areas along with his handling of Israel where polls suggest Biden has weak support, even among Democrats. Policy tweaks and the natural course of events could change the framework of those storylines. One thing that won’t change is that Biden will still be the oldest-ever president. While he has poked fun at himself before, the series of jokes on his birthday could be an acknowledgement that his age is an issue to defuse. When Democrats win elections, it is frequently because of turnout by younger voters. In 2022, when Democrats held onto the Senate and only narrowly lost the House, CNN’s Harry Enten wrote they “would have gotten crushed” without younger voters. So it is with alarm that Democrats must be looking at an NBC News poll out this week that confirms a dramatic drop in Biden’s support among young voters. Biden is actually narrowly trailing former President Donald Trump among voters ages 18-34 in that NBC poll. Biden won voters ages 18-29 with 60% of the vote in 2020, according to exit polls. A CNN poll released in early November found a similar drop. It’s important to remember that these current polls are among a pool of all registered voters, which is larger than the subset of people who will actually show up to vote. It is Biden’s strong support for Israel that seems to be contributing to a generational wedge between Democrats. In that NBC poll, only about a third of registered voters approved of his handling of the situation in Israel and only about half of Democrats approved. A majority of Democrats in the poll said Israel had gone too far in its response to the terror attacks by Hamas. CNN’s John King found more anecdotal evidence in a new report from college campuses in Michigan, which has a large Muslim population. He talked to multiple students who said they supported or volunteered for Biden in 2020 but won’t be doing so this year. Rather than support Trump, who has talked about reviving his ban on people from mostly Muslim countries traveling to the US, students told King they may not vote at all or may opt for a more liberal third-party candidate. The writer Franklin Foer wrote a book about Biden, “The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden’s White House and the Struggle for America’s Future.” Appearing on CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Tuesday, he said perceptions of Israel have changed around Biden. “I think part of the generational divide is when Biden was a younger person, Zionism and liberalism were much more deeply interconnected and there was a sense that Israel was an underdog nation,” Foer said. The nation of Israel was founded in 1948. Flip the age issue around and look at Biden’s current difficulty connecting with younger voters not as that of an octogenarian but as someone whose birthday in 1942 predates the post-World War II baby boom, which lasted from 1946 to 1964. There was a string of four boomer presidents, three of whom (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Trump) were all born in 1946, technically the first year of the boom. The fourth, Barack Obama, is technically a boomer as he was born in 1961. There is some gray area between generations, and Obama has written of not really identifying as a baby boomer. And then, the country went back in time from a president born in 1946 to one born in 1942 when it traded in Trump for Biden. Incremental changes to the electorate may have important impacts in the coming years, particularly as baby boomers and voters Biden’s age represent an ever-smaller portion of the people voting. CNN’s Ronald Brownstein has written repeatedly about the changing demographics of the country and how that is affecting its politics. “We are right now at the teetering edge of the influence of the baby boomers,” the University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald told Brownstein back in May for one such story. “They are just starting to enter those twilight years in their turnout rates, while other [more diverse] groups are maturing. So we are right at that cusp – that critical point of where things are going to start changing.”",US Politics
This geographic shift may decide Tuesday’s elections," The biggest question in Tuesday’s elections may be whether Democrats can maintain their advantages in the nation’s biggest population centers – despite all the headwinds buffeting the party. Geographic polarization has been one of the most powerful trends in American politics for roughly the past two decades, with Democrats gaining ground in the most populous metropolitan areas almost everywhere, and Republicans growing stronger in the smaller places beyond them. That trend notably accelerated after Donald Trump emerged as the GOP’s dominant figure in 2016 and has ratcheted up since the Supreme Court rescinded the constitutional right to abortion last year. The GOP’s dominance of exurban, small-town and rural areas helped Trump win the White House in 2016 and has allowed the party to solidify its grip up and down the ballot on interior states with large nonurban populations. But Republicans’ retreat from the well-educated inner suburbs around major cities has been the principal reason for their disappointing results in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections, as well as the anti-abortion movement’s defeat in a series of ballot initiatives since the 2022 Supreme Court decision. By traditional measures, the political environment for Tuesday’s election again looks favorable for Republicans, with most voters expressing dissatisfaction about both the economy and President Joe Biden’s job performance. But all of those conditions were present in the 2022 midterms, when Republicans underperformed anyway, mostly because of continued resistance in the major population centers – especially those well-educated inner suburbs where most voters oppose new restrictions on abortion. The largest urban and suburban areas will likely determine whether Democrats can defy political gravity once again this year in Tuesday’s key elections, from Kentucky and Ohio to Virginia and Pennsylvania. If Democrats run well, it will reinforce the message from the 2022 midterms that they can hold a critical swathe of voters who feel the party has not delivered for their interests by portraying Republicans as a threat to their rights and values. That dynamic may be most clearly on display in the expensive, high-stakes struggle for control of the Virginia legislature. Heading into Tuesday’s vote, Democrats hold a narrow majority in the state Senate and Republicans hold a slim edge in the state House of Delegates. As in many competitive states during the 2022 election, Republicans, by most conventional political measures, are well positioned in Virginia. Even though Biden carried the commonwealth by 10 percentage points in 2020, polling now shows more voters disapprove than approve of his performance; conversely, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has made himself the face of the GOP’s legislative campaign, consistently draws majority approval from state voters. To support the GOP ticket, Youngkin has also raised huge sums of money – much of it from national Republican donors hoping that a strong result Tuesday might entice him into a late entry into the GOP presidential race. And in a recent statewide poll by The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, Virginia voters gave Republicans a double-digit advantage over Democrats when asked which party they trusted to handle both the economy and crime, two issues central to families’ day-to-day concerns. “In normal circumstances, with an incumbent Democrat [president] under water, as Biden is, and the economy playing so strongly in favor of Republicans, you would expect a Democratic wipe-out,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School. “But that’s just not happening.” Instead, the Post/Schar survey showed Democrats slightly leading when voters were asked which party they intended to support in the Virginia legislative contests. Translating that broad sentiment into individual state House and Senate race results is an imperfect process. And because the margins in each chamber are so narrow, most analysts agree that both chambers are still within reach of either party. But generally, observers following the contests say they will be surprised if Republicans win control of both chambers – and maybe less startled if Democrats flip the state House while holding the Senate to achieve control of their own. “It doesn’t really feel like 2021,” when Youngkin stunned Democrats by surging in the final weeks to capture the governorship, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the political newsletter published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “At the very least a Republican sweep would be a surprise. And a Democratic sweep would be less surprising.” Both parties agree the Democratic emphasis on protecting legal abortion is the principal reason the party remains in such a competitive position, despite all the other GOP advantages. In the Post/Schar poll, Democrats led Republicans by nearly 20 points when Virginia voters were asked which party they trusted to handle abortion; the share of female voters who said abortion was an important issue in their choice stood at 70%, way up from just under half in polling around the 2019 legislative elections. Warnings that Republicans will restrict abortion rights dominate Democratic advertising in most of the key races.  “If we win, we win because of it,” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster working on the Virginia races, said of abortion. “And if we turn out our base, we turn out our base because of it.” The Democratic emphasis on preserving abortion rights isn’t unusual: The party did the same in virtually every competitive race in 2022. More unusual is how much Virginia Republicans have emphasized the issue too. Youngkin has made clear that if provided control of the legislature, Republicans will ban abortion at 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. The governor’s political advisers argue that voters will see such restrictions as a “consensus” solution to a polarizing issue, and the latest Post/Schar poll, like earlier surveys, found the state split about evenly over a 15-week ban. “I really feel that this is a moment for us to come together around reasonable limits,” Youngkin argued on ABC News this past weekend. “I think that this is a reasonable place for us to land.” But Democrats believe the more telling measure is that only about one-fourth of Virginia voters say in polls they want the state’s abortion laws made more restrictive than the current standard, which permits the procedure through 26 weeks of pregnancy. By emphasizing their plan to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks, Rozell and others believe, Republicans have raised the salience of the issue that most favors Democrats. Heather Williams, the interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, briskly encapsulated the Democrats’ closing message when she said: “When voters go to the polls on Tuesday, they know that if they wake up on Wednesday and there is Republican control in the state, there will be an abortion ban. Period.” Control of both chambers will be decided primarily in relatively well-educated suburban House and Senate districts across the state, particularly in Northern and Central Virginia, around Washington, DC, and Richmond. The Post/Schar poll gave Democrats a roughly 25-point advantage in the former and a 10-point lead in the latter. If the state’s major suburban areas break for Democrats because of abortion, “that is basically the ballgame,” said Kondik. If populous (and mostly prosperous) suburbs prove the bridge too far for Virginia Republicans, it would extend a striking pattern from other recent contests in which abortion has played a central role. In the seven states that have held ballot initiatives related to the issue since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision, the side favoring abortion rights has consistently dominated the largest places. In these ballot initiatives, abortion rights supporters carried all six of the counties that cast the most votes in Kansas, eight of the 10 counties that cast the most votes in Kentucky and Michigan, and the 14 largest in California. Even in Montana, which doesn’t have many population centers, an anti-abortion ballot measure lost in all three of the counties that cast the most votes. (A Vermont constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in 2022 carried every town in the state.) In this summer’s first round of Ohio’s battle over abortion – a GOP-backed measure to make it more difficult to change the state’s Constitution – the abortion rights side carried 14 of the state’s 17 largest counties, including several that had voted for Trump in 2020, according to the results posted by The New York Times. Round two of Ohio’s confrontation over abortion will come Tuesday when voters will decide a ballot measure that would repeal a six-week ban on the procedure that the GOP legislature passed, and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed, in 2019. Some voters have been confused because both this summer’s proposed change to the state constitution and the current measure to repeal the abortion ban have been designated as Issue One, and the position in support of abortion rights was a “no” vote over the summer and is a “yes” vote now. But the limited polling available has found the measure likely to pass, largely because of preponderant support among urban and suburban voters. Democrats are counting on similar metro support in two other races Tuesday in which abortion has loomed large: a state Supreme Court contest in Pennsylvania and Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s reelection bid against Republican state Attorney General Daniel Cameron. When Beshear narrowly won a first term in the Republican-leaning state four years ago, he combined a strong performance in the state’s major population centers of Louisville and Lexington with an unusually competitive showing in smaller, blue-collar Eastern Kentucky counties. But Beshear will likely struggle to match his small town performance this year with hostility to Biden running high in those places.  Beshear this time is stressing his support for abortion rights, and if he wins, he will likely have relied even more on Kentucky’s largest counties, including several that are functionally suburbs of Cincinnati, just across the Ohio border. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court election between Republican Carolyn Carluccio and Democrat Daniel McCaffery will likely follow a similar path. As Kondik and a colleague noted in a recent analysis, the most recent state Supreme Court election (in 2021) did not track Pennsylvania’s usual presidential patterns, which have seen Democrats gaining in major white-collar suburban areas around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Republicans advancing in the mostly blue-collar, smaller places between them. But with abortion and voting rights dominating the current race, Kondik said it is much more likely to follow the presidential map, which should provide Democrats the edge. In all these ways, Tuesday’s elections may underscore the intractability of the geographic polarization that has reshaped American politics through the 21st century. In 2020, Biden won fully 91 of the nation’s 100 largest counties, while Trump carried over 2,500 of the remaining 3,000. Biden dominated all the hubs of the emerging information economy: According to tabulations by Brookings Metro, a nonpartisan think tank, Biden-won counties generated 71% of the nation’s total economic output, even though he captured  only one-sixth of counties overall. Trump romped in the nonmetro places that are home to much of the nation’s manufacturing, energy extraction and agriculture. The 2022 election showed how difficult it was to dislodge these patterns. Despite the widespread discontent over Biden and the economy, Democrats in the key races maintained (or even enlarged) advantages in populous suburban counties outside Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin. Republicans continued to post strong numbers beyond those metro areas – and in some cases, Democrats suffered diminished margins in heavily minority inner-city neighborhoods where discontent over the economy is widespread. But the Democratic suburban gains allowed them to win seven of the nine governor’s and Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – the five states that decided the 2020 presidential race by switching from Trump in 2016 to Biden. Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project at Michigan State University, said voters’ geographic separation into blue metros and red non-metros has enormous, possibly irreversible, momentum. That separation now reflects not only political choices, he noted, but also decisions by marketers, who reinforce the diverging demographic patterns by locating retail outlets and restaurants that appeal to the predominant groups in each region. Everyone now understands the underlying cultural differences between a community with a Whole Foods or a Panera Bread, and one with a Cracker Barrel. “A community develops in a certain way and attracts a certain kind of person with certain beliefs and the consumer marketing industry reads that pretty quickly and knows the things to put in those locations to appeal to those people,” Chinni said. “It seems to me everything that’s built into the system is designed to reinforce these differences.” Both parties are uneasy about where this geographic resorting has left them. Many Democrats worry that their rural decline dangerously constricts the number of House and Senate seats they can realistically win. Many Republicans in turn worry that it’s a losing hand to trade gains in rural places that are stagnant or declining in population for losses in suburban areas that are growing. “It’s a trajectory that is not sustainable for Republicans,” said veteran Wisconsin GOP strategist Mark Graul. Referring to the major suburban county outside Milwaukee and a rural Western Wisconsin county, he added, “We can’t subtract three voters in Waukesha County for a voter in Trempealeau County. The math doesn’t work.” The persistent public dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance on the economy, crime and other issues provides Republicans a powerful wedge to move voters in the major population centers away from Democrats. Tuesday’s major elections will test whether that discontent is sufficient to overcome the durable doubts in these places about the Trump-era GOP on issues relating to rights, personal freedoms and democracy. The results will offer the year’s last major ballot-box test of how voters are balancing those contrasting beliefs almost exactly one year before they pick the next president.",US Politics
Fact checking the 3rd GOP debate of the 2024 election," Five of the Republican presidential candidates made a variety of false, misleading or lacking-in-context claims on Wednesday during the third debate of the 2024 party primary. The frontrunner in the race, former President Donald Trump, again skipped the debate in favor of his own speech. Here is a fact check of some of the claims from candidates who were on the debate stage in Miami. During a back-and-forth about how the candidates would address incidents of antisemitism on college campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Gov. Ron DeSantis said President Joe Biden is combating Islamophobia instead of supporting Jewish students. “Not only is he not helping the Jewish students, who are being persecuted, he is launching an initiative to combat so-called Islamophobia. No, it’s antisemitism that’s spiraling out of control,” DeSantis said. Facts First: This is misleading. While the Biden administration announced last week that it is developing a national strategy to counter Islamophobia, the White House already released a national strategy to combat antisemitism in May. Earlier this week, the Department of Education issued guidance reminding schools that they have a legal obligation to address incidents of both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The guidance specifically said that schools must address discrimination based on race, color, or national origin – including against those who are Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab or Palestinian. “When it comes to antisemitism or Islamophobia, that has no place on our college campuses or in our schools,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told CNN. Biden has repeatedly denounced antisemitism, both after the Hamas attack and for years before. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco Asked about supporting the use of military force against Iran in response to the recent attacks on US troops in Iraq and Syria by Iranian proxy groups, former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said, “The idea that our men and women could be targeted, and that we’ve allowed almost 100 hits to happen under Biden’s watch is unthinkable.” Facts first: Haley’s figure is incorrect. As of Wednesday, Iranian-backed groups had targeted US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria at least 41 times since October 17 with one-way attack drones or rocket attacks. The most recent was a multi-rocket attack on Wednesday, on forces at Shaddadi, Syria. Haley also said that the US needed to “go and take out their infrastructure that they are using to make those strikes with so they can never do it again.” A senior military official told reporters on Wednesday that an airstrike that day by US F-15 fighter jets hit a weapons storage facility used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Corps Guard that is believed to house “weapons that we believe are likely used in many of the strikes that have taken place against our forces here in the region.” From CNN’s Haley Britzky Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said, “Frankly, President Biden has sent billions to Iran.” Facts First: This needs context. Scott didn’t explain that the $6 billion in question was not “sent” from the US itself and is not money from US taxpayers. It is $6 billion of Iran’s own money, from oil sales, that had been frozen in restricted South Korean accounts until the Biden administration agreed in September to allow it to be transferred to restricted accounts in Qatar – to be used with US approval by Iran for certain specified humanitarian purposes – as part of a deal in which Iran agreed to free five Americans the US had deemed wrongfully detained. The Biden administration has repeatedly said that none of the $6 billion has been spent yet. And in early October, after the Hamas attack on Israel, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House Democrats that the US and Qatar had reached a “quiet understanding” to not allow Iran to access any of the money for the time being, a source in the room told CNN in October. (While Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not confirm that a “quiet understanding” had been reached, he made clear the US is able to freeze the funds.) Even before that, the Biden administration emphasized that the Iranian government would not be able to pocket the money itself and that it could only be used, under strict US supervision, to make humanitarian purchases from approved vendors. Some critics of the Biden administration and the deal with Iran have fairly pointed out, however, that Iran getting access to $6 billion for humanitarian purposes could free up that same amount of its own money to be used to fund terror. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy claimed during the debate that “Joe Biden’s son Hunter got a $5 billion bribe from Ukraine.” He claimed that this bribe was the reason the US has sent so much aid to Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia last year. Facts First: The claim that any member of the Biden family received a bribe is unproven. An FBI informant who relayed the claim to the FBI in 2020 was merely reporting something he said he had been told by a Ukrainian businessman, the chief executive of the energy company where Hunter Biden had served on the board of directors; the informant provided no proof to the FBI, and no proof has publicly emerged in the subsequent years. In addition, there is no evidence that US wartime aid to Ukraine – which has been approved by bipartisan majorities in Congress – has anything to do with the president’s son. According to an internal FBI document made public by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa earlier this year over the strong objections of the FBI, the informant told the bureau in 2020 – when Donald Trump was president – that the CEO of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, had claimed in 2016 that he made a $5 million payment to “one Biden” and another $5 million payment to “another Biden.” But the FBI document did not contain any proof for the claim, and the document said the informant was “not able to provide any further opinion as to the veracity” of the claim. Republicans have tried to boost the credibility of the allegation by saying it was in an FBI document and that the FBI had viewed the informant as highly credible. But the document merely memorialized the information provided by the informant; it does not demonstrate that the information is true. And Hunter Biden’s former business associate Devon Archer testified to the House Oversight Committee earlier this year that he had not been aware of any such payments to the Bidens; Archer characterized Zlochevsky’s reported claim as an example of the Ukrainian businessman embellishing his influence. From CNN’s Daniel Dale, Marshall Cohen and Annie Grayer In his opening remarks, Ramaswamy accused the media of interfering in the outcome of previous US elections. “This media rigged the 2016 election, they rigged the 2020 election with the Hunter Biden laptop story and they’re going to rig this election unless we have accountability,” Ramaswamy said. Facts First: This claim is false. Neither election was “rigged” and there is no evidence of any fraud large enough to have changed the outcome. Officials from the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security, along with state election officials, said in a 2020 statement: “The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.” And tellingly, in Ramaswamy’s own 2022 book “Nation of Victims,” he writes that the “2016 election wasn’t stolen in a literal sense” and that he hadn’t seen “convincing evidence” that the 2020 election was stolen or rigged. “The fact that all of our governmental institutions so unanimously found no evidence of significant fraud is telling. Furthermore, I’ve talked to many Republicans at all levels of government, and not one has ever presented convincing evidence that the 2020 election was stolen from President Trump; very few have seriously tried. I don’t believe that most Republican politicians actually think the election was stolen,” Ramaswamy wrote. Asked about this change in his stance by NBC’s Chuck Todd in August, Ramaswamy claimed that in his books he also discussed what he did see as consequential election interference in 2020 – how “big tech” had worked to prevent the spread of a late-campaign story related to Hunter Biden’s laptop. However, Ramaswamy’s claim during the debate was directed not at tech companies but the media, who were actually the first to break the story around the laptop. Ramaswamy has previously argued that the media spread an unfair narrative of Russian collusion in the 2016 election that robbed Trump of the ability to do the job after he was elected. However, a bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee backed the US intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help then-candidate Donald Trump. From CNN’s Tara Sumbramaniam Haley once again attacked DeSantis for his record on fracking after their heated exchange on the topic during the second GOP debate. “On the energy side, it cracks me up that Ron continues to do this,” Haley said Wednesday. “He has opposed fracking, he’s opposed drilling,” Haley claimed.“He opposed it before Florida voters even voted on it.” Facts First: DeSantis has pushed back on these accusations repeatedly, but Haley is largely right. While DeSantis did not unilaterally ban fracking before Florida voters passed a state constitutional amendment to do so, he signed an executive order signed just days after he took office which called for the state to “adamantly oppose all off-shore oil and gas activities off every coast in Florida and hydraulic fracturing in Florida.” And aside from the semantics, Haley’s broader argument about DeSantis’ position regarding off-shore drilling and fracking is supported by his comments and actions. During DeSantis’ 2018 gubernatorial campaign, he was asked if he supported a ban on fracking and he emphatically said yes. In January 2020, he also oversaw the purchase of 20,000 acres of Everglades wetlands by the state of Florida to permanently protect them from oil drilling, which wasn’t prompted by the constitutional amendment in any way. From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam As Tuesday’s election results highlighted, abortion remains one of the key flashpoint topics among voters. In Wednesday’s debate, Scott claimed that 75% of Americans support a federal ban on abortion for women who are at least 15 weeks pregnant. “We need a 15-week federal limit. Three out of four Americans agree with a 15-week limit,” Scott said. Facts First: This needs context. A spokesperson for Scott’s campaign told CNN during the debate that Scott was citing polling conducted for the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which a review found used loaded language and did not offer respondents a complete range of possible responses. Some independent polls conducted this year and last, which have posed abortion questions far more neutrally, have found significantly less than 75% support for an abortion ban at or after 15 weeks. The poll from SBA found 77% support for at least some limits by 15 weeks. But there are significant issues with that poll. The relevant question prompted respondents with language about “a baby’s heartbeat” and how “a baby can feel pain,” using much more emotional language than independent polls tend to use. The poll also did not provide an option for respondents to express support for abortion limits any later in a pregnancy than 15 weeks. Instead, it only allowed respondents to endorse one of the following: an abortion ban throughout pregnancy with exceptions for the life of the mother, rape and incest; a 6-week ban with those exceptions; a 15-week ban with those exceptions; completely unrestricted abortion throughout pregnancy, or “I am completely unsure.” In other words, the poll didn’t even mention the possibility of an abortion ban at fetal viability, meaning when the fetus might be able to survive outside the womb with or without medical help, often viewed as around 23 or 24 weeks. More neutral polls conducted by media and academic entities have produced much different findings. For example, an AP-NORC poll in June asked US adults if they think their state should or shouldn’t allow a pregnant person to get a legal abortion at various points in a pregnancy; 51% said their state should allow legal abortion at the 15-week mark, 45% said their state should not. A Marquette Law School poll in July asked US adults if they would support or oppose a national law banning abortion after 15 weeks; 47% were in favor, 53% were opposed. A Fox News poll in April asked registered voters if they would favor or oppose a law in their state banning abortion after 15 weeks “except in the case of a medical emergency.” Fifty-four percent said they would favor such a law, 42% said they would oppose it. That is more support than the above polls that did not mention a medical-emergency exemption, but still well below the 75% Scott mentioned. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tara Subramaniam In advocating for a 15-week federal limit on abortion, Scott said that he “would not allow states like California, Illinois or New York to have abortion up until the day of birth.” Facts First: This needs context. California, Illinois, and New York do not allow unrestricted abortion throughout a pregnancy. Each of these states prohibits abortion after a certain point, though they each allow some exceptions afterward to protect the health of the person who is pregnant. It’s possible that Scott was suggesting that, without a federal law to impose a nationwide limit on abortion, these Democratic-led states would remove all limits on abortion in the future. But his wording left open the impression that he was saying that these states have no limits today, and that’s not the case. California and Illinois both allow abortion until fetal “viability,” meaning when the fetus might be able to survive outside the womb with or without medical help – often viewed as around 23 or 24 weeks – and after that when abortion is needed to protect the “life or health” of the patient; their laws echo the language of the Supreme Court’s now-overturned Roe v. Wade decision, which required “life or health” exceptions after viability. New York specifies that abortion is illegal after 24 weeks except when the fetus is not viable or when abortion is necessary to protect the pregnant person’s “life or health”; under a 2019 New York state law, abortion is never treated as a crime. Some conservatives object to the presence of “life or health” exceptions in abortion laws, arguing that the “health” part of these exceptions is so broad that it essentially permits abortion at any time. But the claim about “abortion on demand” wrongly suggests that anyone can demand an abortion in these states at any time for any reason at all. It’s also worth noting that a tiny percentage of abortions are performed at 24 weeks or later. According to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks or later. (Some of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies.) By contrast, 80.9% of reported abortions in 2020 were conducted before 10 weeks, 93.1% before 14 weeks and 95.8% before 16 weeks. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Speaking about Biden’s response to Hamas’ attack on Israel, DeSantis, who is the governor of Florida, said, “We had Floridians that were over there after the attack. He [Biden] left them stranded. They couldn’t get flights out. So, I scrambled resources in Florida. I sent planes over to Israel and I brought back over 700 people to safety. There could have been more hostages had we not acted.” Facts First: DeSantis’ statement, which appears to say Biden failed to evacuate Americans out of Israel, is both untrue and needs context. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced on October 12 that the US government would begin arranging charter flights for Americans seeking to leave Israel on October 13. The first US government flight out of Israel landed in Athens on October 13. On October 30, State Department spokesman Matt Miller said the agency was suspending charter flights due to a lack of demand. Separately, DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Florida on October 12, allowing him to access a $500 million fund that does not require legislative approval, to evacuate people from Israel to Tampa. He told reporters in New Hampshire in October that he anticipated the first evacuation flight would land in Florida on October 15. DeSantis’ claim that “there could have been more hostages” without his evacuation flights is a hypothetical; we can’t definitively fact check whether more hostages might be taken in the future. But it’s worth noting that no hostages have been taken from Israel since Hamas’ October 7 attack.DeSantis declared a state of emergency five days later to begin chartering flights, after Israeli forces had taken back control of the country. Asked for an explanation of the claim, DeSantis campaign spokesperson Bryan Griffin said in an email during the debate: “Of course Hamas could’ve taken more hostages. Everyone Ron DeSantis brought home is 100% safe from that possibility.” From CNN’s Haley Britzky Ramaswamy claimed that Ohio “passed a constitutional amendment that now effectively codifies a right to abortion all the way up to the time of birth without parental consent” because of a “Republican culture of losing.” Facts First: This is false. The passage of ballot measure Issue 1 on Tuesday establishes a person’s right to an abortion in the Ohio state constitution. The measure does not explicitly say that abortion is allowed under any circumstance, nor does it change Ohio’s parental consent and notification law. Rather, the new amendment to the state constitution says that any kind of ban on the procedure pre-viability (typically at 23 to 24 weeks) is prohibited under state law. By the time a person is pregnant for 24-weeks there is a good chance the child could survive outside the womb. After viability, the state can restrict a person’s access to an abortion unless the pregnant person’s health or life is at risk because of that pregnancy.An abortion late in pregnancy is exceptionally rare. In Ohio, a minor will still need a parent’s permission to get an abortion, or they must get an exception from a judge. From CNN’s Jen Christensen DeSantis said during the debate, “In Florida, I banned China from buying land in the state.” Facts First: This needs context. The law signed by DeSantis prohibits most land purchases in Florida by Chinese entities and individuals (who are not US citizens or permanent residents), but the law did not completely ban all land purchases by these entities and individuals – as DeSantis’ categorical claim here may have suggested to debate viewers. DeSantis signed a bill this year that prohibits the ownership of real property in Florida by the Chinese government, its ruling Communist Party, members or officials of either the government or the party, other organizations based in China, or “any person who is domiciled in the People’s Republic of China and who is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.” But the law contains an exemption for Chinese individuals who have been granted asylum in the US or are on a US visa that is not a tourist visa. Those individuals are allowed to make one purchase of a residential property, of up to two acres, if the property is more than five miles from a military installation. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Asked how she would help rural Americans who are being squeezed by inflation, former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said she would look to recover unspent Covid-19 relief funds. “I will make sure, one, we claw back the $500 billion of unspent Covid dollars that are out there,” she said. Facts First: Haley’s number is inaccurate. Haley made the same claim in a CNN town hall in June, and her data was out of date at the time. CNN checked again in late August and found that about $300 billion in Covid-19 relief funds has not been spent or committed, according to an estimate from the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a government watchdog group. That figure takes into account the roughly $28 billion in Covid-19 funds that were rescinded as part of the debt ceiling package in June. There is even less money that is unobligated, or not yet legally committed, that Congress could claw back. Only $104.3 billion remains in unobligated and unexpired funds, as of April 30, according to the US Government Accountability Office. However, this figure does not include the recissions enacted in the debt ceiling package. From CNN’s Tami Luhby In a series of comments about Ukraine, Ramaswamy argued that the country is “not democratic.” To support that claim, he said that Ukraine “has threatened not to hold elections this year, unless the US forks over more money.” Facts First: This needs context. In an August interview, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did note that additional funding was one of several things the country needed in order to hold elections, but he requested help from both the US and Europe. “If the United States and Europe give us financial support… I’m sorry, I will not hold elections on credit, I will not take money from weapons and give it to elections either,” Zelensky said, according to excerpts of the interview shared on his official website. And Zelensky was clear in the August interview that a lack of funds was not the only obstacle. He said elections in Ukraine would be possible only if the right to vote is ensured for all citizens, including military personnel and forced migrants abroad and if foreign observers can be present at polling stations on the frontline. Just days before Ramaswamy’s comments during the debate, Zelensky said it would be “irresponsible” to hold an election now but did not cite a lack of funds or call on the US for additional aid for future elections. “In wartime, when there are so many challenges, it is absolutely irresponsible to throw the topic of elections into society in a lighthearted and playful way,” Zelensky said in his nightly address Monday. “I believe that now is not the right time for elections.” Presidential elections in Ukraine typically take place every five years but have been suspended under martial law since the conflict began. This week, Ukraine’s parliament approved the extension of martial law and mobilization in the country by 90 more days. Zelensky was sworn into office in May 2019, meaning he would be up for re-election in the spring of 2024. From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam Former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, attacking rival candidate Gov.Ron DeSantis, said: “We will go and end all formal trade relations with China until they stop murdering Americans from fentanyl, something Ron has yet to say that he’s going to do.” Haley, attacking rival candidate DeSantis, said: “We will go and end all formal trade relations with China until they stop murdering Americans from fentanyl, something Ron has yet to say that he’s going to do.” Facts First: This is misleading. DeSantis, like Haley, has campaigned in support of ending China’s preferential trade status, known as permanent normal trade relations. Haley has been more explicit in linking the proposed trade status revocation to China’s role in the US fentanyl crisis, saying that “as president, I will push Congress to revoke permanent normal trade relations until the flow of fentanyl ends.” But DeSantis has also called for eliminating the trade status, has called for “economic independence from China” and has decried China’s role in the fentanyl crisis – so Haley’s debate remark suggested more of a difference between their positions than there actually is. From CNN’s Daniel Dale",US Politics
Fact check: Donalds makes inaccurate claim about Biden’s income to argue he couldn’t legitimately afford loan to his brother," The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer, raised questions in October about a $200,000 check that one of Joe Biden’s siblings wrote to Biden in March 2018 with the words “loan repayment” written on the front. Though the available evidence suggests that James Biden was indeed repaying a $200,000 loan that Joe Biden had sent him less than two months prior, Comer has repeatedly said he doesn’t “believe” Joe Biden had made the loan at all. This Tuesday and Wednesday, another Republican congressman, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, scoffed at the idea that Biden could have legitimately afforded such a loan. “When does a member – somebody who’s been in the US Senate making $174,000 a year – have $200,000 to lend his brother? I mean, give me a break. This is just absolutely ridiculous,” Donalds said in a Tuesday night interview on right-wing television channel Newsmax, calling Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California “dumb” for believing there was a legitimate loan. On Wednesday, Donalds posted a clip of the interview on his account on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and wrote: “Imagine being dumb enough to believe that a career politician who makes less than $200,000 a year can somehow ‘loan’ his family $200,000.” Facts First: The premise of Donalds’ claims is wrong. Biden was earning far more than $200,000 per year in January 2018, when his brother was sent the $200,000 payment; he was not in government at the time. Biden and his wife Jill Biden reported about $11 million in adjusted gross income on their 2017 tax returns and about $4.6 million on their 2018 tax returns. Most of the income was from a multi-million-dollar book deal and the dozens of paid speeches for which Joe Biden received five-figure and six-figure fees. So: Donalds argued it is “ridiculous” to think that someone would be able to afford a $200,000 loan on a senator’s salary, but whether that’s true in general is irrelevant when it comes to the president in particular. Biden, whose vice presidency ended in January 2017, was earning many multiples of a senator’s salary at the time his brother was wired the $200,000. (Comer says there is reason to doubt Democrats’ claims that Joe Biden was the person behind the wired money; as CNN explained earlier this week, the available evidence suggests, though does not prove with absolute certainty, that it was indeed Joe Biden.) Biden released his 2017 and 2018 tax returns in 2019, when he launched his 2020 presidential election campaign. Therefore, the fact that he had a lucrative 2017-2018 period while out of government has been publicly known for years now – as Semafor journalist Dave Weigel noted when he challenged Donalds’ claim on social media on Wednesday. And a minor additional note: Biden served as vice president for eight years after his 36 years in the US Senate, so he was earning the vice president’s salary of $230,700 at the time the Obama-Biden administration ended, not a senator’s salary of $174,000. Asked for comment on Wednesday, Donalds spokesperson Harrison Fields did not dispute the fact that Biden was making millions per year, not the $174,000 per year Donalds claimed on Newsmax, at the time of the $200,000 payment to Biden’s brother in 2018. But Fields argued that focusing on this fact would “miss the forest for the trees” and “really miss the point.” He said Donalds was making a bigger point, which Fields said Donalds’ followers on X would understand, about what Fields contended is a record of “sketchy at best” financial dealings by Biden and his family.",US Politics
Mike Johnson’s America: Revisit landmark SCOTUS decisions and use government to ‘restrain evil’," Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, voiced support for revisiting Supreme Court decisions that struck down restrictions on the use of contraception, barred bans on gay sex and legalized same sex marriages, according to a CNN review of his prior public statements. On a conservative talk radio show the day the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Johnson underscored Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion that the high court should reconsider those other landmark rulings. Johnson, citing his years as an attorney against “activist courts,” defended Thomas’ view, insisting that what Thomas was calling for was, “not radical. In fact, it’s the opposite of that.” “There’s been some really bad law made,” he said. “They’ve made a mess of our jurisprudence in this country for the last several decades. And maybe some of that needs to be cleaned up.” When asked about Johnson’s post-Roe comments, a spokesman for the congressman told CNN that Johnson “views the cases as settled law.” Still, CNN’s review of more than 100 of Johnson’s interviews, speeches and public commentary spanning his decades-long career as a lawmaker and attorney paints a picture of his governing ideals: Imprisoning doctors who perform abortions after six weeks; the Ten Commandments prominently displayed in public buildings; an elimination of anti-hate-crime laws; Bible study in public schools. From endorsing hard labor prison sentences for abortion providers to supporting the criminalization of gay sex, his staunchly conservative rhetoric is rooted in an era of “biblical morality,” that he says was washed away with the counterculture in the 1960s. “One of the primary purposes of the law in civil government is to restrain evil,” Johnson said on one radio show in 2010. “We have to acknowledge collectively that man is inherently evil and needs to be restrained.” His vision has been well received as a congressman in his deeply conservative district in western Louisiana. But his surprising rise to the speakership has brought his particularly subtle brand of fire-and-brimstone to second in line to the presidency — delivering him a national platform from which to shape and influence laws. Johnson’s endorsement of Thomas’ opinion, legal experts say, positioned him significantly outside the mainstream. “Speaker Johnson embraces a view that is not only outside of the mainstream but is so radical in terms of his endorsement of the Thomas position, that even the extremely conservative Supreme Court majority isn’t willing to go there,” said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a CNN legal analyst. “It would take the country back more than a half-century.” CNN unearthed more than two dozen radio interviews from Johnson’s time as an attorney at the socially conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) where Johnson litigated and voiced support for what he sometimes described as a battle for the country between the forces of good and evil. “The arrows in the culture war are particularly directed at our youth, where the Enemy often has the greatest effect,” read the 2005  webpage for “God & Country,” a Christian local radio show co-hosted by Johnson. “We cannot lose our children to the forces of darkness. Be aware and get active in your kids’ schools.” Topics discussed on the show included “creation science” in public schools; how to “fight the porn industry”; God’s “design for government”; and “the true meaning of ‘separation of church and state.’” As an attorney at ADF, Johnson repeatedly battled two organizations in his fight to keep religion in the public square: The American Civil Liberties Union, which he called “the most dangerous organization in America,” and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The groups clashed over prayer in public schools, public displays of nativity scenes and the right to open public meetings with prayer. “They have convinced an entire generation of Americans that there’s this so-called separation of church and state,” Johnson said in 2008 about the ACLU. Johnson’s rhetoric has tapped into a “persecution complex” for evangelicals as American culture leans increasingly left on social issues, said Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor. “They want to feel embattled. They want to fight the culture war,” Burge told CNN. “When he talks about Griswold and Lawrence, evangelicals know that what he really is saying to them is: ‘Our way of life is under attack and liberalism is on the march. Stand firm in our convictions,’” added Burge, referring to the landmark cases that legalized gay sex and contraception use. Johnson served not only as an attorney at ADF but a national spokesman for the organization, making appearances on radio and national television where he often addressed so-called “right of conscience” cases involving Christian businesses. Discussing one case in New Mexico, where a wedding photography company was found in violation of the state’s anti-discrimination laws for refusing to photograph a same-sex couple’s commitment ceremony, Johnson argued anti-discrimination laws did not recognize a “behavior” like homosexuality. “There are laws on the books that prohibit discrimination against people for their immutable characteristics, their race and creed and that kind of thing,” Johnson said in a 2009 radio interview. “There’s a difference – and the law has recognized a difference – between that and homosexual behavior. As something that you do, not an immutable characteristic of what you are.” The New Mexico Supreme Court disagreed and ruled against the company, which ADF represented. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Johnson “doesn’t understand the problem with a government compelling its citizens to follow not just religion, but a particular religion,” said Katherine Lewis Parker, the former legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina, who opposed Johnson in a lawsuit related to prayer at official meetings. In that 2007 suit, three residents in Forsyth County, North Carolina, argued local officials had an unconstitutional “practice of sponsoring sectarian prayer” with specific references to Jesus during meetings. Johnson defended the officials and argued that even in Congress, prayers often contain Christian references, which he called a “logical function of the nation’s demographics.” During a deposition, Johnson peppered one of the plaintiffs about what type of prayer would be acceptable in county meetings. “So if someone might be offended by virtually any prayer, should we just get rid of prayer entirely?” he asked. An appeals court ruled against Johnson’s arguments in 2011, though the Supreme Court later ruled in favor of allowing such prayers in a separate case. “I think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government,” Parker said of Johnson. Homosexuality was a frequent topic for Johnson, which he has called “inherently unnatural” and a “dangerous lifestyle.” In addition to suggesting he hopes the Supreme Court will reverse its decision allowing same-sex marriage, he also wrote in support of Texas’ anti-sodomy laws, which said gay men caught having sex could be fined. “It recognized a fundamental right, a constitutional right to, to sodomy, which had never been recognized before,” Johnson said at a forum in 2005 on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas — which struck down the ban on gay sex in that state. Johnson supported an Arkansas law against same-sex couples adopting children, citing it as “good public policy” in 2008. In 2013, he opposed President Barack Obama’s appointment of an “openly homosexual” ambassador, Wally Brewster, to the Dominican Republic, calling it a provocative move against the Catholic country. In 2015, transitioning from his role at ADF to a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, Johnson sparked national controversy with the “Marriage and Conscience Act.” The bill aimed to protect individuals objecting to same-sex marriage on religious grounds but faced opposition from Johnson’s hometown editorial board, business leaders and even Republicans in the state legislature. Critics argued it could enable discrimination against LGBTQ individuals by businesses. Following backlash, the bill never reached a vote. In response to the bill’s failure, then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, issued a similar executive order. “Apparently, defending religious liberty makes one ‘anti-gay’ now,” Johnson wrote on Facebook amid debate on the bill. Just two years later, Johnson moved from the state legislature to Congress where he’s maintained a 92% rating from the CPAC Center for Legislative Accountability – 11% higher than the average Republican in 2022. In Congress, Johnson signed on to some of the toughest anti-abortion bills, such as a 2021 so-called “heartbeat bill,” which would essentially outlaw abortion after six weeks. He has repeatedly called states that allow abortion “pro-death” states. “It is truly an American holocaust,” Johnson said in May 2022 on local DC radio. “The reality is that Planned Parenthood and all these big abortion (providers), they set up their clinics in inner cities. They regard these people as easy prey. I mean, it’s true.” Johnson also supported plans to change Medicare and Social Security benefits while increasing the retirement age, emphasizing urgency in addressing escalating entitlement. He has blamed booming entitlements costs in part on abortion. “And you don’t have 40 or 50 million able-bodied workers in the economy,” Johnson said on a podcast he co-hosts with his wife. “That would be paying taxes into the system to be able to support their elderly, you know, neighbors and friends.” On numerous occasions, Johnson also voiced approval for a Louisiana state trigger law – passed in 2006 – which banned abortion without exceptions for rape and incest the day Roe v. Wade was overturned. “I’m grateful to be from Louisiana, one of the dozen states or so that has a trigger law that will automatically become an abortion free state, pro-life,” Johnson said in 2022. In 2022, Johnson introduced a bill that some described as a national version of what critics call Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The bill never made it out of committee. For Johnson and those who share his worldview, such policies have spiritual implications not only for individuals but the entire nation, said Philip Gorski, a professor and chair of the sociology department at Yale University who has studied Christian nationalism. “There is much more at stake for Johnson and others who crome from that conservative Christian subculture,” he said. “There is this view the United States is a Christian nation which has entered into a sacred covenant with God that involves upholding certain standards of Christian morality, and when those standards are violated, when those precepts are broken, it threatens the entire country with divine wrath and all kinds of decline.” Following Trump’s 2020 reelection defeat, Johnson played a pivotal role in efforts to overturn the election – urging his colleagues to sign onto the Texas Attorney General’s longshot lawsuit aiming to throw out the results in key swing states. “It was rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Supreme Court,” Eisen told CNN, but Johnson was willing to  “perpetuate the loser as the winner and to twist the law and the facts to support that.” Johnson also endorsed some fringe conspiracies, including the unsubstantiated belief that voting software machines were manipulated. On January 6, 2021, Johnson voted to object the election results, later saying he was doing his “duty to uphold the Constitution.” For Johnson, the vote to keep Trump in office reflected a striking evolution from his past critique of Trump in 2015, whom, as first reported by the New York Times, he openly labeled as “dangerous,” lacking “character,” and devoid of a “moral center.” It was the apex of the transactional relationship between the religious right and former TV star. During a church service in 2022, reflecting on the conclusion of Roe v. Wade, Johnson remarked that much of the credit belonged to Trump. “There is a lot of credit to go around, but you have to acknowledge, Donald Trump for all of his, peccadillos, okay? Bless him,” Johnson said. “He was true to his word.”",US Politics
Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election – they’re now part of a ‘robust’ state investigation," They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes. By that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors. Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media. Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona. Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN. “They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.” Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice. “It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.” All 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed. Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee. Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol. “The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN. Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president. CNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them. The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results. “We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents. Ward’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act. “My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22. Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies. “It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents. In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence. “It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet. “We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback. A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors. Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6. “Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol. The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ. Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature. “It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman. In interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent. Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector. “On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December. “There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added. Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN. “Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said. Kern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol. “In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet. Later Kern was seen in a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.",US Politics
Georgia judge declines to send Trump co-defendant in election fraud case to jail over social media posts," The judge overseeing the Fulton County election racketeering case declined Tuesday to send one of Donald Trump’s co-defendants to jail over recent social media posts and other comments he made targeting witnesses. Judge Scott McAfee said that while the defendant, Harrison Floyd, made “technical violations” of his bond agreement, “not every violation compels revocation.” The judge, however, modified Floyd’s bond agreement, adding a restriction on his social media activity. Floyd is prohibited from making any social media post “of any kind on any platform, whether public or private, concerning any codefendant or witness in this case or concerning any person specifically named in the indictment,” according to the modified bond agreement. Fulton County prosecutors had asked McAfee to revoke Floyd’s bond, arguing that he’s violated the terms of the agreement meant to keep him out of jail because of his alleged “effort to intimidate codefendants and witnesses.” Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis personally argued the case Tuesday, the first time she has appeared in court for a pre-trial hearing in the sprawling election subversion racketeering case. “What we are really here to decide today is does this order mean something or not. He does not get an ‘oh, I’m sorry,’ after I’ve already intimidated the witnesses in this case,” Willis said. “It is too late.” Had McAfee granted prosecutors’ requests, Floyd would have been the first defendant to be jailed for their actions related to the case – a move that would have sent a strong message to the other defendants that prosecutors are closely watching their public maneuverings as the criminal case unfolds. “He was given an opportunity to cooperate with the rules of this case and what he really did was spit on the court and refuse to oblige by three of the seven conditions of this bond order,” Willis said. Floyd, who has pleaded not guilty to three state felonies, has before been behind bars after being indicted earlier this year. The only defendant to have spent time in jail in connection with the case, Floyd was incarcerated at the Fulton County Jail for one week in August before reaching a bond deal with prosecutors. The felonies Floyd faces in the case are largely tied to his role in an intimidation campaign targeting two Atlanta election workers in late 2020. Trump and his allies falsely accused the workers of massive voter fraud. The leader of Black Voices for Trump, Floyd was separately charged in May with simple assault of a federal officer who was delivering a subpoena to him to testify before a grand jury in Washington, DC. He has not entered a plea in that case. Floyd’s attorneys on Monday pushed back hard against prosecutors’ bid to jail him, telling McAfee that they were doing so out of retaliation after he rejected a plea deal offer. They also draw comparisons to Trump’s public comments about the case, suggesting that prosecutors’ decision to not go after Trump was evidence of a double standard. “A review of President Trump’s social media posts make the State’s decision to go after Harrison Floyd hard to justify,” Floyd’s attorneys wrote, citing several posts from Trump about Sidney Powell, an attorney who recently pleaded guilty in the case, as well as Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff and current co-defendant. “None of these posts amount to a threat or intimidation,” Floyd’s attorney Chris Kachouroff said of his client’s posts on Tuesday, noting that none of the witnesses presented in court contacted authorities about the case. “We need to give Floyd the benefit of the doubt,” Kachouroff later added. “Did he walk up close to the line? Yes.” In their request last week, Fulton County prosecutors highlighted Floyd’s recent social media posts about Georgia election officials who are likely to be called as witnesses in the case, as well as his recent comments on a conservative podcast about Jenna Ellis, who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. “The Defendant’s actions demonstrate that he poses a significant threat of intimidating witnesses and otherwise obstructing the administration of justice in the future, making him ineligible for bond,” they wrote in the court filing. In one recent post, Floyd questioned why his team was accused of leaking videos of conversations between another defendant and prosecutors, invoking Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman, who is a witness in the case. “Why would my team leak Jenna Ellis & proffer videos when there is better stuff? For instance, Ruby Freeman’s job was the reconciliation of ballots,” he wrote. “She wasn’t even supposed to be on a scanner !!!!!!” Michael Hill, an assistant chief investigator in Fulton County testified about Floyd’s recent social media posts on X about the case, with the witnesses reading aloud each post, at times taking care to translate internet-speak to adhere to courtroom decorum. “The content is as follows: ‘Black American Dems want the ‘Black Trump Guy’ to tell on the ‘RACIST WHITE REPUBLICANS’ but only if it’s President Trump? Lol, look, the truth is that @GASecofState and @GabrielSterling are the pieces of’ – and it’s a …” Hill read, before Willis interjected. “Emoji – can you just spell that word as opposed to putting profanity in the record,” she said. “Yes, ma’am. It’s an emoji of poop or fecal matter emoji,” Hill said. “’They are the pieces of – that emoji – you should be mad at.’” Later during the hearing, Willis called Gabriel Sterling, an election official in the state who testified that while it’s common for people to tag him in posts on X, he generally doesn’t put much stock into the public comments directed at him. “It’s par for the course when you’re a public figure,” Sterling told Floyd’s attorney when he asked if his client’s posts are “threatening and intimidating” to him. State witness Von DuBose, who represents Ruby Freeman, a witness in the racketeering case, said that social media posts about his client have caused her to take some precautions, including relocating from her home. He said that Floyd’s posts about Freeman have led to a “spike” in online activity targeting Freeman. “This is the beginning of potential threats,” he said, adding that their concerns resulted in them taking more security precautions for Freeman.

University of Tampa is the seventh college facing a Department of Education investigation in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war," The University of Tampa and a Florida school district, Hillsborough County Schools, are the latest schools to face an investigation by the Department of Education related to alleged incidents of discrimination. The investigations were made public Tuesday by the department, which added them to an online list of ongoing investigations – which is growing in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. It also announced a second investigation into New York’s Columbia University. Last week, the Department of Education launched investigations into six colleges – including Columbia, Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania – and one K-12 school over alleged incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia. The investigations were launched by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, universities and K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide all students with an environment free from discrimination. Any person or organization can file a Title VI complaint with the Office for Civil Rights. The agency is now conducting an unprecedented number of hate investigations, according to a department official. The situation is becoming untenable for the Office for Civil Rights, which the official told CNN doesn’t have the investigative staff to match the influx of cases. “Seeing the proliferation of hate on school campuses, we find it astonishing and scary,” the official said. The Office for Civil Rights has now opened a total of 27 Title VI investigations this year. Fifteen similar investigations were opened last year and just two were opened in 2021. The office also investigates other kinds of rights violations, including those regarding sexual harassment. “They (the Department of Education) are very clearly trying to demonstrate that they are moving quickly to respond to concerns they’ve heard from the public, from Congress and from the administration,” said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations and national engagement at the American Council on Education. The organization represents more than 1,700 colleges and universities. “They have made it clear that they are going to be taking a very, very vigilant role on the issue of antisemitism on college campuses,” he added. The Office for Civil Rights aims to resolve investigations within six months. Schools could ultimately lose federal funding if they don’t comply with the office’s recommendations, but investigations typically end with the school agreeing to address the incident or making policy changes if there is a systemic problem. The University of Tampa said that the investigation stems from an incident that occurred in September – before the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel – and was addressed by the university. “The university is fully cooperating with the request for information, but cannot comment further due to student privacy laws,” it said. Columbia University said it would cooperate with any investigation. Hillsborough County Schools did not immediately respond to requests for comment. College campuses have seen a rise in tension over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. A Cornell University student was federally charged in connection with a series of online posts threatening to kill and harm Jewish students, and the University of Pennsylvania recently alerted the FBI to a series of threatening, antisemitic emails sent to the Ivy League school’s staff. Complaints filed earlier this month by the Brandeis Center, a Jewish civil rights legal organization, led the Office for Civil Rights to open investigations into the University of Pennsylvania and Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Kenneth Marcus, founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center, told CNN he thinks the Office for Civil Rights could be doing more. He also headed the office under the Trump administration. “It’s just a drop in the bucket when you compare the number of investigations to the number of incidents we’re seeing across the country,” Marcus said. “This reflects only a tiny percentage of problems out there,” he added. Earlier this month, the Department of Education issued guidance to colleges and K-12 schools, reminding them that they have a legal obligation to address incidents of discrimination – including against those who are Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab or Palestinian. The department also recently updated its discrimination complaint form, specifying that Title VI’s protection from discrimination based on race, color or national origin extends to students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or Sikh, or based on other shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.

Colorado Supreme Court to hear appeals in 14th Amendment challenge to Trump’s candidacy," The Colorado Supreme Court has agreed to hear appeals in a 14th Amendment challenge to former President Donald Trump’s candidacy and scheduled oral arguments for December 6. Trump’s team and the group trying to remove him from the Colorado ballot based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” appealed different parts of last week’s lower-court ruling, which found that Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but that the ban doesn’t apply to the presidency. Many experts believe the case, which was brought by Republican and independent voters in coordination with a liberal-leaning watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, will eventually reach the US Supreme Court in some fashion. Colorado District Court Judge Sarah Wallace issued a stunning 102-page decision Friday, that found Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but concluded that the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” doesn’t apply to presidents, based on the text of the amendment, which was ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War. It says American officials who take an oath to support the Constitution are banned from future office if they “engaged in insurrection.” The provision explicitly bans insurrectionists from serving as US senators, representatives and even presidential electors – but it does not say anything about the presidency. It says it covers “any office, civil or military, under the United States,” and Wallace ruled that this does not include the office of the presidency. That key finding is what the anti-Trump challengers hope the Colorado Supreme Court will overturn. “No court should adopt an interpretation of the Constitution that has such absurd results,” the challengers wrote in their appeal filing. “Fortunately, in this case, the text and history all comport with the common-sense outcome. Section 3 does not disqualify oath-breaking insurrectionists from nearly all public offices except the highest one, nor does it give a unique free pass to insurrectionist Presidents.” All seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court were appointed by Democratic governors. Six of the seven subsequently won statewide retention elections to stay on the bench. The seventh was only appointed in 2021 and hasn’t faced voters yet. Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the anti-Trump challengers, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday that he was “hopeful” his appeal will prevail in overturning the “one issue” that the judge “got wrong” about who the ban does – and doesn’t – apply to. “We’re going to pursue our claims in court. I think we put on a very good case, the judge issued a very detailed and thorough opinion – it took until page 95 of a 102-page opinion for her to rule against us on anything, so we’re just going to continue forward. We’re going to go to the Colorado Supreme Court and see what happens there.” In other portions of Wallace’s ruling, she offered a searing condemnation of Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. She concluded that the former president “actively primed the anger of his extremist supporters” and “acted with the specific intent to incite political violence and direct it at the Capitol.” Trump has prevailed in similar constitutional challenges in several states, including Michigan and Minnesota, though other appeals are underway. “It was an outrageous attempt at disenfranchising millions and millions of voters by getting us thrown off the ballot,” Trump said Saturday at a campaign rally in Iowa. “We’ve now beat the radical Democrats’ election-rigging ballot qualification scam in Colorado and Michigan and Minnesota and New Hampshire and other states.” Trump also has appealed the decision, taking issue with several of the judge’s findings, including that he “engaged” in the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s lawyers say Wallace reached the “correct” conclusion that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to presidents. However, they asked the Colorado Supreme Court to overturn her other decisions, arguing she “committed multiple grave jurisdictional and legal errors … creating new, unprecedented, and unsupported legal standards in applying” the constitutional disqualification clause. The lawyers said in a court filing that they want these matters corrected now because of the possibility of “further review” in the case, referring to the widely expected eventual appeals to the Supreme Court.

Iowa evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats endorses DeSantis’ presidential bid," Bob Vander Plaats, a key evangelical leader in Iowa, officially announced his endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday. “I’m thrilled to throw my personal endorsement and support behind Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida,” he said in a Fox News interview. Vander Plaats, the CEO and President of The Family Leader, has clashed with former President Donald Trump and urged Republicans to move on from the former president while heaping praise on DeSantis. A longtime GOP powerbroker, he has thrown his weight behind the eventual winner of the past three Iowa caucuses not to feature an incumbent Republican president. Vander Plaats said he had leaned toward DeSantis from the outset of the primary due to his strong performance in the 2022 midterm elections, winning Florida by a sizable margin while Republicans around the country largely underperformed expectations. But he said DeSantis “closed the sale” during his appearance at The Family Leader’s Thanksgiving Family Forum event in Iowa last week. “He was very clear about, we need a president who can serve two terms, not one term. We don’t need a president that’s gonna be a lame duck on day one,” Vander Plaats said. In a tweet, DeSantis thanked Vander Plaats for his endorsement, characterizing support from the Christian leader as a sign that Iowa evangelicals “can trust me to fight and win for them.” “As I’ve made my way through 98 of Iowa’s 99 counties, Iowans have shared what a critical role @bobvanderplaats plays in engaging Iowa’s faith community in the key battles that matter. His support tells Iowans they can trust me to fight and win for them,” he wrote in a social media post. The backing from Vander Plaats comes after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds endorsed DeSantis as the Florida governor has focused his campaign’s strategy on Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses. He previously said that he has discussed a possible endorsement with Reynolds. Vander Plaats told Fox that he believes his endorsement, combined with the endorsement from Reynolds, could propel DeSantis to success in Iowa, and speculated it could give him momentum in subsequent primaries. “I think Gov. Reynolds’ endorsement of Ron DeSantis is a key play in the state of Iowa. And if Iowa launches a Ron DeSantis, I think it gives New Hampshire a new look, South Carolina new look, and you have a real primary that’s going to take place,” he said. News Nation was first to report the news of the expected endorsement. On the same day as Vander Plaats’ expected announcement, Trump’s campaign said that more than 150 faith leaders in Iowa had backed the former president. “This announcement is not just a number; it’s a powerful message that faith communities trust President Trump to lead our nation forward with integrity and moral clarity,” Dan McCoy, senior pastor at First Baptist Church in Urbandale, Iowa, said in a news release from the campaign. Vander Plaats said he believes the Republican primary is a “two-person race” between DeSantis and Trump and acknowledged that the former president winning the Iowa caucuses would put him in a strong position to become the eventual nominee. But he said he believes the state is “tailor-made” for DeSantis to win. “If President Trump wins Iowa here, I think it’s going to be awfully hard to make the case that you can beat President Trump, and he’s gonna be your eventual nominee,” he said. “But I think America would be well served to have a choice, and I really believe Ron DeSantis is that guy and I think Iowa’s tailor-made for him to win this.” This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",US Politics
House Judiciary GOP subpoenas assistant US attorney involved in Hunter Biden probe," The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed an assistant US attorney on the Hunter Biden criminal case, according to a copy of the subpoena reviewed by CNN. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan initially requested testimony from Assistant US Attorney Lesley Wolf in June along with a number of Justice Department officials involved in the Hunter Biden criminal investigation. The Department of Justice has made six high-level officials, including special counsel David Weiss, available to testify, but has not allowed the panel to interview Wolf. In the subpoena letter, Jordan called the DOJ’s reasons for withholding Wolf’s testimony “unpersuasive.” DOJ declined to comment to CNN on the subpoena. Whistleblowers with the Internal Revenue Service have told Congress they believe that Wolf deviated from protocol on several occasions throughout the case and stymied their efforts to obtain subpoenas and search warrants, allegations that Republicans have seized on. During his closed-door interview with Congress earlier this month, Weiss defended Wolf. “From my perspective, the prosecutors who participated in this case followed the law and the facts, that was the motivation,” Weiss said, adding that Wolf is a “dedicated public servant for more than 16 years,” an “excellent lawyer” and “a person of integrity.” Republicans have set December 7 as Wolf’s deposition date. Jordan argues that Wolf’s testimony is also relevant to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, and previously told CNN she was one of the individuals he wanted to interview before he could wrap up his part of the inquiry. “Given your critical role you played in the investigation of Hunter Biden, you are uniquely situated to shed light on whether President Biden played any role in the Department’s investigation and whether he attempted, in any way, to directly or indirectly obstruct either that investigation or our investigation,” Jordan wrote. CNN’s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.",US Politics
Two more House lawmakers announce they won’t run for reelection," Two House lawmakers announced on Tuesday that they won’t run for reelection, the latest in a string of members of Congress heading for the exits. Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California said in a video message that she will not seek reelection in 2024, bringing to an end a more than 30-year career in Congress. Later in the day, Republican Rep. Bill Johnson of Ohio wrote on X that he “will not be seeking an 8th term in Congress,” and said he has accepted an offer to lead Youngstown State University. Johnson said he will “continue serving in the House for several more months.” CNN has reached out to his office to ask when he plans to leave Congress. Eshoo, who was first elected to Congress in 1992, currently represents California’s 16th Congressional District, a Silicon Valley Democratic stronghold. She is also a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and served for a decade on the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors before coming to Washington. Another California Democrat – Rep. Tony Cardenas – announced on Monday that he will also not seek reelection in 2024. “I’m choosing this beautiful season of Thanksgiving to announce that I will not seek reelection – and I do so with a heart filled with unending gratitude,” Eshoo said in her video message. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement, “For more than three decades, Rep. Anna Eshoo has ably represented her constituents in the Bay Area during an era of tremendous growth and change. As a Member of Congress, Anna has exemplified Silicon Valley’s hallmark innovation and brilliance at every step of her public service journey.” Eshoo said in her video announcement that she will continue “with vigor and unswerving commitment” as she serves out her remaining time in Congress.

White House declassifies intel suggesting Wagner Group is preparing to provide air defense capability to Hezbollah or Iran," The White House released recently declassified intelligence on Tuesday confirming that the Russian mercenary organization Wagner group has been preparing to provide an air defense capability “to either Hezbollah or Iran,” according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby. Wagner was preparing to provide the capability at the direction of the Russian government, Kirby said. The newly downgraded intelligence did not specify where the missile system would be coming from. But CNN previously reported that the Wagner Group had been tasked with carrying out the delivery of a surface-to-air SA-22 missile system from Syria to the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad agreed to provide Hezbollah with the Russian-made missile defense system, known as a Pantsir, two people familiar with the intelligence told CNN last month. “We will closely monitor for whether Wagner provides military equipment to Hezbollah or Iran,” Kirby said. “We are prepared to use our counterterrorism sanctions authorities against Russian individuals or entities making these destabilizing transfers.” Russia’s role in directing the transfer of an air defense system to Hezbollah reflects Moscow’s ongoing arms relationship with Iran and its proxies, which has only strengthened since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The US is also concerned that Iran is preparing to provide Russia with ballistic missiles, which Iran showcased to Russian Defense Minister Shoigu during the latter’s visit to Tehran in September, Kirby said on Tuesday. Wagner and Hezbollah fighters have also both operated in Syria for years, where they have been working alongside Russian and Syrian armed forces to bolster the Assad regime against the Syrian opposition. Hezbollah began to pull its fighters out in recent years, but the group is also backed by Iran, which is a close Assad ally. A source familiar with western intelligence told CNN previously that there has been evidence of increasing collaboration between Hezbollah and Wagner in Syria. The possibility that Hezbollah could soon have a new air defense system comes amid concerns that the militants are considering opening a new front in Israel’s war on Hamas, on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. The US has repeatedly warned Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups to stay out of the conflict and has positioned aircraft carriers and troops in the region to try to deter against a potential escalation. Still, Iran-backed militia groups have launched over 60 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, prompting the US to respond with strikes on the militants. The US intelligence community has assessed that Iran has been calibrating its response to Israel’s military intervention in Gaza to avoid direct conflict with Israel or the US, while still exacting costs on its adversaries via its proxy groups, CNN has reported. But Iran does not maintain perfect control of its umbrella of these proxy groups, officials say—in particular over Hezbollah. Hezbollah is an ally of Hamas, the group that attacked Israel on October 7, and has long positioned itself as fighting against Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in cross-border strikes on each other in northern Israel and southern Lebanon over the last month, but US officials believe Hezbollah is for now not planning on entering the war in force.",US Politics
House Speaker Johnson meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago," House Speaker Mike Johnson met with former President Donald Trump Monday night at Mar-a-Lago, according to a GOP source familiar with the meeting. Johnson was at Mar-a-Lago for a fundraiser for GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida, according to two Trump advisers. Johnson and Trump met briefly, the advisers said, and Johnson was not there solely for a meeting with Trump. The meeting at the former president’s Florida resort comes nearly a week after the newly minted speaker publicly endorsed Trump’s 2024 bid for the White House, becoming the highest-ranking Republican so far to do so. It was not immediately clear what the pair discussed during the meeting. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, is a longtime Trump ally and served on the former president’s impeachment team, though the role was largely ceremonial. He voted to sustain the objection to electoral votes on January 6, 2021. Last week, Johnson, who said he has endorsed Trump “wholeheartedly,” told CNBC that he was “one of the closest allies that President Trump had in Congress” and that the former president had “a phenomenal first term.” Trump remains the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, with a significant lead over his GOP rivals. The congressman benefitted from Trump’s support in his successful bid for speaker last month, after the former president had come out against the Republican conference’s brief speaker-nominee Tom Emmer, calling the Minnesota Republican a “Globalist RINO” and saying that voting for him “would be a tragic mistake.” CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Jack Forrest contributed to this report.",US Politics
These young Michigan voters are divided on Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war and aren’t guaranteeing him their votes," Midterms are over and finals are just ahead in a semester that included a big new experiment for Wayne State sophomore Maya Siegmann: “I joined the breakdancing club.” “I’m learning a new skill,” Siegmann said with a smile. “That kind of shocks people a little bit. Unexpected. But it’s really fun.” It is not, though, the biggest change for Siegmann this fall. She is active in the Jewish campus organization Hillel and her frequent visits to its lounge and library now include greeting the police officer standing watch outside. It is part of the new normal here since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel. “That we need to have a police officer outside the office, it is upsetting,” said the soft-spoken Siegmann, who’s studying to be a social worker. “There is definitely a divide between the pro-Palestine students and the pro-Israel students,” said Siegmann. “The division is very clear. The tension on campus is very high.” Wayne State is a sprawling 200-acre campus in downtown Detroit, a place that takes pride in being part of a great American city’s resurgence. The 24,000 students are a diverse melting pot and the urban location means campus politics tilt decidedly blue. It is a community where support for abortion rights runs high. And LGBTQ rights. College costs come up a lot in conversations. The climate crisis, too. It is an issue mix that favors Democrats, and Wayne State is among campuses critical to President Joe Biden’s Michigan win in 2020 and big gains by Democrats here in 2022. At the moment, though, there’s a Democratic divide over the Israel-Hamas conflict and Biden’s handing of the crisis. CNN recently visited Michigan as part of a new project designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key areas – in this case, young voters. “I am an Israeli Jewish Israeli American,” is how Siegmann describes herself. She took a break from campus to join last week’s march in support of Israel in Washington, DC – part of a very sudden shift to political activism. “Politics is not something that really interests me,” she said. “But I am advocating for the Jewish population because I want to make other students feel more safe and more comfortable. Because that’s just, that’s not where we are right now.” Siegmann hears the condemnation of Israel from friends and classmates, along with the calls for Biden to demand a ceasefire in Gaza because of the mounting toll on Palestinian civilians. “A ceasefire is a way for Hamas to re-up their supplies,” she said. “A ceasefire will just allow them to resupply and attack at a later time.” A lot of the conversations on campus – and on students’ social media – are black and white. Often lost in the anger and emotion is important nuance. Siegmann, for example, said: “I stand with Israel. … Right now, the most important thing is defending their right to exist.” But Siegmann takes issue with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on several issues, including corruption concerns and his handling of the Palestinians. “I would just like to live in peace with our neighbors,” she said. “There are a lot of problems within Israel,” but for now she added, “That’s kind of on a side burner.” Siegmann is happy with Biden’s handling of the crisis, but he isn’t guaranteed her vote next November, even though he won it in 2020. “I think that there should be an age cap on people in office,” she said of the president, who turned 81 on Monday. “He is very supportive of Israel, which I’m very grateful for, but I would like someone who’s younger in office.” First-year Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal is another Biden 2020 voter whose support in 2024 is at risk, to say the least. “Not in a million years would I like to vote for (Donald) Trump,” Ghazal said in an interview. “I don’t know if I am voting at all. But I definitely will not be voting for Biden.” We asked Ghazal if he agreed with an image on the front page of an Arab American newspaper: activists holding “Abandon Biden” placards to illustrate a story harshly critical of the president’s handling of the crisis. “To an extent, yes,” Ghazal said. “I feel as though President Biden does not value my life as a Muslim American as much as he values other lives.” The White House earlier this month announced the development of a national strategy to combat Islamophobia. And the president has urged Israel to exercise restraint in its response to minimize civilian deaths and ease humanitarian suffering. But Biden has rejected calls for a ceasefire, instead stressing his commitment to a two-state solution in a Washington Post op-ed over the weekend. Ghazal lives in Detroit. But our conversation was in neighboring Dearborn, at a Yemeni coffee house where he often meets friends. Community is a passion of Ghazal’s, who founded the Detroit Muslim Running Club to build a healthier community in Michigan. More than half of Dearborn’s residents are of Arab ancestry and Biden won 74% of the city’s vote in 2020. “What’s going to make him hear us is our vote,” Ghazal said. “That’s going to make a difference for him in a swing state.” Ghazal’s views of Netanyahu are scathing, and he sees Biden as greenlighting an Israeli military campaign Ghazal calls disproportionate and indiscriminate. “I’m Muslim. I’m American. I’m Palestinian,” is how Ghazal describes himself. “I care because I am an American and I don’t think our country should fund that type of a reaction.” Ghazal is blunt. “I’m speaking about an occupation – a brutal occupation that we fund,” he said. Most of the international community, including the United States, considers Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights to be occupied territories. Ghazal called antisemitism “horrible” and “disgusting.” But he also sees Islamophobia and ignorance at play in the criticism of Palestinians who condemn the Israeli military response. “It’s disgusting that standing up for children dying and women dying and civilian infrastructure being destroyed is being compared to supporting Hamas,” Ghazal said. “Holding up a Palestinian flag does not support Hamas. Hamas has their own flag. Nobody’s carrying their flag.” His long-term hopes align with those of Siegmann – though, like her, Ghazal sees only tense times ahead. “All I want is a pathway to peace,” Ghazal said. “For Palestinians to reach a peaceful solution where Jews, Muslims and Christians and any person can live peacefully together.” Our visit to Michigan, and college campuses in Detroit and Ann Arbor, was part of our reporting project’s effort to check in with young voters, who were a vital piece of the Biden coalition in 2020 and were also part of a strong 2022 midterm year for Democrats in Michigan. Summer Matkin could only watch then, but the 18-year-old is looking forward to casting her first votes in the 2024 cycle. “I’m finally here and I’m able to vote,” said Matkin, a theater major in her first semester at Wayne State. “I registered over the summer.” Matkin is an esports enthusiast and has used her film and social media skills to help raise money to fight hunger and for the Trevor Project, which provides support services to LGTBQ young people. She says she has not had time this first semester to join any of the campus protests, but “Free Palestine is something I would 100% believe in.” Matkin did not register with a political party but said, “My ideals lean more Democratic or liberal side.” If there is a Trump-Biden rematch, “I’d go Biden,” Matkin said. But she would prefer younger candidates, and listed New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as someone she’d like to see lead the party in the future. “I feel like there’s a detachment for young people with an older president,” she said. “I think there is a very weird separation or maybe generational gap, so, when there’s certain things we want to be heard as young people. … Not only the conflict out there with Israeli and Palestinian people but we also have student loan forgiveness and all of these different financial problems.” The University of Michigan’s main campus in Ann Arbor, with twice as many students as Wayne State, is also rife with tension. About 40 students were arrested Friday night, according to the university. The protest was organized by Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, a local chapter of the national group Students for Justice in Palestine. The Friday protest at a school administration building was one of a series of demonstrations the group has organized. Another asked students to write the names of Palestinians killed in Gaza on a giant poster. “We are in the middle of our fight for escalation with the administration,” said Joseph Fisher, a history major and a leader of the group. “One of our demands that we’re pressuring for right now is complete divestment from the state of Israel and weapons manufacturers that are complicit in the genocide that’s happening in Gaza.” Fisher emphatically rejects the idea that Israel has a right to use military force to respond to a terrorist attack. “It is absolutely essential that we call it for what it is – a genocide – and also say that it didn’t start on October 7,” Fisher said. “It started in 1948 with the creation of the settler colonial state of Israel. … I think we as students in the United States, people from across the world and Palestinian freedom fighters are fighting for the liberation of their homeland. I think we need to say how it is.” Tensions between Israelis and the Palestinians have existed since before Israel’s founding in 1948. United Nations experts warned this weekend that “grave violations” against Palestinians in Gaza “point to genocide in the making.” But Israel rejects allegations of genocide and maintained that it has a right to defend itself, which Biden has supported. The White House has also pushed back on protesters who are accusing Israel of committing genocide, with National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Monday saying, “What Hamas wants, make no mistake about it, is genocide.” Some Jewish students say language like Fisher’s – and beliefs like that – contribute to the spike in antisemitism. Fisher was not in Michigan in 2020, when overwhelming support among college students helped Biden flip the state from red in 2016 back to blue. He was just 17 then, back in his native Georgia, where, out of fear of Trump, he volunteered to help the American Civil Liberties Union register voters. Georgia was another flip and a pivotal win for Biden. But Fisher, who is Black, will not be helping the president this time. Nor, at least as of today, will Biden get his first vote for president. Instead, Fisher said he is currently leaning toward supporting the Party for Socialism and Liberation. “I haven’t seen any change in my life and the lives of other people marginalized in this country in the last four years,” he said. “I will not vote for Joe Biden at this time.” The College Democrats at Ann Arbor try to meet weekly, and this past week’s focus was on political communication skills. Seniors Anushka Jalisatgi and Jade Gray were part of the Democrats’ success on campus in 2020 and 2022, and they said interest in the organization is up, in part because of anger at the Supreme Court decision tossing out the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling. Until recently, their biggest challenge preparing for 2024 was questions about Biden’s age. “Absolutely it comes out,” Gray said. “It’s a real point to make. It’s a real conversation to be had.” Her strategy? Expand the focus. “You’re not just voting for Biden,” Gray said. “You are voting for his entire administration. … You are voting for who he will appoint to the Supreme Court.” Jalisatgi brings in the second prong. “What’s more important is, when we look at, when we turn on the TV and we look at the Republican primary debate or we look at Donald Trump’s speeches and we see what our alternative is,” Jalisatgi said. “It really emphasizes to us that, you know, you’re not just voting for the top of the ticket. You are voting for so much more.” A Tufts University study after the 2022 midterms credited Michigan as the state with the highest turnout of voters ages 18-29. Jalisatgi said her “ambitious goal” is to beat that turnout in 2024. But both she and Gray acknowledged the Israel-Hamas crisis – and Biden’s response – were the source of considerable tension, and even talk of sitting out or looking for a third-party option next year. “Some of them, yes, have shared with us that maybe this is making me reconsider,” Jalisatgi said. Gray made clear her personal view. “You know, Mr. President, I’ve seen you take key humanitarian steps, but I think the next step is a ceasefire. And I think that would go a long way with voters.” Their hope is that the national conversation is back to more favorable ground for Biden by next fall, and that those mad at the president now are more willing to look at the bigger picture then. But things are raw at the moment. Jalisatgi laughed and said “yes” when asked if she is glad the election is not tomorrow. “We’re glad the election is not tomorrow because of how emotionally charged and deeply personal this is,” Gray added. “It’s hard right now.”",US Politics
Fears grow in Congress over Ukraine and Israel aid amid dispute over immigration and spending cuts," President Joe Biden made an urgent plea over the weekend for US support to bolster Ukraine and Israel at a time of war, saying the world faces “an inflection point” that could set the course for the next generation. But on Capitol Hill, the prospects of any such aid package for the two countries appear as grim as ever. “We may not have a supplemental,” Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, said matter-of-factly of the national security package stalled in Congress if an immigration dispute couldn’t be worked out. Unlike other instances where Congress tends to quickly approve urgently needed aid, lawmakers in both parties are now openly questioning whether an emergency package for Israel and Ukraine can get done at all. The House and the Senate are badly split over whether to continue supporting  Ukraine – and now the intractable issue of immigration policy has been injected into the center of the talks. Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer want to keep funding for the two countries in one big package – a position opposed by the new speaker, Mike Johnson, whose bill to provide only Israel with funding along with IRS cuts was quickly rejected by Senate Democrats. Johnson has continued to insist that any emergency package include spending cuts to offset its price tag, a complicated task to pull off and a demand rarely made by party leaders since doing so could bog down urgently needed funding. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Johnson insist that GOP support for more Ukraine funding is contingent on ﻿tightening immigration laws amid growing concerns about security at the border with Mexico. Yet finding an immigration deal that will satisfy House Republicans – and won’t cause a full-on revolt on the left – seems highly unlikely at best, lawmakers concede. “I think it’s a triple bank shot to do something that we haven’t done in 40 years as a condition to support Ukraine funding,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who is part of the negotiating group on immigration. “I still think the likelihood of success is not hot,” Murphy said, adding that talks are continuing but that “no” he wasn’t confident a deal could be reached. A source familiar with the talks insists that progress is being made and that in-person talks last week on the Hill were  productive. But Republicans have pushed for a border deal that Democrats say too closely reflects the House Republicans’ immigration bill, which included a resumption of construction of former President Donald Trump’s border wall and other policies that have been rejected by most Senate Democrats. The White House’s funding request in October included $13.6 billion in additional funding for the border that would allow the US to hire an additional 1,300 border patrol agents and 1,600 asylum officers who could help speed up the processing of migrants with asylum claims. But Republicans are insisting that they’ll need more than just funding at the border. They want wholesale policy changes including revamping how migrants seek asylum in the United States. One idea being floated is raising the credible fear standard for seeking asylum so that it would be harder for migrants to pursue asylum status to begin with. It’s a process that some Republicans have argued is being abused and leading to a major influx at the southern border. A group of Senate Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma, also released policy changes earlier this month they wanted to see, which included an overhaul of how the Biden Administration manages parole and would require families to be detained together in Department of Homeland Security custody. “We’ve still got to overcome that foundational hurdle,” said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, one of the GOP negotiators. “Our members are absolutely calling for something measurable. They don’t trust the administration to implement just based on funding provisions. We need provisions that have the effect of law to get them to follow through.” The White House’s request also included more than $61 billion for aid to Ukraine, more than $14 billion for Israel, and $7.4 billion for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region. Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a staunch advocate for more Ukraine aid, told CNN late last week that a deal “is a ways away” on immigration. “I’ve got one goal: (it) is to deter people from coming,” Graham said. “And if that’s not the Democratic goal, well, we will not get there.” Senate negotiators say they’re trying to keep the parameters of an immigration negotiation narrow, knowing a comprehensive approach would only further complicate passage of Ukraine aid. But a narrow plan could face a furious backlash from House Republicans, who have made border security and stricter immigration laws a centerpiece of their demands for legislative action. Johnson so far has signaled an openness to Ukraine aid as long as border security is also handled to his satisfaction. But he has yet to fully specify what he would agree to in exchange for advancing Ukraine aid. Hard-right Republicans are warning Johnson not to accept any deal that they consider too weak on immigration in exchange for Ukraine aid, which has dwindling GOP support in the House. Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN last week that an immigration deal he finds watered down would amount to “strike three” for the new speaker – after Johnson infuriated his right-flank over his decision to extend government funding until early next year without any spending cuts. Roy added that the speaker would face a revolt by “not moving actual border security and then trying to claim that you did — if anything happens with respect to trying to move something on the back of Ukraine (aid) and then claiming that it’s securing the border when it doesn’t.” He added: “That will be an unacceptable outcome.” Some hardliners are making even more dire warnings, saying Johnson should abandon Ukraine aid completely. “I know people, especially MAGA, especially the Republican base, they absolutely will be furious with our new speaker if he is tying Ukraine money, billions and billions more money” to border security, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told CNN. “And our speaker is going to tell Americans that Ukraine is on the same level as America’s border? No way. They’re not going to like it.” Greene said that a recent conversation with the speaker did little to satisfy her. “He tried to urge me that ‘Oh, we’ve got to get some wins for our border, Marjorie.’ But I’m not buying it.” But Biden is facing some pressure on the left as well – over Israel. As polls show Democratic support slipping over how Israel is prosecuting its war against Hamas, some progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders want aid to Israel to come with strict conditions. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has released an extensive list of demands for the Israeli government in order to win US financial backing. Those demands include “an end to the indiscriminate bombing,” a “right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes,” “a freeze on settlement expansion” in the West Bank, and no long-term occupation of Gaza by Israeli forces as well as commitments to engage in peace talks. That has prompted pushback in the ranks. “Conditioning aid to Israel will only have one outcome: it would help Hamas in their goal of completely annihilating Israel and the Jewish people. It would weaken America’s national security and our fight against terror,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a prominent Jewish Democrat. “Any legislation that conditions security aid to our key democratic ally, Israel, is a nonstarter and will lose scores of votes.” Other Democrats agree. “We do not need any conditions on military aid to Israel,” said Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a freshman Democrat. The Biden administration and some Republicans on the Hill have argued that aid to Ukraine only strengthens US security. And the administration has sought to project to international partners that the US will stand by Ukraine in its continued fight to preserve its democracy. On Monday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine, telling officials there the “United States of America is with you.” “We will remain with you for the long-haul. What happened here in Ukraine, that not only matters to Ukraine, but it matters to the rest of the world. It certainly matters to the United States of America,” Austin said. But there are no guarantees that Congress can find a path forward as US officials have been warning that funding for Ukraine is almost out. “We are having to make tough decisions right now about the security assistance packages that we are providing to Ukraine because we are coming near the end of the rope and Ukraine continues to be involved in an active, dynamic fight all along that front,” said John Kirby, the White House’s National Security Council spokesman.",US Politics
US Navy jet overshoots runway into water off Hawaii," A US Navy reconnaissance jet with nine crew members aboard crashed into water off the Hawaiian island of Oahu on Monday after overshooting the runway at a US Marine Corps base there, military officials said. There were no casualties aboard the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, a twin-engine multimission patrol and reconnaissance jet with the airframe of a Boeing 737 passenger plane, according to Marine Corps spokesperson 1st Lt. Hailey Harms. Harms said the conditions of the nine personnel aboard were being assessed. Pictures showed the aircraft upright with its wings slightly above the waterline in Kaneohe Bay off Marine Corps Base Hawaii on the main island of Oahu, north of the capital of Honolulu. Visibility was down to around a mile at the time of the incident, with wind gusts up to 21 miles per hour and mist, according to the National Weather Service. The P-8A Poseidon is a workhorse of US Navy operations. It can carry both torpedoes and cruise missiles, while conducting antisubmarine and antisurface warfare and intelligence gathering missions. A statement from the US Navy’s Third Fleet said the jet, based in Whidbey Island, Washington, was “on a detachment in support of maritime homeland defense.” Earlier this year, a P-8A operating over the South China Sea with a CNN crew aboard was intercepted by a Chinese fighter jet in an encounter that saw the Chinese plane come within 500 feet of it. P-8 aircraft are also flown by the Australian, New Zealand, British, Norwegian and Indian militaries, according to Boeing.

Exclusive: This pizza box-sized equipment could be key to Ukraine keeping the lights on this winter," Staring down another frigid winter and desperate to keep the lights on, Ukraine’s power grid operator has surreptitiously imported custom-built equipment designed to withstand Russian electronic warfare attacks with the help of US officials, CNN has learned. Engineers at US tech giant Cisco spent weeks building and stress-testing the new gear in a lab in Austin, Texas, and delivered a prototype to Ukraine in the spring with the help of a US Air Force plane carrying humanitarian aid, according to Cisco. After Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator, Ukrenergo, quietly confirmed the new equipment worked despite Russian attacks on its GPS systems, Cisco shipped dozens of the pizza box-sized hardware kits worth an estimated $1 million to Ukraine, where they were installed across the country, Ukrenergo executives told CNN. The new equipment, which has not been previously reported, could offer a crucial lifeline to Ukraine’s electricity grid, which remains a key target of Russian attacks as the Kremlin’s war enters its second full winter. Russian missile and drone strikes over the last two years have destroyed about 40% of the power substations and related equipment that Ukrenergo operates across the country, the grid operator told CNN. In a rare cyberattack that has only just been made public, hackers connected to Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, caused a power outage in Ukraine in October 2022, according to US experts. “We are anticipating them to continue, especially this winter,” Illia Vitiuk, head of cybersecurity for the Ukrainian security service SBU, said of attempted Russian hacks on power plants. The issue that Cisco aimed to help fix, however, is caused by Russian radio-jammers that interfere with the GPS systems Ukrenergo also relies on to manage the flow of power in Ukraine. The stealthy operation, which was described to CNN by sources inside Cisco, Ukraine and the US government, is the latest example of how the Biden administration has leaned on US corporations to help defend Ukraine while trying to keep Washington at arm’s length from a direct confrontation with Russia. SpaceX has provided satellite coverage used by the Ukrainian military. Microsoft helped move huge Ukrainian government data centers out of the country ahead of the invasion. The CEO of Denver-based data analytics firm Palantir has boasted that the firm’s software has been used for “most of the targeting” by the Ukrainian military in Ukraine. Officials from multiple US agencies played a quiet role in getting the Cisco equipment into Ukraine, sources say. The Pentagon handled the flights, the Department of Energy helped coordinate the equipment’s delivery, and, according to Ukrenergo, the Department of Commerce arranged crucial meetings earlier this year between a handful of US tech executives and managers with Ukrenergo who were eager for new ways to defend their grid from Russian attacks. Over dinner at an upscale steakhouse near Stanford University in February, Ukrenergo executives shared war stories with their contacts at Cisco, which has done business in Ukraine for years. Ukraine’s grid operators were facing a serious but underreported problem, they told their dinner companions: The constant GPS jamming that both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries use to interfere with guided missiles was also disrupting visibility for Ukraine’s power grid operators, who relied on GPS-based clocks to relay information about power flow from one location to another. Sitting at the table that night was Joe Marshall, a veteran researcher at Talos, Cisco’s cyber-intelligence unit, who listened intently as the Ukrainians explained their problem over steaks and drinks. Marshall has spent years protecting electric power systems in Ukraine and elsewhere from sabotage, but he’d never dealt with a problem like Ukrenergo’s. After dinner, Marshall went back to his hotel and racked his brain for a potential solution. “Time was a factor,” he said. “These were people’s lives we were discussing here.” Marshall spent hours watching YouTube videos posted by an electronic-warfare expert, and also got tips from US officials and industrial cybersecurity experts at Cisco and elsewhere. As the world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment, Cisco had resources to spare.  Marshall and his team of more than a dozen engineers got to work molding a very common piece of equipment, called an industrial ethernet switch, to fit the specific needs of the Ukrainian grid. Cisco estimated the cost of building materials and shipping of the switches to be $1 million, but the company said it donated the equipment to Ukrenergo for free. Taras Vasyliv, who oversees power dispatching for Ukrenergo, likened the custom-built switches to a “flashlight” for a surgeon who is trying to operate in the dark. The switch allows an electric substation – which has the crucial task of converting power from high to low voltage – to communicate with other parts of a power grid. Critically, these switches needed to be outfitted with their own internal clocks that could calculate accurate time measurements, providing an element of redundancy and giving grid operators visibility even when GPS systems are down. Otherwise, “you’re blind,” Vasyliv said in a phone interview from Kyiv. Several of his colleagues have been killed during the war, Vasyliv told CNN, as the Russian military has pummeled Ukrenergo infrastructure. But keeping the lights on, and avoiding the next air strike, keeps him going. “Just do your job, and do it very good,” he says he tells himself. Within a few weeks of the dinner in Silicon Valley, Marshall and his team had a prototype developed. To see whether it actually worked, Cisco had to figure out how to get them into Ukraine. Marshall, a former Pentagon IT contractor from Alabama, turned to a US official to find a flight that was leaving from a military base on the East Coast in April. The flight went to Germany before arriving in Rzeszów, Poland, a hub for humanitarian and military support about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border. From there, the prototypes were loaded onto a train to go into Ukraine, where they were quietly delivered to Vasyliv and his team of Ukrenergo engineers. With their offices in Kyiv partially destroyed by shelling, Vasyliv said his engineers tested the switch in a drab office in western Ukraine. “This looked like the startups in California from 1970 [rather] than some very fancy laboratory,” he said. The switches worked, and Cisco ramped up production so that dozens more could get to Ukraine. US officials familiar with the Cisco project were reluctant to discuss specific shipments out of fear of tipping off Russia’s ability to thwart them. The same GRU cyber-sabotage team that has cut the lights in Ukraine, after all, previously damaged computers at logistics companies in Poland that were servicing Ukraine, according to Microsoft. But over the course of three months last winter, the Department of Energy “identified, procured and shipped” nearly 20 tons of electrical equipment to Ukraine on US Air Force cargo planes, the department said in February. Behind the scenes, US officials are often coordinating the delivery of key technology to Ukraine. The US Department of Defense is now paying SpaceX to provide its Starlink satellite service in Ukraine, the department said in July, without disclosing the price of the contract. US officials charged with protecting the US electric sector have also been studying Russia’s digital sabotage of Ukraine’s grid for close to a decade – to help Ukraine but also to ensure US power companies know how to defend against the hacking techniques. When the GRU first used hacking tools to cut power for about 225,000 Ukrainians in the winter of 2015, according to a US indictment and private experts, the Department of Homeland Security flew a team to Ukraine to study the forensics of the attack. Another power-disrupting cyberattack in Ukraine in 2016 showed the Russians were evolving their techniques. On October 10, 2022, the GRU targeted an unnamed Ukrainian electric facility, “causing an unplanned power outage” at the same time the Russian military launched air strikes on electric infrastructure across Ukraine, according to US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which responded to the hack. The extent of any power outage from the hacking was unclear. Ukrainian officials have told CNN it can be difficult to distinguish whether air strikes or hacking causes an outage. But the incident raised the possibility that the Russian hacking unit was getting quicker at developing new tools to disrupt power in Ukraine, hastened by the tempo and demands of war. That cyberattack last year in Ukraine “demonstrates the evolution of improved and faster [operational technology] threat capabilities that could be leveraged in North America,” NERC, the North American grid regulator, said in a statement to CNN, referring to cyber capabilities that target industrial equipment. At least one of the Department of Energy’s elite research labs – which spend millions of dollars annually anticipating new hacking threats to the US grid – will be closely studying the methods the GRU used in the October 2022 hack in Ukraine, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.",US Politics
US Defense Secretary Austin makes surprise visit to Kyiv to reemphasize support for Ukraine," US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Kyiv on Monday, in a surprise trip to Ukraine to reemphasize the US’ support for the embattled country amid other pressing challenges abroad. “The message that I bring you today, Mr. President, is the United States of America is with you,” Austin told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “We will remain with you for the long-haul. What happened here in Ukraine – that not only matters to Ukraine but it matters to the rest of the world. It certainly matters to the United States of America.” According to a Defense Department news release, Austin traveled to Ukraine to “reinforce the staunch support of the United States for Ukraine’s fight for freedom.” During Austin’s visit, the Defense Department announced a new security package for Ukraine totaling $100 million — one of the smallest packages yet as available funding for US assistance begins to run low. The package — which is the 51st to be provided from DOD inventories — includes one High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and additional ammunition; 155mm artillery rounds; stinger anti-aircraft missiles; and Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles. It also includes cold weather gear, demolition munitions to clear obstacles, and more than three million rounds of small arms ammunition. As he announced the package, Austin said he sees “bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress.” “I know there are things we need to continue to work through to get the supplemental request approved. And we’ll continue to work with Congress to do that. And Congress, our congressional members, have valid questions that we will answer,” he said. Senior defense officials, in a briefing with traveling press, emphasized the critical nature of Austin’s visit and the message it sends that the US will continue to support Ukraine despite other challenges, specifically in the Middle East with Israel’s fight against Hamas. While US funding for aid to Ukraine is dwindling, the official said a “number of capabilities” that were procured over the last year and a half will begin coming online in the next few months and “throughout 2024.” “So, there will be a steady supply of capabilities immediately and for some time,” the official said. The official also said they anticipated Russia targeting critical infrastructure in the winter months as they did last year. “They did it last winter. We’ve already seen some of those strikes actually in the last couple of days. But we are on track to provide a steady stream of artillery, ammunition, longer-range fire throughout these months so there’s that,” the official said. “We can do both at the same time.” Upon his arrival in Kyiv, Austin met with roughly 25 Americans in Ukraine as part of the Defense Department’s Embassy Kyiv team. In remarks before their meeting, Austin thanked them for their work and assured them what they’re doing matters. “When you’re working hard each and every day and things are going not quite like you want them to go every day, you sometimes question whether or not what you’re doing at that time is really making a difference. It is,” Austin said. “You are enabling us to provide support to a country that’s fighting for its existence. There’s probably nothing more important than that.” Austin’s trip comes just days before he will host the 17th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, virtually from the Pentagon.

Biden’s birthday prompts debate about age and wisdom of America’s oldest president," President Joe Biden is marking his 81st birthday milestone Monday with a low-key family celebration as he braces for a strenuous election year ahead. But even as the first family keeps the celebrations muted and out-of-sight, the moment nevertheless highlights his greatest campaign liability – his advanced age and, along with it, perceptions among voters that his physical and mental fitness have declined. On Monday morning, as he presided over the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, Biden seemingly confused pop stars Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. Being the national Thanksgiving turkey, he said, is “harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance tour or Britney’s tour she on -– it’s kind of warm in Brazil right now,” appearing to confuse Spears with Swift, who is currently on the South America leg of her Eras tour. He also offered multiple jokes about his age. “I just want you to know it’s difficult turning 60 – difficult,” he told the turkey pardon audience, laughing. And as he noted the 76th anniversary of the event, he joked that he “wasn’t there” at the first edition. Later, a picture on Biden’s Instagram feed showed him posing with a birthday cake ablaze with candles. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the president said in the post. Officials at the White House and the campaign privately acknowledge age is a vulnerability, and they work both to eliminate potential gaffes and project vigor. Biden was prescribed custom orthotics to help with his feet this year, after his annual physical determined that he experiences a “stiff gait.” In recent months, when Biden flies on Air Force One, he has started using a smaller, shorter set of stairs more frequently to board and deplane. Biden has also made an effort to pass reporters on bike rides during vacations in Delaware, occasionally stopping to take questions while clad in his helmet. (The president is an avid user of Peloton at the White House.) Still, the age liability comes into sharper focus almost by the day. A spate of recent polling, including a new CNN poll, indicates it’s a chronic issue with voters. And critics raise it every chance they get. On Saturday, former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, called Biden “a stupid person” who “can’t get off this stage … by the time whatever it is he’s taking wears off,” prompting cheers from a crowd in Fort Dodge, Iowa. On Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 45, remarked that “Father Time is undefeated,” naming age as an issue for both Biden and Trump, 77, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. Biden already is the oldest president in history, ahead of Ronald Reagan, who was 77 at the end of his second term. If elected in 2024, Biden would be 86 at the end of his second term. Trump, who would be approaching 83 at the same point, would take the baton for oldest president in history if elected. Biden advisers argue – and grumble – that there’s a double standard, with media coverage more focused on Biden’s age than Trump’s. Still, they insist that voters are focused on other issues and that age won’t be a deciding factor next November. “I don’t think the campaign should be focused on anything but the winning record,” said Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, a member of the Biden campaign’s national advisory board. “Everything else about people’s biographies or when their birthdays are – that doesn’t matter. People want to know, what did they do, and what are they going to do?” On Monday, Biden’s birthday milestone will pass with little fanfare. His day is set to include the time-honored pre-Thanksgiving tradition of the annual turkey pardon. He is also expected to receive briefings from his national security advisers on global crises. The campaign isn’t ignoring Biden’s birthday, aides told CNN. A Democratic National Committee official tells CNN there are plans to commemorate the occasion with a post to social media, as the party has done every year since 2011, except in the three years when he was a candidate or prospective candidate. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is also urging supporters to sign a virtual birthday card for the president. The former president, who has openly criticized Biden on just about everything, has shown unusual restraint when it comes to directly attacking the president’s age. It’s a topic of sensitivity for both men, and Trump seems aware of the perils of contrasting himself with Biden over their exact age difference – which is three years and five months. In a recent interview, Trump avoided attacking Biden’s age directly. “He’s not too old, he’s incompetent,” Trump told Megyn Kelly in an interview on her eponymous Sirius XM show last month. “Age is interesting because some people are very sharp and some people do lose it, but you lose it at 40 and 50 also,” he went on. “But no, he’s not too old at all. He’s grossly incompetent.” In turn, the Biden campaign has begun to signal it’s not afraid to go there, too. “Is Donald Trump okay?” an official Biden campaign account said in a post to social media platform X earlier this month. It featured a mash-up video of Trump gaffes, including confusing the city he was in, calling former President Barack Obama his “leading political opponent” and mixing up the home country of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. For his own part, Biden sometimes laughs off his age. “I don’t look it, but I’m 180 years old. I’ve been around a long time,” he joked to donors at a recent fundraiser. But mostly, he and other officials frame his age as a source of wisdom and experience. “I have more experience than any president has in the history of the United States,” he said at another fundraiser. “One of the things that comes with age, hopefully, is wisdom.” John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications,  suggested that Biden’s experience – particularly in the foreign policy realm – is a positive. “I’ve never seen the world more turbulent, and at a time like this, when things are as turbulent and uncertain and in some cases – frightening – as they are right now, you want somebody at the helm who has seen the world, who has developed the relationships with world leaders, who has experienced problems akin to these over and over and over again, and who understands the history behind where we are today,” Kirby told CNN. Biden “brings to the foreign policy helm a steady hand and wisdom and experience,” Kirby said. “That is irreplaceable.” White House aides also point to the president’s capacity to participate in strenuous trips and high-stakes meetings with world leaders as evidence of his stamina. He often leaves his colleagues exhausted, they say. Kirby pointed to instances of Biden pressing his colleagues to add events or engagements to jam-packed schedules. He added a call with the Emir of Qatar Friday morning ahead of meetings at the APEC summit in California. He also added an impromptu gaggle with reporters on Air Force One following a grueling trip to Tel Aviv, Israel, last month. Polls show the question persists. In an August AP-NORC Poll, 77% of respondents agreed with the assessment that Biden is too old to effectively serve another four-year term as president, while 51% of respondents said the same of Trump. In a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month, just 25% of registered voters say Biden has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president, while 53% feel Trump does. And in the newer CNN poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, 56% of likely Democratic voters in the Granite State mentioned the president’s age when asked to name their biggest concern about Biden as a candidate. When New Hampshire adults more broadly were polled on a list of the candidates’ personal attributes, Trump fared worse on each (temperament, honesty and integrity, policy positions, decision-making abilities) than Biden – except physical and mental fitness. A majority of voters – 58% – offered a poor assessment of Biden’s physical and mental fitness, compared with 53% who gave Trump poor marks. Still, those numbers reflect clear concerns from voters on the issue for both candidates. There is, of course, the possibility that Biden could square off with a different opponent in the general election. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is in second place in the New Hampshire GOP primary poll, has proposed “mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.” The president’s age is often one of the first topics to come up in conversations with young voters – often as a subject of questions about whether he’s up to the job. “I don’t want to say it’s his age alone that could be a deterrent for young voters,” said Kerry Singleton, a senior at Morehouse College in Atlanta. “I will say it’s the delivery on the promises that were given to a lot of the young voters.” Rachael Carroll, who graduated last year from Clark Atlanta University, said she believes Biden is from another era, where he doesn’t understand the progressive views of many Democratic voters. “No offense, but yes, it’s a little old to me,” Carroll said, adding that Trump’s age should be of equal concern to Americans. “They don’t understand what we’re going through now because we’re living in two completely different times.” Nabilah Islam Parkes, who last fall became the youngest woman elected to the Georgia state Senate, said she doesn’t believe age is the overriding concern about Biden. She said questions about the administration’s handling of the Middle East – and his worldview – are far more pressing. “As long as we feel like he reflects our values,” she said, “age shouldn’t be an issue.” And progressive groups working to mobilize young voters said that they do not think Biden’s age will ultimately be a significant factor in whether young voters show up for him at the polls. “It’s so low on the list of things we think about it and things that are actually impacting our lives,” said Jack Lobel, national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow, an organization that focuses on Gen Z voters. “It’s not a primary concern.” CNN’s Jeff Zeleny, Camila DeChalus, Kristen Holmes, and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",US Politics
"Utah man charged with threatening pro-Palestinian group in Washington, DC"," A Utah man was arrested after allegedly making threats against a pro-Palestinian group in the US, the Justice Department announced Monday. Court records say Kevin Buchanan of Tooele, Utah, called a Palestinian rights group in Washington, DC, and left multiple threatening voicemails, saying: “We know who you are, who your families are” and “You’re gonna die.” Buchanan has been charged with transmitting interstate threats and could face a maximum of five years in prison if convicted. No attorney is listed on his public court docket. “This is a war against Islam,” Buchanan allegedly said in one of the numerous, lengthy voicemails. “Palestinians are going to die. By the hundreds of thousands.” Officials at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have warned of the increase in threats against Muslims and Jewish people in the US amid the war between Israel and Hamas, which erupted after the militant group’s deadly October 7 attacks and Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza. According to court documents, agents tracked the phone number associated with the threats and found it was associated with a non-contract cell phone purchased at a Walmart in Utah with a credit card belonging to Buchanan. Authorities arrested Buchanan on Friday. The nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group this month said the US is experiencing an “appalling” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month since the October 7 attacks. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has recorded a 216% increase in requests for help and reported bias incidents compared with the previous year, and Muslim and Arab Americans tell CNN the surge has forced them to become more vigilant. A week after Hamas’ attack, authorities said a Chicago-area landlord stabbed and killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and seriously injured his mother, allegedly because the tenants are Muslim. The landlord has pleaded not guilty to charges including murder and hate crimes. And earlier this month, a man was charged for a hate crime for allegedly ripping the hijab off a Muslim postal worker before attacking her.

Appeals court strikes down key tool used to enforce Voting Rights Act," A federal appeals court on Monday ruled against a key tool used to enforce the Voting Rights Act – likely setting up another Supreme Court showdown over one of the nation’s landmark civil rights laws. In a ruling that springs from an Arkansas redistricting case, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that private entities cannot bring lawsuits under a provision of the law, known as Section 2. If it stands, the decision would dramatically weaken what remains of the Voting Rights Act, passed in 1965 to counter racial discrimination in elections. In a 2-1 decision, the judges said the “text and structure” of the voting rights statute shows that Congress did not give private plaintiffs the authority to sue. The appellate panel affirmed a 2022 ruling by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Arkansas that held only the US Justice Department can bring Section 2 lawsuits. That ruling runs counter to decades of legal practice, however. The vast majority of cases brought under the Voting Rights Act – which prohibits election rules that have the intent or effect of discriminating on the basis of race – are brought by private plaintiffs, with the Justice Department facing strained resources and other considerations that limit the number of such cases it files to, at most, a few each year. “Eliminating individual people’s right to sue under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act runs contrary to settled law, common sense and any basic concept of fairness: when the government discriminates against people, they should have a right to fight back in court,” Paul Smith, senior vice president of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement. The center had submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, arguing that private lawsuits are critical to enforcing the Voting Rights Act. The US Justice Department’s voting section – which enforces federal voting laws – simply does have not enough lawyers “to be everywhere in the nation at once,” said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. He worked as an attorney in the DOJ’s voting section during the Clinton and Bush administrations. “That’s why over the course of over 50 years, private plaintiffs have also brought those cases so that residents of a small county in Arkansas are just as well protected as residents of the entirety of the state of California,” he added. The case at hand centers on a challenge originally brought by the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel to Arkansas’ state House map. The ruling immediately affects the seven states covered by the 8th Circuit: Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. And it comes as the 2024 presidential campaign heats up. Voting procedures around the country have been the subject of intense political battles ever since the 2020 presidential election. Former President Donald Trump has falsely and continuously claimed that election fraud contributed to his loss. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, a Republican, hailed Monday’s ruling as helping to curb “meritless” challenges to states’ decisions on how to draw legislative maps and conduct elections. “For far too long, courts across the country have allowed political activists to file meritless lawsuits seeking to seize control of how states conduct elections and redistricting,” he said in a statement. “This decision confirms that enforcement of the Voting Rights Act should be handled by politically accountable officials and not by outside special interest groups.” Circuit Judge David Stras, a Trump appointee writing for the majority, said the text of the Voting Rights Act does not spell out a “private right of action” or the ability of a private citizen to sue. In his dissent, Chief Circuit Judge Lavenski Smith – a George W. Bush appointee – noted that at least 182 successful Section 2 cases have been brought in the past 40 years, only 15 of which were brought solely by the US Justice Department. “Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government’s agents for protection,” Smith wrote. An appeal of Monday’s ruling could go to the full 8th Circuit for review. But the matter ultimately is expected to end up before the nation’s high court, in part because a panel from another appellate court, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, recently came to a different conclusion. Just this year, in a high-profile Alabama redistricting case, the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the use of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in ordering the state to redraw its congressional map to guarantee more political power for Black voters. The decision surprised many legal observers, given that the high court in 2013 weakened the law by defanging a separate provision of the law that determined which states needed approval from the US Department of Justice or a federal court before they could make changes to their voting procedures and laws.

Trump co-defendant says Georgia prosecutors are retaliating against him for rejecting a plea deal," Harrison Floyd, one of Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the election subversion case in Georgia, claimed in a court filing Monday that prosecutors are seeking to revoke his bond as retaliation after he rejected a plea deal. Prosecutors say Floyd, the leader of Black Voices for Trump, made social media posts against witnesses in the case that “demonstrate that he poses a significant threat of intimidating witnesses.” A hearing on the motion to revoke Floyd’s bond agreement and potentially send him to jail is set for Tuesday afternoon before Judge Scott McAfee. Floyd’s attorneys, in a filing Monday, argued that his social media posts did not violate the conditions of his bond and accused prosecutors of a “retaliatory measure because he rejected the State’s plea offer,” and took other steps, such as subpoenaing Fulton County election records. CNN has reached out to the Fulton County district attorney’s office for comment. Floyd’s lawyers also argued in the filing that prosecutors were retaliating because he “exercised his First Amendment rights after the State intimated that Mr. Floyd was the ‘leaker’” – a reference to a lawyer for another co-defendant leaking key video evidence to the media. In a social media post last week, Floyd questioned why his team was accused of leaking the videos even though his own lawyer seemed to admit to the leak in an email chain with prosecutors before saying it was a “typo.” In his post, Floyd criticized Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman, who is a witness in the case. Prosecutors say the post was among more than a dozen public statements that they say violate the terms of his bond agreement. Floyd’s attorneys also accused prosecutors of a double standard, pointing out that Trump’s bond order in the same case “specifically mentions social media.” “A review of President Trump’s social media posts make the State’s decision to go after Harrison Floyd hard to justify,” Floyd’s attorneys wrote, citing several posts from Trump about Sidney Powell, an attorney who recently pleaded guilty in the case, as well as Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff and current co-defendant. The filing from Floyd comes the same day Trump’s lawyers argued in a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, to strike down a gag order in the election subversion case there. Floyd’s attorneys argue their client’s social media posts do not contain any threats and not are an attempt to intimidate anyone, adding that his posts “constitute political speech” guaranteed by the First Amendment.

Trump releases doctor’s note saying he is in ‘excellent’ health," Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Monday released a note from his doctor, saying that he is in “excellent” health and that his cognitive exams “were exceptional.” The letter is written by Dr. Bruce Aronwald, who describes himself as “Trump’s personal physician since 2021,” and comes after Trump, 77, has made verbal slips that brought his age to the forefront. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday the presidency is “not a job for somebody that is pushing 80” as he sought to contrast his youth relative to Trump and President Joe Biden, who turned 81 on Monday. Aronwald writes that the former president’s most recent “comprehensive examination” was September 13, 2023, and that his “cardiovascular studies are all normal and cancer screening tests” were negative, and that Trump had “reduced his weight.” The letter, however, makes broad statements about Trump’s health but does not include information about the types of tests that Trump took or what the results were. It doesn’t include even basic information that Trump’s physicians have shared in the past, such as his height and weight, cholesterol level or blood pressure. In 2015, Trump’s then-campaign released a similar letter written by Dr. Harold Bornstein. “His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,” the 2015 letter stated. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein later said that Trump dictated the letter to him. During his tenure in the White House, Trump received a glowing bill of health by Dr. Ronny Jackson, the then-presidential physician. Jackson, now a congressman and one of Trump’s staunchest supporters, gushed about the then-president’s health during a briefing to the White House press corps in January 2018, touting Trump’s “good genes,” how he did “exceedingly well” on his cognitive test and his “excellent” cardiac health.

Voting Rights Act ruling is latest attempt by Trump-nominated judges to overturn Supreme Court precedent," A US appellate court decision Monday undercutting the Voting Rights Act of 1965 rejects decades of precedent and appears likely to provoke a confrontation at the US Supreme Court, where the milestone law has been increasingly under attack. At stake are the voting rights of Blacks, Hispanics and other racial minorities that have been vindicated under a section of the VRA prohibiting discrimination based on race. Section 2 has helped ensure that states draw legislative and congressional districts fairly and that minority voters have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The Supreme Court – as recently as June – has reaffirmed Section 2. But US appellate judge David Stras, the author of the majority opinion in Monday’s case from Arkansas, observed that Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have called a key provision of the law into question. His ruling Monday could ultimately gut the law’s protections. Monday’s appellate court ruling – essentially getting out ahead of the high court – seems certain to instigate a new voting-rights showdown as the nation heads into a presidential election cycle. The decision is the latest example of former President Donald Trump’s influence over the federal judiciary. Stras, one of Trump’s first appellate court appointees, defied Supreme Court precedent to bolster a conservative interpretation of the law backed by Thomas and Gorsuch, who was Trump’s first Supreme Court appointee. In Monday’s groundbreaking decision, the 2-to-1 panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that private plaintiffs, such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund or American Civil Liberties Union, have no right to bring litigation on behalf of voters under Section 2. Stras was joined in the majority by Circuit Judge Raymond Gruender, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. Citing Thomas and Gorsuch, Stras said it has been an “open question” as to how far the law goes. Yet that notion has never drawn as Supreme Court majority. “For much of the last half-century,” Stras, a former Thomas law clerk, acknowledged, “courts have assumed that Section 2 is privately enforceable.” But, he added, “A deeper look has revealed that this assumption rests on flimsy footing…” The decision swept back the history of the legislation and longstanding court interpretations, saying Congress had failed to explicitly detail that private parties could challenge VRA violations. Only the US attorney general has that explicit right, the ruling said. The dissenting judge countered that a foundational principle of American law is that “where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy.” Judge Lavenski Smith, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, added that Congress never intended enforcement of the law – “so foundational to self-government” – to be left only to the federal government. The justices on the contemporary court have been deeply divided over the reach of the act passed at the height of the Civil Rights movement and only after the March 1965 “Bloody Sunday” attacks on marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama. The high court, dominated by conservative jurists, has over the past decade curtailed federal voting protections, giving states more latitude for redistricting and other electoral practices. But last June, a 5-4 majority reinforced the act’s protections against discriminatory voting lines by invalidating an Alabama map found to have diluted Black voting power. The Alabama legislature had packed much of the state’s African American population into one district and divided the rest among other districts. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote for the slim cross-ideological majority, said Alabama’s arguments flew in the face of precedent. “The heart of these cases,” he wrote, “is not about the law as it exists. It is about Alabama’s attempt to remake our Section 2 jurisprudence anew.” Thomas, one of the dissenters in that case of Allen v. Milligan, specifically noted at the time: “The Court does not address whether Section 2 contains a private right of action.” Only Gorsuch joined that portion of Thomas’ dissenting opinion, which echoed a point Gorsuch made two years earlier that Thomas signed on to. Ruling against the Arkansas State Conference NAACP, which had contended the state diminished Black voting power in redistricting, Stras said neither the text nor structure of the VRA gives private plaintiffs a clear right to sue under Section 2. “If the 1965 Congress clearly intended to create a private right of action, then why not say so in the statute?” he wrote. Referring to other voting-rights advocates that had joined the state NAACP, he added, “The advocacy groups argue that courts have been adjudicating Section 2 claims brought by private plaintiffs for years, so they must be available. But assuming their existence, and even discussing them, is different from actually deciding that a private right of action exists.” That contradicts longstanding Supreme Court and lower federal court interpretations of the law, Chief Judge Smith wrote in his dissent. “Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government’s agents for protection,” Smith said, citing research showing that “over the past forty years, there have been at least 182 successful Section 2 cases; only 15 were brought solely by the Attorney General.” Smith contended the 8th Circuit majority should have left resolution of whether Section 2 can be invoked by private plaintiffs to the justices – rather than trying to “predict the Supreme Court’s future decisions.”",US Politics
US imposes visa restrictions on two Russian military officials for human rights violations in Ukraine," The United States imposed visa sanctions on two Russian military officials due to their “involvement in gross violations of human rights” in Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday. Russian Armed Forces Col. Azatbek Omurbekov, also known as “The Butcher of Bucha,” and Guard Corporal Daniil Frolkin were sanctioned for involvement in the extrajudicial killings of civilians from Andriivka, Ukraine, Blinken said in a statement. “As a result of today’s action, Omurbekov, Frolkin, and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States,” the top US diplomat said. Omurbekov was the commanding officer of Russia’s 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade when it controlled Andriivka, and he “led the brigade to Bucha, Ukraine, where the Department of State determined that the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade killed, beat, dismembered, burned, and conducted mock executions of civilians,” according to the statement. The State Department sanctioned the entire unit in June 2022 for human rights violations. In December, CNN interviewed a former soldier in the brigade who deserted in September 2022 and fled to Europe. “There are maniacs who enjoy killing a man. Such maniacs turned up there,” he said. Blinken said in his statement Monday that “the reports that Omurbekov and Frolkin were involved in gross violations of human rights, as documented by NGOs and independent investigations, are serious and credible.” “By publicly designating Omurbekov and Frolkin, the United States reaffirms its commitment to upholding human rights, acknowledging the injustice experienced by victims and survivors, and promoting accountability for those responsible for human rights violations,” he said. The announcement of the new visa sanctions comes on the same day that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made a surprise trip to Ukraine to emphasize continued US support to the nation. Senior defense officials, in a briefing with traveling press, emphasized the critical nature of Austin’s visit and the message it sends that the US will continue to support Ukraine despite other challenges, specifically in the Middle East with Israel’s fight against Hamas. As part of his trip, Austin announced an additional $100 million in security assistance for Ukraine. He stressed the need for Congress to pass President Joe Biden’s supplemental funding request, which would provide assistance for both Ukraine and Israel.

Takeaways from the tense appeals court hearing over the Trump gag order in federal election subversion case," A federal appeals panel appears inclined to restore the limited gag order in former President Donald Trump’s federal election subversion case, but may loosen some restrictions so he can more directly criticize special counsel Jack Smith. A three-judge panel of the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Monday in the closely watched case, which stems from Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and obstruct the lawful transfer of power. He pleaded not guilty. None of the three judges embraced Trump’s claims that the gag order should be wiped away for good because it is a “categorically unprecedented” violation of his free speech rights. Yet they also posed sharp questions to prosecutors as they tried to find the boundary of where intense campaign trail rhetoric crosses the line of undermining a criminal case. “We certainly want to make sure that the criminal trial process and its integrity and its truth-finding function are protected, but we ought to use a careful scalpel here and not step into really sort of skewing the political arena,” Circuit Judge Patricia Millett said. The limited gag order from District Judge Tanya Chutkan – which was temporarily frozen by the appeals panel when they agreed to hear the case – restricts Trump’s ability to directly attack Smith, members of his team, court staff or potential trial witnesses. He is allowed to criticize the Justice Department, proclaim his innocence and argue that the case is “politically motivated.” The appellate judges, who are all Democratic appointees, heard the case on an expedited schedule and are expected to issue a ruling soon, but the timing is unclear. Here are key takeaways from the hearing: Millett repeatedly challenged Trump attorney D. John Sauer, saying it was important to draw a distinction between purely political campaign rhetoric and speech intended to subvert the legal process. “First of all, we’re not shutting down everyone who speaks,” Millett said. “This is only affecting the speech temporarily during a criminal trial process by someone who has been indicted as a felon. … No one here is threatening the First Amendment broadly.” Sauer argued that the restrictions on all criminal defendants against illegal speech like blatant witness tampering were more than enough to protect the integrity of the case. He said the gag order infringed on Trump’s “core political speech.” Cutting him off, Millett said: “Labeling it ‘core political speech’ begs the question of whether it is in fact political speech or whether it is political speech aimed at derailing or corrupting the criminal justice process. You can’t simply label it that and conclude your balancing tests that way. We have to balance.” Sauer responded by arguing that the speech potentially being restricted by the gag order is “inextricably entwined with the issues that are being publicly debated in the context of the campaign.” Later in the hearing, Millett and fellow DC Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard both signaled that they think the existing gag order could be loosened to allow Trump to levy additional public attacks against Smith and his team of prosecutors. Not that they think the attacks are well-founded, but that Trump should have the right to defend himself. “It can’t be that he can’t mention Mr. Smith,” because most Americans have heard about the case in the context that it was initiated by Smith’s team. That has become the shorthand, Pillard noted. “Surely he has a thick enough skin,” Pillard said of the special counsel. Trump can’t be forced under a gag order to “speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets” at him during a theoretical GOP presidential primary debate, Millet added. The names of Smith and the other prosecutors are all “part of the public record,” she said. The current gag order prevents Trump from “making any public statements … that target the special counsel… or his staff.” In speeches and social media posts, Trump often says Smith is “deranged” and a “lunatic.” Trump has criticized Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, at nearly every turn. Earlier this month, he called the special counsel a “disgrace to America.” Millett posed sharp questions about the potential of Trump to intimidate witnesses while he is campaigning for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination that hit on a well-documented pattern of Trump trying to threaten, discredit or cajole witnesses through public rhetoric. She raised the hypothetical of Trump saying at a rally that a specific person is being “bothered” by prosecutors and that he thinks people who are “faithful” and “loyal” shouldn’t cooperate with prosecutors. In response, Sauer claimed Trump hasn’t done that in this case. Millet asked if it would acceptable for Trump to post: “Mike Pence can still do the right thing if he says the right stuff tomorrow,” on the eve of his testimony at the trial. (The witness list hasn’t been announced yet, but Pence is clearly a major part of the case.) Sauer said this type of speech could only be restricted if there was a “compelling evidentiary showing” of “an actual threat” against Pence. A significant portion of Smith’s case against Trump revolves around Trump’s efforts to pressure Pence to abuse his position overseeing the Electoral College certification to block the lawful transfer of power after the 2020 election. “The district court correctly found that the defendant’s well-established practice of using his public platform to target his adversaries, including trial participants in this case, poses a significant and immediate risk to the fairness and integrity of these proceedings,” special counsel prosecutor Cecil VanDevender argued. At several different points, Millett expressed concern about Trump potentially revealing the personal information of jurors in his trial and how his speech might lead some of his followers to similarly attack jurors on the Internet. The potential issue of online threats being directed toward jurors as a result of Trump’s speech could factor into the judges’ final decision on the gag order. Prosecutors have argued that those kinds of threats could prejudice the jury in the case. “If the district court entered an order restricting a criminal defendant from making comments about individual jurors, and the defendant were a candidate for public office, would that order violate the First Amendment?” Millett asked Sauer. “It would depend on the context, but I do concede there would be facts that could justify an order like that,” Sauer said, prompting the judge to appear somewhat puzzled by his response. “It would depend on the context?” she asked. Millett returned to her concerns later in the hearing, this time pressing the special counsel’s office if it was possible to proactively protect jurors from online doxxing by Trump “loyalists” acting in response to the former president’s speech. “Is there any way, preventatively, to protect someone’s technology? Like let’s say I’m a prospective juror, can I be protected technologically from like doxxing?” she said. “Because we do have – as you appreciate – the problem of speech by the defendant, and then it has the knock-on effect with the loyalists’ zeal, and that’s then, you know, what causes direct efforts at threatening and harassing individuals,” the judge explained. Assistant special counsel Cecil VanDevender said he wasn’t aware of any technological tools that would work to mitigate the issue “at the source.” “If they exist, I think they are not widely used and not easy to incorporate, particularly for every witness and every potential juror,” he added. A death threat issued against Chutkan in August by a Texas woman loomed large over the hearing, with two judges bringing up the incident as Sauer, Trump’s attorney, was pressed on whether his client’s speech can lead to real world actions by his supporters. “What the district court is finding is we have a past pattern: When the defendant speaks on this subject, threats follow,” said Circuit Judge Brad Garcia. “Why isn’t the district court justified in taking a proactive measure? Not waiting for more and more threats to actually occur and stepping in to protect the integrity of the trial?” Sauer countered that there is “an evidentiary burden here,” and argued that despite Trump’s online comments on the case, prosecutors “haven’t come forward with a single threat that’s even arguably inspired by any of his social media posts.” But Garcia and Millett quickly pushed back, with them both bringing up Abigail Jo Shry, who was charged in August after making the threat against Chutkan. “The day after (Trump) said, ‘If you come after me, I’m coming after you,’ that threat issued,” Millett said. Shortly after Smith unveiled the federal charges against Trump, Shry called Chutkan’s chambers and left a voicemail message threatening to “kill anyone who went after former President Trump,” according to a criminal complaint. The death threats also allegedly included racist comments against Chutkan, who is Black. Prosecutors said in court filings that Shry called the judge a “stupid slave n***er” in the voicemail. Sauer attempted to distance Shry from Trump’s comments, saying that in her case, “there’s no evidence of any reading of social media.” “That particular threatener is a – unemployed, you know, mentally unstable, heavy alcoholic who sits on her couch drinking beer all day, according to her father. Never leaves the apartment, watches the news, not reads things on social media, watches the news on TV, gets angry about it and makes angry, threatening calls,” he said.",US Politics
Commission on Presidential Debates announces dates and locations for 2024 general election debates," The first presidential debate is set for mid-September 2024, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Monday, setting up the earliest ever start to the presidential debate schedule. The bipartisan commission, which has sponsored every general election presidential debate since its founding in 1987, will host three next year, with the first on September 16 at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. The second debate will be on October 1 at Virginia State University in Petersburg, Virginia, and the third will be on October 9 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. There will also be one vice presidential debate on September 25 at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Typically, the first debate has been in late September or early October. In 2020, the first debate was on September 29, but amid an uptick in pandemic-era early voting, the Trump campaign called for an additional early September debate. The schedule tweak also means that the debates will end earlier than they ever have. There will be 27 days between the last debate and Election Day on November 5. That’s compared to 12 days in 2020 and 20 days in 2016. However, it’s not certain the debates will actually happen. Last year, the Republican National Committee voted to withdraw from its participation in the commission, with RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel saying at the time that commission is “biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms.” The scheduling change could make it more likely that the eventual Republican nominee participates in the debates, as the lack of a debate before voting started was one of McDaniel’s specific criticisms. In 2020, the second scheduled presidential debate was canceled after then-President Donald Trump refused to take part in the event when the commission proposed doing it virtually because of coronavirus concerns. Instead, Trump and then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden participated in dueling town halls. While the University of Utah hosted the 2020 vice presidential debate, the other three schools will host debates for the first time, with the commission’s co-chairs noting that Virginia State University will be the first historically Black college or university to host a general election debate. All of the debates will start at 9 p.m. ET and will run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks, according to the commission’s statement, but details about format and moderators will be announced next year. To receive an invitation to the debate, candidates need to be constitutionally eligible to serve as president, to be on the ballot on enough states to win a majority of the electoral votes, and to register at least 15% in polls from organizations selected by the commission.",US Politics
Fact check: Trump keeps saying he’s been indicted more than Al Capone. It’s not true," Former President Donald Trump has claimed in speech after speech this fall that he has been indicted three more times than the infamous gangster Al Capone. It’s not true. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has deployed the claim about Capone while trying to portray himself as the victim of unfounded and politically motivated prosecutions. In a speech in Iowa on Saturday, he said, “And by the way, I’ve been indicted more times than Alphonse Capone. He’s the most vicious of all gangsters. If he took you to dinner and if you didn’t look proper, if you laughed a little bit, he might think you’re laughing at him, it’s dangerous to laugh – he’d kill you immediately. He was indicted one time. I was indicted four times.” He similarly said in an October speech in Florida: “If you looked at him wrong, he’d kill you, and he’d kill you with his hands. He was a tough guy. He got indicted one time. I got indicted four times.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that Capone was indicted only one time is false. Capone was indicted at least six times, as A. Brad Schwartz, the co-author of a book on Capone, told CNN. And that doesn’t include various criminal charges against Capone that did not involve an indictment, such as some misdemeanors, or obscure Capone cases for which CNN couldn’t immediately determine whether there was an indictment. Capone’s indictment list It’s obviously impossible to directly compare the indictments faced by an early 20th-century gangster and a 21st-century president of the United States; they were investigated by different people for different things under different laws. But since Trump has made his claim about Capone a centerpiece of his attacks on his own criminal cases, here are the facts. Capone was indicted three times in 1931 alone, the year he was famously convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. Schwartz, co-author of “Scarface and the Untouchable: Al Capone, Eliot Ness, and the Battle for Chicago,” explained that these were: “A secret indictment for tax evasion handed down in March 1931 (before the statute of limitations ran out for charges from the year 1924)”; a larger indictment in June 1931, with more than 20 counts, for tax evasion in the period from 1925 to 1929; “and a bootlegging conspiracy indictment, based on the work of Eliot Ness and his Untouchables, later that same month.” There was more. Before the landmark 1931 conviction, Capone was indicted and convicted in 1929 for carrying concealed weapons in Philadelphia. Schwartz also noted two lesser-known indictments of Capone that did not result in a conviction: a 1926 federal indictment for conspiracy to violate Prohibition laws and a 1933 local indictment for racketeering. And in the 1920s, Capone had other criminal court cases that either didn’t involve an indictment or that CNN couldn’t immediately determine whether an indictment was involved. (Capone used aliases, and some of these century-old records are spotty.) These included a 1921 case related to Capone’s operation of brothels and gambling establishments, a 1922 case for assault with a vehicle and other charges (which was pointed out to CNN by journalist Jonathan Eig, author of another book on Capone), and a 1929 federal contempt of court case on which he was convicted in 1931. Addressing Trump’s false claims about supposedly being indicted more than Capone, Schwartz added: “This isn’t a race, of course, but it may be worth noting that Capone is also way ahead in individual counts (the 1931 Prohibition indictment alone added up to five thousand conspiracy charges).” Trump faces 91 total counts over his two federal indictments and two local indictments. One of Trump’s federal cases regards his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The other is about his post-presidency retention of classified documents. Trump’s case in Fulton County, Georgia is also related to his election subversion efforts. His case in New York is about his alleged falsification of business records related to a hush money scheme.",US Politics
White House eager to promote dropping prices this Thanksgiving season amid campaign headwinds," The White House – and President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign – are eager to promote dropping prices on everything from gas to the cost of turkey this Thanksgiving as they look to convince skeptical Americans that the president’s policies are paying off for their pocketbooks. White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and top economic and communications officials have been keyed in on touting the improved figures ahead of the holidays, two White House officials said, holding meetings on how to communicate the drop in prices to the public. The White House is also putting economic surrogates out on regional television to push the message this coming week, one White House official said. Zients, along with other economic and communication aides, has used social media to promote news reports on prices drops for gas, travel and turkey. “Good news for families. More work to do,“ Zients posted Monday on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, alongside one story. It’s similar to a tactic used by his predecessor, Ron Klain, who would monitor and promote easing gas prices on a regular basis on social media. The holiday push to highlight easing prices comes as the White House and Biden campaign have struggled to move the needle with voters who say they feel economic pain despite some improved economic indicators. A new NBC News poll found only 38% of voters on the national level approve of President Biden’s handling of the economy. A recent New York Times/Sienna College poll conducted last month found 52% of registered voters in key swing states had a poor view of the economy. And the economy is expected to be a prominent issue for voters heading into 2024 with 66% of registered voters on the national level saying the economy will be extremely important to their votes, according to a CNN poll, conducted by SSRS. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that while he and other administration officials are focused on highlighting these positive economic indicators, he also argued that while Americans feel there’s more to be done they “agree” with the path Biden is taking. “That doesn’t mean you can go around saying that everything’s perfect. And we recognize that. American’s have had a rough few years, especially when you think about Covid,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash on “Inside Politics,” adding: “We’re not out there saying that all of the work is done, we’re out there pointing to the good work that we’re doing.” As Americans gather around their Thanksgiving tables this year, the price of the average meal is down from a historic high, signaling some relief from rampant inflation. The average cost of the feast is down approximately 4.5% compared with last year, according to the American Farm Bureau’s annual survey. A Thanksgiving meal of 12 classic items for 10 people will cost $61.17 on average, compared to last year’s record high average of $64.05. Gas prices have also fallen just in time for the Thanksgiving travel rush. The national average price of regular gasoline is down by 55 cents a gallon over the past two months to $3.33, according to AAA. This exceeds the typical seasonal drop in gas prices during the fall and leaves the national average at a 10-month low. US consumer price inflation last month cooled more than expected, after rising for the last two months. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.2% for the 12 months that ended in October, down from 3.7% in September, and clocking in at the lowest annual rate since March 2021, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released last week.

Here are the dozen brands that have paused ads on X amid ongoing crisis for Elon Musk’s platform," At least a dozen major brands have halted ad spending on X, formerly Twitter, since its latest advertiser exodus began last week over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech on Elon Musk’s social media platform. Fox Sports, Ubisoft, Axios, TechCrunch and Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media all told CNN in recent days that they’d paused their ad spending on X, joining other large advertisers that jumped ship last week. The ongoing exit of advertisers marks a deepening crisis for X, which was already struggling to woo brands back to the platform following Musk’s takeover last year. And it comes as growing numbers of X users also decamp to alternate platforms. The White House joined Threads this week, giving a boost to Meta’s X competitor. The latest revolt began last week when IBM said it had suspended advertising on X after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters found its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform. IBM’s decision also came after Musk had publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post on X earlier in the week. On Friday, a slew of major media brands including Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and CNN-parent Warner Bros. Discovery followed suit, although they did not specify their reasons for halting advertising on X. Apple also reportedly pulled its ad spend on X as of last week, according to reports from multiple news outlets. X has called on its advertising partners to help protect what it calls “freedom of speech.” The company on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing Media Matters of misrepresenting how likely it is for ads to run alongside extremist content on the site. X also said it had made the pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters ineligible for monetization, meaning ads can no longer be run on their pages. And CEO Linda Yaccarino has continued to tout brand safety controls that the company says can help prevent ads from running beside objectionable content. (Media Matters has vowed to fight the lawsuit from X and says it stands by its reporting.) But the company has done little else to reassure advertisers that its platform is safe. The pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters remain active on the site, along with other far-right and White supremacist accounts, some of whom Musk had reinstated on the platform following his takeover. CNN on Wednesday observed ads for the University of Michigan running on the page of the X account belonging to Richard Spencer, a known White nationalist. (A University of Michigan spokesperson told CNN the university is “watching developments on X closely as we continue to evaluate our use of the platform.”) Musk this week also boosted the years-old, debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that in 2016 prompted a gun-wielding man to fire shots inside a Washington, D.C., pizza shop. Some advertisers have remained on X despite the hate speech concerns. The National Football League — one of the platform’s biggest ad partners — told CNN Tuesday that it had repeatedly expressed concerns about hate speech to X leadership directly, although it has not pulled its spending from the platform. –CNN’s Oliver Darcy, Liam Reilly and Brian Fung contributed to this report.",Business
OpenAI’s wild week. How the Sam Altman story unfolded," In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week’s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world’s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup’s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he’s back as the company’s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you’re just catching up, here’s what you missed from a week so incredible you’d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI’s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI’s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman’s ouster just minutes before the board’s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what’s next later.” Brockman promptly quit. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.” A key factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI’s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI’s headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman’s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon’s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI’s chief technology officer. In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman’s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company’s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i’m so excited. one team, one mission.” The drama was far from over. The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. “Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.” Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s CEO, the company said on X. “We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft. It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.” Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”",Business
OpenAI had a confusing week. Who came out on top? And who lost out?," The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future. In some ways, the outcome was a return to the status quo: Sam Altman would be restored as CEO, with the company’s deep and lucrative business partnership with Microsoft, which took a $13 billion stake in the company even as it ramps up its own AI research efforts,  left intact. But in other ways, the agreement is still a watershed moment for OpenAI and the artificial intelligence field writ large. The tumultuous week seems to have resulted in a big victory for Altman personally; proponents of widespread AI adoption; and some of the country’s most established elites. And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks. Sam Altman: A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe. Microsoft: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI. But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed. “One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.” Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross… if it happens.” New board members: In naming ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to OpenAI’s board, the agreement stands to align the company even more closely with the country’s wealthiest and most influential elite. Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering. Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized. The push to slow AI development: OpenAI’s ousted board members: In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: A belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI. In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated. OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor. And after having wowed US lawmakers by calling for AI regulation, Altman will likely continue to be a prominent figure in the global debate over rules for artificial intelligence. Still, deserved or not, the dispute appears to have done long-term damage to the credibility of certain deep skeptics of AI, and lifted the fortunes of the Microsofts and Altmans of the world who are pushing to get artificial intelligence into the hands of the public. And that may have untold ripple effects for AI development for years to come.",Business
"Spotify to slash royalties for rain sounds, white noise and other non-music tracks"," Spotify’s new royalty system means so-called functional noises like the sound of rainfall will earn significantly less than traditional music files. In an attempt to crack down on “bad actors” using the genre to fraudulently generate revenue, Spotify announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be increasing the minimum track length for functional noise recordings to two minutes, as well as valuing streams of the sounds at a “fraction of the value” of music track streams. A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry. Until now, creators of functional sounds have been able to game Spotify’s streaming system to maximize revenue with minimal effort. Since streaming royalties are paid out partly based on the amount of times a track is played and sounds like white noise are often listened to for hours, Spotify says creators are shortening sounds to as little as 30 seconds (the platform’s current minimum track length) and looping playlists so that the same clip gets listened to over and over again, bumping up streaming numbers and royalty cash outs. While Spotify did not state how much the platform would be devaluing the streams, Billboard reported that functional tracks would now be worth one-fifth of their music counterparts. The functional genre includes nature sounds, white noise, sound effects and silence recordings. “It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof,” Robert Kync, Warner Music Group CEO, said in a May earnings call, a sentiment echoed by other music executives. “Obviously white noise is very different from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ but it, currently under this model, is paid the same,” Marina Guz, chief commercial officer at Endel, an AI-driven functional music company partnered with Universal Music Group, told CNN. Guz explained that there has been rising pressure from labels and artists to change the way Spotify makes distinctions between functional noise and music. “There’s been an ongoing conversation this entire year of the value of music and how something like someone just putting up white noise is different than paying for an artist that had spent a year in the studio making the album with all kinds of instruments and people involved,” Guz told CNN. In another attempt to clamp down on malicious behavior, the platform announced Tuesday it is moving to charge labels and distributors by track when “flagrant” artificial streaming is suspected. Artificial streaming is when streams counts are increased fraudulently, such as through bots. The company is also making changes to its royalty system, moving to only compensate tracks that generate more than 1000 streams. Spotify has also come under scrutiny for white noise podcasts, with Bloomberg reporting in 2023 that podcasts featuring only ambient sounds were accounting for three million daily consumption hours and accidentally being boosted by Spotify’s own algorithm, resulting in a $38 million loss in potential annual profits. Creators of such podcasts could reportedly rake in as much as $18,000 a month in ads, Bloomberg found in 2022. Spotify’s changes will roll out early next year.",Business
"The NFL, Washington Post, and Walmart: Here are the major companies still advertising on X despite Elon Musk’s antisemitic endorsement"," Some of the world’s most recognizable brands have opted to continue their advertising partnerships with X despite the surge in hate speech on the platform and owner Elon Musk’s continued peddling of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, including an endorsement last week of an antisemitic post. The NFL, Walmart, State Farm, Wendy’s, Office Depot, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, USAA insurance, Formula 1 and Mondelēz International, the maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz Crackers, are among the most recognizable companies that have maintained their relationship with the embattled social media platform amid a swell of controversy. All of the brands have stated company values that would indicate they oppose hate. But outside the NFL, none of the companies responded to CNN’s requests for comment. Brian McCarthy, the NFL’s chief spokesperson, told CNN in a short statement that the sports league “unequivocally denounces all forms of hate speech and discrimination” and had expressed “concerns directly to X.” The decision from the NFL and other companies to continue linking arms with X stands in contrast to how other major brands have responded to the controversy spurred by Musk, who took ownership of the platform formerly known as Twitter last year. Since Musk’s takeover, the platform has reinstated accounts previously banned for harassment and abuse, eliminated verification of authentic information sources and instituted a paid blue checkmark system that has boosted the visibility of racist accounts. Musk has also embraced and fanned the flames of dangerous conspiracy theories, sued an organization exposing the rise in hate speech on the platform, attacked George Soros — a frequent source of antisemitic abuse — and threatened the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group. In recent days, Apple, Disney, IBM, NBCUniversal, Paramount, Fox Sports, Paris Hilton’s 11:11, Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent company) and others have all suspended their advertising campaigns on X. For its part, X said it has removed the ability for certain pro-Nazi accounts to monetize and implemented brand safety controls meant to prevent their ads from running alongside objectionable content. But those assurances have rung hollow as advertisements have continued to be placed on accounts posting hate speech and conspiracy theories. While Musk maintains that he is not antisemitic, industry experts have said that continuing a relationship with X is unwise and could cause brand damage. “Elon introduced unique risks,” marketing industry veteran Lou Paskalis, the founder and chief executive of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory, told CNN. “If I was still running advertising … I would not recommend returning to this platform until three months after he sold it.” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, said it is “irresponsible” for companies to continue marketing their products on X. “It’s self-destructive for any advertiser to be associated with him,” Sonnenfeld told CNN. “It’s pathological.” Musk last week ignited fierce backlash when he backed an antisemitic post that accused Jewish people of “hatred” against White people. His endorsement of the post came as the progressive watchdog Media Matters issued a report that indicated advertisements for major brands appeared next to neo-Nazi hate speech on X. The one-two punch led to an advertiser exodus Friday that has bled into this week. Instead of apologizing for his conduct and acknowledging advertiser concerns, Musk has lashed out at his critics. On Monday, he filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, which said it stood by its reporting and would fight Musk in court. Legal experts have told CNN that the lawsuit is deeply flawed and could open the billionaire up to embarrassing revelations during the discovery process. “This lawsuit is riddled with legal flaws, and it is highly ironic that a platform that touts itself as a beacon of free speech would file a bogus case like this that flatly contradicts basic First Amendment principles and targets free speech by a critic,” First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous CNN. “And in some ways it’s a dream come true for the people at Media Matters,” Boutrous added, “because it could allow them to use the litigation discovery process to force X to divulge all sorts of embarrassing, damaging private information that it would much rather keep secret.” CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report.",Business
Economist Larry Summers joins the board of OpenAI as ousted CEO Sam Altman returns," Economist Larry Summers, the former Obama and Clinton official, is joining an initial, revamped OpenAI board, as the company welcomes back CEO Sam Altman just days after he was ousted by the previous board. The addition of former Clinton Treasury Secretary Summers — as well as former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chair and the retention of Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo — suggests a major change in the board. Summers brings leadership experience from politics, corporate boards and having served as former president of Harvard University. He currently sits on the board of Block, the company behind Cash App, and the software company Skillsoft. Taylor has lots of experience with tech companies and has two degrees in computer science from Stanford University. He stepped down from his position as co-CEO of Salesforce last year. Prior to Salesforce, Taylor founded and led collaboration platform Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016. Taylor also worked as chief technology officer at Facebook during the company’s IPO. D’Angelo, meanwhile, joined OpenAI’s board in 2018 and remains on it. In high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, he developed music suggestion software along with other students including Mark Zuckerberg. After graduating from the California Institute of Technology, he worked at Facebook as chief technology officer and founded the questions and answers platform Quora in 2009. He was one of the OpenAI board members who voted to oust Altman. However, D’Angelo has praised OpenAI’s unorthodox board structure (non-profit controlled with a for-profit entity within), telling Forbes in January, “my hope is that we can do a lot more good for the world than just become another corporation that gets that big.” Those three directors have significantly more experience than much of the previous board, which abruptly fired Altman late on Friday only to see an employee revolt and wide-ranging repercussions in the tech and business worlds. Days later, OpenAI said it had reached an agreement in principle for Altman to return. The company, which posted the news in the early hours of Tuesday morning, gave few details about what the board structure would ultimately look like, as well as how many members it might eventually include. Nor did the company elaborate on what it meany by calling the three-person board “initial.” Instead, the organization said it was working on what happens from here. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” the company posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “Thank you so much for your patience through this.”",Business
Mortgage rates fall for fourth week but stay above 7%," Mortgage rates fell again in the most recent week, as inflation showed signs of slowing. It’s the fourth consecutive week of tumbling rates after rising for seven straight weeks. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to an average of 7.29% in the shortened week ending November 22, according to data from Freddie Mac released on Wednesday, a day earlier than normal due to the Thanksgiving holiday. That was down from 7.44% the week before. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 6.58%. The average rate rose above 7% in mid-August and since then reached as high as 7.79% at the end of October. “In recent weeks, rates have dropped by half a percent, but potential homebuyers continue to hold out for lower rates and more inventory,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a statement. “This dynamic is reflected in the latest data showing that existing home sales have fallen to a thirteen-year low.” The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. A current buyer’s rate may be different. “In a few short weeks, mortgage rates have largely erased the sharp climb traversed in October,” said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist. Part of the reason rates eased this week was mixed data that continues to keep investors guessing, Hale said. “Construction data showed surprising strength, especially in light of fading builder confidence as mortgage rates neared 8% in October, with both permits and starts ticking higher,” she said. Meanwhile, she added, existing home sales slid to their worst reading since 2010 as home prices rose and mortgage rates pushed the cost of buying even higher. To combat higher financing costs, homebuyers have turned to making larger down payments. Down payments rose to a peak in the third quarter of 14.7%, according to a recent Realtor.com report. “Nevertheless, the cost of borrowing remains high,” she said. Even after the move lower, today’s rates are unlikely to draw more than the most motivated buyers back into the market, Hale said. “If rates can hold onto this improvement, or notch a further decline, however, this could mean that ‘buying a home’ does seem like a viable new year’s resolution to a greater number of households,” Hale said.",Business
5 takeaways from America’s biggest crypto crackdown in history," The US government just sent a clear message to the world of cryptocurrency, a market valued at around $1.4 trillion. Just as crypto investors were hoping to move on from the historic conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and former CEO of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange, US officials displayed yet another show of force against criminal activity surrounding crypto. Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pled guilty on Tuesday to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, potentially allowing bad actors of all kinds to use the platform to move money. Here are five takeaways from the largest penalty ever imposed on a money services business in United States history, which just so happens to be a crypto firm: Zhao and Bankman-Fried were largely seen as the faces of the crypto industry. Now his guilty plea, along with Bankman-Fried’s conviction, means that good actors in the crypto industry will have to make a more convincing case to skeptics to prove the two were exceptions and not the norm. In light of Tuesday’s news, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, took the opportunity to distinguish the crypto exchange he heads from Binance, which admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations. “Since the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time,” Armstrong said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon. “Today’s news reinforces that doing it the hard way was the right decision. We now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry,” he added. At the same time, the government agencies overseeing crypto regulation and compliance don’t want people to forget Bankman-Fried and Zhao. “In just the past month, the Justice Department has successfully prosecuted the CEOs of two of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges in two separate criminal cases,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disrupter. It makes you a criminal.” Cryptocurrencies dipped on Tuesday as investors digested the latest regulatory news out of Washington DC. But by Wednesday, they had made a roaring comeback. Binance coin initially dropped about 6% after the US Department of Justice announced that it had brought charges against Zhao following a multi-year investigation into Binance. On Wednesday morning, prices had swung 3.5% higher. Other cryptocurrencies suffered on Tuesday as a larger crackdown by the Feds also roped in crypto firms like Kraken and Tether. Bitcoin dropped by about $420, 1.1%, to $37,071. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell by $40, or 2%, to $1,997 per coin. By Wednesday, both bitcoin and ethereum were back up. Bitcoin was up by 2.4%, and ethereum was 5% higher. So what explains the swings? Some reports out late on Tuesday suggested that Zhao’s deal with the Department of Justice could allow him to keep the majority of Binance’s shares. That buoyed investors’ hopes. They were also simply eager to see the long investigation finally wrap up. Overall, it’s been a good year for crypto. Bitcoin is up by about 120% year-to-date. Ethereum has risen nearly 70% over the same period. The deal Binance reached with the government requires it to cease operating in the US. On Tuesday evening people based in the US were greeted with a notice on the Binance.com site saying it “is unavailable in your country or region.” But there’s a bit of fine print. “If you are in the United States or select U.S. territories, Binance.US is a U.S. regulated platform where you can buy, trade, convert, and stake crypto with low fees,” the notice continued. Binance.US is a subsidiary of Binance that was created in 2019 to “to serve U.S. consumers and adhere to U.S. regulations,” according to a post on the site. Binance.US is not impacted by Tuesday’s announcement, since it is a registered money services business, Treasury officials said. That means that people in the US could still buy and sell crypto under the Binance roof. Tuesday’s announcement is a vivid example of the federal government’s tough stance on illicit activities involving crypto. To put it simply, the feds — from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Treasury Department — aren’t playing around. Just this week, the SEC sued Kraken, another crypto exchange, alleging that it is operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The agency’s suit also alleges that the exchange comingled customers’ assets with the company’s own holdings. That is not the first time the SEC has sued Kraken. In fact, it is one of several suits the agency has filed just this year against crypto companies such as Bittrex and Coinbase. The SEC’s suit against Binance for allegedly violating investor-protection laws remains in litigation. Despite suffering some unfavorable rulings this year, the SEC is expected to continue to aggressively clamp down on crypto firms by taking them to court. But if Tuesday’s major announcement made anything clear, it is not only the SEC that is trying to keep crypto malfeasance at bay: It is the entire federal government. That also includes the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Treasury Department. There is even a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team within the Justice Department actively identifying and investigating criminal cases involving digital assets. “While criminal and civil enforcement actions are subject to different legal standards, this collective effort represents the whole-of-government approach that we are taking to combat corporate crime,” Garland said Tuesday. US officials already have a nifty toolbox of regulations at their disposal to root out financial crimes, such as laws criminalizing money laundering and bank fraud. That is precisely how the feds secured the first ever corporate settlement with a crypto exchange. “You have seen both in our actions today and in prior cases that we will be relentless in using every tool that we currently have to deploy against those who seek to use technologies in a way that abuse those platforms … or [that] don’t prevent the use of those platforms for illicit activities,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said during Tuesday’s presser. But officials suggested that there’s room for new regulation. Calls for “regulatory clarity” are not new, and new crypto regulations could help both investors and law enforcement officials discern legitimate crypto products from criminal facades. It is unclear how or when comprehensive crypto regulation would come about. One way is through rulemaking at the agency level either at the SEC or CFTC, which would still be subject to judicial review if challenged in the courts, and another is through Congress. “I’ve advocated for filling in some of these gaps, specifically around commodity tokens, and I do think if we’re able to do that, obviously with Congress’s help, we can prevent these actions from happening and not have to be here after the fact,” CFTC Chair Rostin Benham said Tuesday.",Business
"OpenAI: The cast of characters of Silicon Valley’s latest, juiciest upheaval"," When technology firm OpenAI ousted its CEO Sam Altman last week with little warning and less explanation, it set off shockwaves throughout Silicon Valley and beyond. Late Tuesday, in a complete reversal, he rejoined the controversial firm he had helped found, effectively bouncing from the board some of the people who had fired him. Altman has served as a poster boy of the company’s groundbreaking efforts in artificial intelligence, including its ChatGPT generative AI product. But the drama pushed a web of other characters key to AI or internet history into view of the public. Some have worked together for years and have invented some of the household name products of the internet. What has made this tale so unusual and so magnetic? The speed at which it went down, the diversity and (relative) youth of the board of directors and the nature of the company — a non-profit thought to become a tremendously profitable one at one point. Marquee names like Elon Must and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella fueled interest, too, as did the long-standing friendships between some of the whiz-kid players. But, perhaps most of all, there appears to be a moral, or at least procedural, split between some past and present OpenAI executives and board members over the considerable threat posed by the technology itself and the people who would control it. With echoes of Shakespearean dramas as well as hit TV series such as “Game of Thrones,” “Billions” and “Succession,” here are some of the characters involved in the boardroom and backroom brawling at OpenAI. Sam Altman Former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman became a household name over the past year as OpenAI’s ChatGPT gained 180 million users seemingly overnight, revolutionizing technology and threatening to turn some industries upside down. Altman, 38, spoke to Congress in May and said, AI technology “can go quite wrong, and we want to be vocal about that.” Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he dropped out of Stanford University to work on a location app called Loopt. That startup was in the first batch of eight at an accelerator called Y Combinator, along with Reddit and a company called Kiko co-founded by OpenAI’s interim head Emmett Shear. Before OpenAI, Altman was president of Y Combinator, mentoring a host of founders and expanding his network in Silicon Valley. Satya Nadella As CEO of Microsoft, a 49% stakeholder in OpenAI, Nadella could have been the biggest loser in Altman’s departure from OpenAI. Then, Nadella’s tweet Monday announcing a new AI division headed by former OpenAI co-founders made him, and Microsoft, a winner. Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday following the announcement after dropping 1.7% in the immediate aftermath of Altman’s firing. With Altman back at OpenAI, its stock is back near an all time high over $379 a share. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. Mira Murati Named by the OpenAI board as Altman’s interim successor on Friday, Murati was replaced by Shear before the weekend was done. After her short stint as interim CEO, Murati signed a letter along with an estimated 700 other OpenAI employees threatening to quit over Altman’s dismissal and calling for the resignation of the board. Murati, 34, CTO of OpenAI, joined the company in 2018. The Albanian-born Murati is in charge of the distribution of image generator DALL-E and text-based ChatGPT. She graduated from Colby College and Dartmouth University and has worked at Tesla. “Mira has helped to scale the company from a startup to one of the most important AI companies in the world,” Nadella wrote in an essay about her for Time magazine in September. Ilya Sutskever In 2019, Brockman, Altman and Sutskever jointly formed OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity that exists within the larger nonprofit company’s structure, which helped take OpenAI to a proposed valuation of $90 billion in just a few years. Sutskever’s fate could be in jeopardy given his role in the board drama. Sutskever is OpenAI’s chief scientist, co-founder and a board member who appears to have played an outsized role in Altman’s firing. Sutskever later signed the employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman and Brockman to return. On Monday, as news of the letter emerged, Sutskever posted an apology on X: “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions,” he said. “I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we’ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.” His future with the company now seems unclear. Adam D’Angelo D’Angelo joined OpenAI’s board in 2018 and will remain on it even after the upheaval. In high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, he developed music suggestion software along with other students including Mark Zuckerberg. After graduating from the California Institute of Technology, he worked at Facebook as chief technology officer and founded the questions and answers platform Quora in 2009. He was one of the OpenAI board members who voted to oust Altman. D’Angelo has praised OpenAI’s unorthodox board structure (non-profit controlled with a for-profit entity within), telling Forbes in January, “my hope is that we can do a lot more good for the world than just become another corporation that gets that big.” Bret Taylor The new board chair at OpenAI, Bret Taylor, was formerly the chair of the board at Twitter that forced Elon Musk to make good on his acquisition attempt. Before that, Taylor was co-CEO at Salesforce and worked at Facebook, Google and other companies. He has two degrees in computer science from Stanford University. Emmett Shear Shear, 40-year-old co-founder of Amazon’s streaming service Twitch, announced Monday he would join OpenAI as interim CEO. He replaced Mira Murati, who was named interim CEO, and held the job for less than 48 hours, after Altman was fired. It’s unclear what his role will be now that Altman is back. A native of Seattle, Washington, and a graduate of Yale University, Shear was one of four co-founders of Justin.tv, an early precursor to Twitch built to livestream the life of Justin Kan, Shear’s childhood friend and classmate. In 2011. Shear was also once a Microsoft intern — though it seems the now-CEO was not a fan. He tweeted in July, “When I was interning for Microsoft every paycheck felt like I was getting the payment for a little chunk of my soul in the mail.” Tasha McCauley McCauley joined the board of OpenAI in 2018 and is chief executive officer of GeoSim Systems, a 3D city modeling company based in Israel. She once served as CEO of a robotics company called Fellow Robots and has been an adjunct senior management scientist at Rand Corporation. Married to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, she serves on the advisory board of the Centre for the Governance of AI. McCauley has a bachelor’s from Bard College and an MBA from the University of Southern California. Greg Brockman Greg Brockman co-founded OpenAI and quit his role as President in protest after Altman’s firing and joined Microsoft Monday. Wednesday morning he said on X, “Returning to OpenAI & getting back to coding tonight.” His exact role is still unclear. Brockman grew up in North Dakota before attending Harvard University and MIT. He dropped out of MIT to work for Stripe, eventually becoming chief technology officer of the payment-processing firm. That startup received investment from Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others in 2011. He left Stripe in 2015 to start OpenAI with Altman and Musk. Helen Toner Toner joined AI’s board in 2021. She is a director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology and previously worked as a senior research analyst at Open Philanthropy, focusing on AI policy and strategy. She lived in Beijing and studied China’s AI ecosystem as a researcher with Centre for the Governance of AI, an organization where she serves on the advisory board. Toner has a bachelor’s in chemical engineering and a master’s in security studies from Georgetown. Joshua Kushner Kushner heads VC firm Thrive Capital and is a major tech investor. Thrive was reportedly leading a funding round in October to buy OpenAI shares at a price that would value the company at $80 billion, according to Crunchbase and other reports. That funding would also have valued shares that OpenAI employees may receive as compensation. Kushner is the brother of Jared Kushner and husband of supermodel Karlie Kloss. His father, Charles Kushner, was pardoned by then-president Donald Trump in 2020 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Kushner co-founded Oscar Health and is a minority owner of the Memphis Grizzlies. He’s an alumnus of Harvard College and Harvard Business School. Larry Summers Summers is an economist who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations including as a Treasury Secretary. He joined the OpenAI board on Wednesday as the company welcomed back Altman and others. Summers brings leadership experience from politics, corporate boards and having served as former president of Harvard University. Shivon Zilis Another previous OpenAI board member, Zilis exited in March. The director at Neuralink, Musk’s brain implant start-up, is the mother of two children with the billionaire, according to Musk biographer Walter Isaacson. In September, she joined the board of directors of Shield AI, a defense technology company building AI pilot technology for aircraft. Born in Canada, Zilis graduated from Yale University. Will Hurd After joining the OpenAI board in 2021, Hurd was the third director to exit in 2023. He left because he was running for President of the United States as a Republican. He dropped out of the race in October and endorsed Nikki Haley. A former Texas congressman and CIA officer, Hurd joined OpenAI while working at investment bank Allen & Company and was seen as bringing public policy expertise. Hurd was born and raised in Texas and graduated from Texas A&M University, where he majored in computer science and was elected student body president. Reid Hoffman LinkedIn co-founder Hoffman left OpenAI’s board in March citing conflicts of interest with other AI ventures. Just two months later, his company Inflection AI unveiled a ChatGPT-like chatbot named Pi. Hoffman was also an early investor in OpenAI. Hoffman and Musk were part of the PayPal founding team before Hoffman became co-founder, CEO and Chairman of LinkedIn. He’s been a tech investor with several firms including a partner at Greylock Partners for the past 14 years. He’s on the board of several companies including Microsoft. He has a bachelor’s from Stanford University and a master’s from Oxford in philosophy. Elon Musk Musk, a co-founder and previous board member of OpenAI, left in 2018 citing a conflict of interest with Tesla. Musk has since expressed safety concerns over AI’s threat to society and the possibility that Microsoft would take over the company. Musk, one of the richest people in the world, leads several companies including SpaceX, Tesla, the Boring Company, and the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk is connected to many characters in the OpenAI drama and has publicly feuded with Altman about the future of AI. “What tangled webs we weave,” he wrote on X, shortly after Altman was announced back at OpenAI early Wednesday morning. This is an ongoing story. It will be updated.",Business
Gas prices could fall further as oil drops 4% on OPEC meeting delay," Oil prices tumbled more than 4% Wednesday after a group of the biggest oil producing nations said they would delay a meeting, originally scheduled for Sunday, that was expected to discuss making further cuts to global supply. Brent crude, the global benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the US benchmark, both fell over 4% late morning ET. Brent traded down 3.7% to $79 a barrel, and WTI down 3.8% to $75 a barrel, by 11.49 a.m. ET. The drops could bring more good news for US drivers filling up at the pump over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. The average price of a gallon of regular gas currently stands at $3.28, according to the AAA, down nearly 8% in a month and 10% below where it was this time last year. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, said in a statement that it would postpone its ministerial meeting till November 30, without providing a reason. Reuters reported, citing OPEC+ sources, that the meeting had been delayed due to a disagreement around the current production levels of some members and possible cuts associated with them. Likewise, earlier on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were unhappy with some OPEC members’ levels of output. “That the (oil) price plunged on the back of this suggests traders believe there may not be full agreement on the scale of output cuts going into next year,” Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA, wrote in a note. Both Brent and WTI prices have fallen for four consecutive weeks, pressured by record crude oil production in the United States and worries about waning global demand, particularly in China, the world’s biggest oil importer. Brent is down 18% since late September, while WTI has entered a bear market after falling 20% since its peak that month. Prices have declined despite a pledge by OPEC+ in April to slash its total output by 1.66 million barrels per day until the end of the year, and additional voluntary cuts announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia in the months since. Jorge León, senior vice-president at Rystad Energy, wrote in a note Wednesday that he could not “completely rule out the possibility of a deadlock at this point” between OPEC+ countries trying to agree further cuts. León noted that such ministerial meetings had been postponed before “but never for four days,” adding that it would be difficult for several OPEC+ members, including Russia and Nigeria, to accept lower production targets. Rystad still expects OPEC+ to reach an agreement at the meeting on November 30, but the process will likely be “challenging,” he added.",Business
Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes," Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. “We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker’s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman’s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman’s ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company’s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.” Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” Altman’s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. “Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?” But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI’s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft’s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. — CNN’s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.",Business
EU stops advertising on X over hate speech. Fines could follow next year," The European Union is pulling its advertisements from Elon Musk’s X for now, citing an “alarming increase” in hate speech and disinformation on the platform formerly known as Twitter. A more drastic move could come next year. The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, could impose a fine of more than $100 million on X if the company is found to have breached tough new EU rules aimed at cleaning up digital media. “We have seen an alarming increase in disinformation and hate speech on several social media platforms in recent weeks,” Johannes Bahrke, a European Commission spokesperson, said Friday. Bahrke said the commission had advised EU institutions “to refrain from advertising” on platforms where such content was present, adding that he could confirm only that X had been affected by the temporary ban. In October, a few days after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel, the European Commission asked X to provide details of the actions it was taking to combat the spread of “illegal content and disinformation” on its platform. The commission is currently reviewing X’s response and deciding on its next steps. It has also asked TikTok and Facebook parent Meta for similar information. Social media companies operating in the EU are bound by obligations set out in the Digital Services Act, landmark legislation, enacted in August, that seeks to regulate large tech companies more stringently and protect people’s rights online. Under the DSA, companies found to have flouted its rules can be fined up to 6% of their annual global revenue. Musk, who became the owner of X a little over a year ago, expects the company to generate $3 billion in revenue this year, according to a Reuters report in July. That means, should the European Commission find that X has broken DSA rules, the company could be fined as much as $180 million. X did not respond to a CNN request for comment. However, a fine is unlikely until next year as each of the EU’s 27 member states first needs to appoint national “digital services coordinators” — with the power to impose penalties — by February 17. So far, only two states, Italy and Hungary, have done so, a commission spokesperson told CNN. A tidal wave of antisemitism, Islamophobia and misinformation has engulfed social media platforms in recent weeks since the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas, followed by air strikes and a ground offensive by Israel against the Hamas-controlled enclave of Gaza. Some of that hateful content has been embraced by Musk, the world’s richest man. Last Wednesday, in an X post to his 164 million followers, Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which claims that Jewish communities promulgate hate against white people. That conspiracy theory motivated the killer of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 — the deadliest attack against Jewish people in American history. Musk has denied accusations that he is antisemitic, saying in a post Sunday that “nothing could be further from the truth.” But that hasn’t stopped a slew of prominent media companies, including Disney and Paramount, from pulling their ads from X. The European Commission, which recently sounded the alarm on a sharp rise in antisemitism in Europe, has so far stopped short of criticizing Musk directly. A commission spokesperson declined to comment to CNN on Musk’s X post from last Wednesday. In contrast, on Friday, the White House has condemned the post. “It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN. “We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms.” The European Commission said on November 5 that it had seen “a resurgence of antisemitic incidents and rhetoric” within its borders in recent weeks, including attacks on synagogues in Germany and Spain, and on a Jewish cemetery in Austria. “In these difficult times the EU stands by its Jewish communities. We condemn these despicable acts in the strongest possible terms,” it said in a statement. Germany’s Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency, which promotes equal treatment at work and in everyday life, announced on October 11 that it would stop using X entirely, citing an “enormous increase” in discriminatory and hateful speech on the platform. And it called out Musk directly. “Ministries and state bodies should ask themselves whether it is still acceptable to remain on a platform that has become a disinformation network and whose owner spreads antisemitic, racist and populist content,” Ferda Ataman, Germany’s independent federal commissioner for anti-discrimination, said in a statement. In an email to CNN Wednesday, Ataman added that there “cannot be any justification for public institutions to support X by continuing to use this platform.” She said “the spread of conspiracy theories, antisemitism and hate speech on X as well as the continued support of hateful and antisemitic content by Musk” proved that point. Europe’s new digital rules do not include powers to fine individuals for the content they post on social media. In theory, X’s content moderators should hold Musk to account. Sandra Wachter, a professor of technology and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, said they are required by the DSA to treat their boss like any other user by, for example, taking down his posts or flagging them as problematic if they break EU rules. “There you see the conflict of interest,” Wachter added, acknowledging the extraordinary difficulty of expecting X employees to police their own boss.",Business
This Moroccan startup is growing crops in the desert," Climate change means desertification is a growing problem, with 250 million people directly impacted by the degradation of formerly fertile land. The issue affects a third of the Earth’s land surface, according to the United Nations, parching parts of Africa, South America, southern Europe, China and a third of US soil. Reclaiming arid land and turning it back into agricultural fields could be key to ensuring we are able to feed the planet’s population. Sand to Green is a Moroccan startup that can transform a patch of desert into a sustainable and profitable plantation in five years, according to Wissal Ben Moussa, its co-founder and chief agricultural officer. “Desertification is the future of a lot of countries today,” she says. “Our solution is using agroforestry to create a new kind of agriculture that is sustainable and that can be resilient in front of climate change.” The system can be deployed anywhere near a source of brackish water, which Sand to Green desalinates using solar-powered technology. It then plants a variety of fruit-producing trees and herbs in the same space — a practice known as intercropping — and drip-irrigates their roots directly with the desalinated water, to minimize evaporation. The soil is regenerated using what Sand to Green calls “green manure,” a mixture that includes compost, biochar and microorganisms that help the soil “wake up,” according to Ben Moussa. Biochar is a form of charcoal that can help arid soils retain water. This allows some herbs to be ready for harvest after just two years. In a five-hectare trial in southern Morocco that’s been running since 2017, Sand to Green has tried out a variety of plants in search of the best perfomers. “My top three favorite trees are carob, fig and pomegranate,” Ben Moussa says. “They are endemic to the regions where we want to deploy, have high added value when it comes to the produce, but they are also very resilient.” Among the intercropping herbs that have been successfully trialed are rosemary, geranium, vetiver and citronella, which Ben Moussa describes as “very low-maintenance and very high-margin.” A 2018 review by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification found that the global economy was set to lose $23 trillion by 2050 because of land degradation, while taking urgent action would cost only a fraction of that — $4.6 trillion. Land degradation or drought affect 169 countries, with Asia and Africa the hardest-hit. Efforts to grow crops in desert environments are spreading. The International Center for Biosaline Agriculture is growing salt-tolerant superfoods in the sandy soil of Dubai, while in Tanzania, non-profits are using mounds of earth known as bunds to trap water so that it can penetrate parched ground, allowing grasses to return. Sand to Green is now working to scale up to a 20-hectare commercial proof-of-concept site, also in southern Morocco. It says a site of that size would cost around €450,000 ($475,000) to set up and would start bringing financial returns in about five years. “With this system we create biodiversity, which means better soil, healthier crops and a bigger yield,” Ben Moussa says. “Our plantation can generate 1.5 times more yield and thus more revenue than a monoculture plantation in the same area.” When commercialized, each piece of land will be divided into plantations that will be provided as a “green investment,” Ben Moussa says, with Sand to Green handling every step from inception to fruition. Revenues will be shared between the investors and Sand to Green. Earlier this year, the company raised $1 million in seed funding, and there are plans for an additional, 500-hectare project, again in Morocco. Sand to Green says its techniques could be used in countries including Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, Egypt, in the Arabian peninsula, some parts of the United States, and on the Mexican coast. “We can go anywhere in the world as long as we have access to brackish water,” Ben Moussa says. “The good news is that there is a lot of it along coastal areas.”",Business
Warren Buffett donates $870 million to charities ahead of Thanksgiving," Warren Buffett is donating about $870 million to four family-run  foundations ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, continuing a tradition of giving away his massive wealth of about $120 billion. The donations are in the form of shares, with a release from his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate detailing that 1.5 million shares are going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which is named after his wife. Another 900,000 shares are being divided evenly among three charities run by his children. Buffett said the donations “repeat those made at Thanksgiving last year” and that they “supplement certain of the lifetime pledges I made in 2006 and that continue until my death (at 93, I feel good but fully realize I am playing in extra innings).” Last year, he donated about $750 million to the same foundations. He’s been making the same donations yearly since 2006. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote on Tuesday that he and his children “have a common belief that dynastic wealth, though both legal and common in much of the world including the United States, is not desirable.” “We also agree that capitalism — whatever its weaknesses, including the vast disparities in wealth and political influence that it delivers somewhat capriciously to its citizens — has worked wonders and continues to work wonders,” he wrote. The letter also said that “Berkshire’s advantage is that it has been built to last” and that the company’s “distinctive characteristics and behavior will be supported by my large Berkshire holdings.” The 93-year-old remains in control of the sprawling company. He named Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire Hathaway’s non-insurance business, as his successor in 2021. Berkshire Hathaway recently reported a surge in third-quarter operating earnings and a record-high cash pile of $157 billion.",Business
What’s open and closed on Thanksgiving Day 2023," Thanksgiving Day has looked different in recent years. Sights of people lining up at 5 pm Thanksgiving Day at large retailers to catch Black Friday deals are rare since the onset of the pandemic. Many stores opted to close its doors on Thanksgiving in 2020 to limit crowding and spread out the holiday shopping season — and made the decision permanent. This year, the turkey day falls on Thursday, Nov. 23. Here’s what’s open and closed on Thanksgiving Day 2023. Target is closed on Thanksgiving Day. The closure on Thursday began for the first time in 2020. “Once I heard from team members how much they appreciated that time with their families, it was an easy decision to make the policy permanent, and our store teams have had that time off ever since,” CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement in November. Walmart also won’t be open on Thanksgiving. “It’s a thing of the past. We’ll again be closed on Thanksgiving,” Walmart (WMT) US CEO John Furner said in an NBC interview last year. Best Buy will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. Among department stores, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom will be closed. Most Walgreens locations will be closed, marking the first time the pharmacy chain has closed stores on Thanksgiving day, it said. However, nearly all of its 700 24-hour locations will remain open to help meet healthcare needs. The chain has faced staffing shortages and walkouts from pharmacy employees in recent months. CVS Health said it’s closing all of its non-24 hour stores early on Thanksgiving. Rite Aid said its pharmacies will be closed but its retail locations will be open with varying hours. If you need to pop in to a grocery store last minute, there are a few options. H.E.B is open from 6 am to 12 pm. Whole Foods has modified hours, and said to check with local stores for details. Most of Albertsons’ stores — such as Safeway, Albertsons, Jewel-Osco, Acma, Vons and Tom Thumb — will be open on Thanksgiving Day with modified hours. Kroger said most of its stores will close early, but to make sure to check specific hours for local stores. All Publix stores will be closed on Thanksgiving. So will Aldi, Trader Joe’s and Costco. Thanksgiving is a government holiday, so federal offices, courts and post offices will be closed. Other government institutions — think the DMV and local libraries — will also be closed. Thanksgiving is a banking holiday. The Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading. Most banks branches will be closed, but online banking and ATMs will still be available for use. Don’t expect any packages on Thanksgiving day. USPS will be closed. All UPS and FedEx services will be closed except for UPS Express Critical and FedEx Custon Critical. – CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report.",Business
"Jake Tapper reveals challenges of covering war, why he feels news outlets ‘censor too much’ and what has left him ‘shocked’"," The relentless war between Israel and Hamas has led to a staggering number of civilian deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people in Gaza, spawning an urgent humanitarian crisis. It’s also presented a high-stakes conundrum for the international press as the conflict captures the attention of the world and the line separating fact from fiction remains shrouded in fog. Each and every day, journalists covering the Middle East conflict are faced with thorny challenges, many of which they must grapple with in real-time. We spoke with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday for a wide-ranging interview about reporting on the war. Below, you’ll find our unedited Q&A. What has been the most challenging aspect about reporting on the Israel-Hamas war? As always, it’s the fog of war. Not knowing exactly what is going on for sure at any given moment, first reports being inadequate, sources for information being biased, the difficulty of knowing what is happening on a battlefield, the near impossibility of getting hard, cold facts in real-time. As a journalist, how have you balanced the need to show the graphic nature of Hamas’ savage attack, while also knowing your broadcast is being carried on air and that such images can potentially disturb viewers? This is an issue I struggle with all the time and have been for more than a decade. There’s a page at the beginning of my 2012 book “The Outpost” in which I wrestle with just describing *in print* how graphic to be. I generally feel that we in the news media writ large, all over the world, censor too much. There is part of me that thinks if we showed more of what war is and what gun violence is and what fentanyl and opioids actually do, the better the journalism we would be providing. But these are fights I lose, and I understand why I lose them. I just don’t think we should pretend that hiding these images is any less of an overt act than showing them. In any case, what happened on October 7 to the Israelis, and subsequently the hostages, is such an important part of what is going on right now in Gaza, and I think it is important to show the world. The Israelis perceive Hamas to be an existential threat to their survival. Whatever you think of the IDF response, and I am not defending it or prosecuting it, October 7 marked the end of Israel’s containment strategy when it comes to Hamas. And it is part of the story. And the framing of what happened on October 7 by much of the Arab world, and much of the progressive world in the United States, which in some cases includes outright denialism, is also part of the story. I am reminded of what General Eisenhower said after his decision to invite the news media to witness what the soldiers saw when they began liberating the concentration camps. “I think people ought to know about such things… I think the people ought to know what they are fighting for and the kind of person they are fighting.” Last week, you published an important — and equally disturbing — story about Israeli police investigating cases of sexual assault committed during Hamas’ assault. The report has touched off a larger conversation in the international community, with some critics noting there has been relatively little attention paid to the topic. Do you believe it deserves more focus? It’s shocking. The degree to which Hamas terrorists raped and committed sexually violent acts on women and girls on October 7 is hideous, and there is evidence and witnesses to the degradation. It was a very difficult story to do because again it was so graphic and horrifying. And where is the international women’s community? Where is the U.S. feminist community? Do these girls and women not count as victims for some reason? I wasn’t aware victimhood for rape came with an asterisk. On the other hand, there have been some critics who believe the news media, broadly speaking, has not been doing an adequate job showing the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza. What are your thoughts on such critiques? I’ve seen a ton of strong coverage that gives glimpses into life in Gaza, but it is incredibly dangerous to be there right now. Journalists have been killed. The problem as U.S. policymakers explain it is twofold: First and foremost, Hamas staged this brutal attack on Israel on October 7 and ran back into Gaza where they embed within the population. And their spokesmen have been very clear in their public pronouncements that they do not particularly care about the loss of life of Palestinian civilians, and that they have spent money on tunnels for their own safety, that of Hamas fighters, and they consider it the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the Palestinian civilians. Second, and the Biden administration has been pretty clear about this, in their view Israel is not doing enough to protect civilian casualties during its bombing campaign against Hamas. So thousands of innocent civilians have been killed and it is undeniably horrific. Journalists are working every day to get into Gaza and safely report stories out, documenting the horrors of war and loss of human life. Because of the factors above, not to mention the near impossibility of getting in and out of Gaza, covering this war has proved challenging compared to, say, Iraq, Afghanistan or Ukraine. The war has given way to an alarming surge in antisemitism across the globe. As one of the most high-profile Jewish anchors in the world, have you seen a spike in bigoted attacks that target you personally? My faith only guides my journalism in the sense that I know what it’s like to be a religious minority so I apply that across the board to Muslims, Mormons, Catholics and to everyone else. I don’t assume that because someone is of one particular faith that they have certain views. That’s about it. I see the war as a journalist and as a human. I want the human suffering to end now. And I would prefer a world where all peoples can live with democracy and self-determination. This is a time where antisemitism is without a doubt on the rise and I’ve certainly seen an uptick online, but ugly words are just that: words. It’s nothing compared to what the people in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank are currently going through. More than 50 journalists have now died in the region since the onset of the war, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. What is your message to the reporters who are risking their lives to deliver this story to the world? I’ve long lived in awe of folks who risk their lives to cover wars. I’ve been to war zones in Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Israel, but always taking limited risks. I can’t imagine having anything worthwhile to say to the people who charge into far more dangerous terrain. Switching gears, I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask you about the Home for Our Troops auction, in which you teamed up with the likes of George Clooney, Wynonna Judd, Don Cheadle and Mindy Kaling to raise money for injured post-9/11 veterans. How did the auction do this year? What was the number one item? We had a great year, thanks for asking, raising more than $400,000! And since pretty much all of that goes to building the specially adapted, mortgage free homes for severely injured US veterans — and the team putting the auction together consists pretty much of me annoying celebrities, the fabulous celebrities themselves giving in to my pestering pleadings, and one employee of Homes for Our Troops — it’s a decent accomplishment. Every year the number one item is different. This year, I thought it was going to be 18 holes of golf with Jason Bateman and Will Arnett at the Bel Air country club but then it ended up being two tickets to the premiere of Jake Gyllenhaal’s next movie. I think that’s gonna be Roadhouse, so no doubt money well spent.",Business
Chicken wings are on Popeyes menu for good," Popeyes wants to recapture some of the magic from its chicken sandwich debut with a new line of wings. Starting Wednesday, customers will be able to get Honey BBQ wings, Roasted Garlic Parmesan wings and Signature Hot wings at Popeyes locations across the country, along with the Ghost Pepper and Sweet N’Spicy wings that Popeyes says proved popular when they were sold earlier this year. They go for $5.99 for a pack of six. Back in 2019, Popeyes’ chicken sandwich created a frenzy in the fast food industry, prompting a wave of copycats and became a barometer for success. With wings, Popeyes thinks it can rekindle that enthusiasm, at least in part. And, chicken sandwich aside, it’s a good time to get into the wings game, with cheap eats gaining ground as some customers rein in spending. Over the past few years, Popeyes has brought wings to the menu on a limited-time basis. But customer interest has earned the items a lasting place on the menu, Sami Siddiqui, president of Popeyes North America, told CNN. “In January, when we were running our Ghost Pepper wing [promotion], we saw incredible demand,” he said. “The offer was supposed to last for about six weeks. And we sold out of wings in two weeks.” This summer, Popeyes rolled out another version of the wings, this time with a sweet and spicy sauce. That one did even better, Siddiqui said. “It was actually the most successful product and results we’ve seen since the infamous chicken sandwich.” When it debuted in 2019, the chicken sandwich prompted throngs of hungry people to mob Popeyes locations in search of the item, which sold out in just about two weeks. Popeyes ultimately brought the sandwich back, permanently, and saw its overall sales skyrocket. With wings, Siddiqui said, Popeyes once again saw long lines and a sales lift. In the third quarter, sales at Popeyes locations open at least 17 months jumped 5.6% in the United States year-over-year, thanks in part to chicken wings. The customer reaction “reinforced and solidified our view that we need to have five permanent flavors of wings on the menu,” he said. Siddiqui doesn’t expect enthusiasm over Popeyes wings to reach the same kind of fervor inspired by the chicken sandwich. “It’s really hard to replicate what was sort of [like] lightning in a bottle,” he said. But he does see some similarities, including a relatively low price. Other chains have seen success with chicken wings in recent months, as people cut back on spending by buying cheaper food. Wingstop’s domestic same-restaurant sales, which include sales at restaurants open at least a year, jumped 15.3% in the third quarter. When customers ditch pricier options, “Wingstop is uniquely positioned to gain more new guests,” CEO Michael Skipworth said during a November analyst call discussing quarterly results. Some customers aren’t necessarily switching from other food to wings, but see wings as a reasonably priced addition, Siddiqui said. “If you’re coming for a sandwich, or you’re coming for tenders, for $5.99 you’ll add on six wings,” said Siddiqui.

CEO of Chinese online game streaming firm arrested amid executive crackdown," The chairman and CEO of Chinese video game live-streaming platform DouYu has been arrested, becoming the latest business leader to run afoul of authorities in the world’s second largest economy. DouYu (DOYU) said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that its chief, Chen Shaojie, had been arrested by police in the southwestern city of Chengdu on or around November 16. The company said it had only been informed of the arrest on Monday. It “has not received any official notice of the investigation against Mr. Chen or the reasons for Mr. Chen’s apparent arrest,” it added, warning that his “ongoing detention and any subsequent related legal proceedings and enforcement actions” could have a material impact on its business. In a statement posted on Chinese social media on Wednesday, police in Chengdu said a 39-year-old man surnamed Chen was arrested on suspicion of opening a casino. State-run news agency Xinhua cited the statement as confirmation that the DouYu executive had been arrested. The news came two weeks after the Cover News, a state-owned media outlet , reported that Chen had become unreachable. It cited unconfirmed reports that Chen was being investigated and had been missing for nearly three weeks. Chen’s disappearance came about five months after the Cyberspace Administration of China launched an onsite inspection of DouYu to investigate what it called “serious” problems related to the platform, including alleged pornography and “vulgar” content, according to a May statement from the internet watchdog. Douyu, which means “fighting fish” in Chinese, has also come under scrutiny for allegedly hosting online gambling, which is illegal in mainland China. Last December, three people running a popular account on the platform were each sentenced to up to six years in prison after being found guilty of “opening casinos” by the Intermediate People’s Court in Chengdu, according to state media. They had run an online lottery that invited users to place bets, which attracted about 4.4 million users, and collected almost 120 million yuan ($16.9 million), the court said in a statement. The court described it as the first gambling case involving a live-streaming platform that police had handled under the direct orders of the Ministry of Public Security, suggesting it was of national significance and should serve as “a warning to society.” In its latest filing, DouYu said it was committed to complying with regulations. The company is currently operating as normal, while working on contingency plans in response to Chen’s arrest, it added. DouYu, which said in its filing that it could not comment on any pending legal proceedings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. Chen is one of the latest high-flying executives in China to come under scrutiny by authorities. This year, more than a dozen leaders from industries including technology, finance and real estate have gone missing, faced detention or been subjected to corruption probes. International consulting firms have also faced rising risks, such as the possibility of raids or detentions of executives. The developments have had a chilling effect on China’s business community, with some entrepreneurs said to be lying low in response to the uncertainty. Chen founded DouYu and quickly built it into one of China’s most valuable startups. Often compared to Amazon’s Twitch service, the Tencent-backed company hosts interactive live-streams of video games while letting users chat in real time and inviting them to watch other content created for its platform. DouYu’s shares closed nearly 6% in New York on Tuesday following news of the arrest.",Business
"What is Binance, why is it in so much trouble, and what does it mean for crypto?"," There are few figures in crypto that have loomed quite as large in the past few years than Changpeng Zhao — better known as CZ — and the company he founded in 2017, Binance. Not only is Binance the world’s biggest crypto exchange, it is orders of magnitude larger than its rivals. Up until recently, Binance boasted nearly 60% of the market share for crypto spot trading. Even as that share has waned to closer to 40% since US regulators amped up pressure on the company starting in June, no other exchange even comes close. The Seychelles-based OKX is second in market share at 5.44% and the US exchange Coinbase is third at 5.37%, according to crypto news site CoinDesk. But Binance’s future at the top of the crypto world is now far from certain as it faces a record $4.3 billion payout to US authorities to resolve criminal charges. Zhao on Tuesday resigned as CEO and pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges. US officials called the settlement the biggest-ever corporate resolution involving criminal charges for an executive. Following a multiyear investigation, US authorities said Binance allowed bad actors on the platform, enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics and terrorist financing. Further, Binance did not have protocols to flag or report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. As one compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents: ﻿“we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.’” Zhao faces a maximum of 10 years behind bars, though his ultimate sentence will likely be far lower. He also agreed to pay a $50 million criminal fine and a $150 million civil penalty. “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,” Zhao posted on X. “This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself. Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run.” Binance, like its infamous former rival FTX, has been quick to point out that it grew its business rapidly in a chaotic, largely unregulated industry. “While Binance is not perfect, it has strived to protect users since its early days as a small startup and has made tremendous efforts to invest in security and compliance,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Binance grew at an extremely fast pace globally… [and] made misguided decisions along the way. Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.” It’s a common refrain among crypto firms who find themselves under scrutiny. But federal authorities have made clear that they’re not going to pull any punches when it comes to corporate crime, in crypto or elsewhere. Analysts see the settlement as a partial victory for Binance and Zhao. “The avoidance of prison time for CZ and the ability for the exchange to continue operations, albeit without CZ as its CEO, is likely the best outcome given the severity of the accusations against Binance,” said Robert Le, crypto analyst for PitchBook. “Binance’s initial ‘move fast and break things’ approach, which involved offering products that were illegal or entering markets without proper licenses, has led to its current predicament.” The initial market response to the Binance news was muted, with Bitcoin slipping just over 1% Tuesday afternoon — hardly a blip in the notoriously volatile market. Investors and entrepreneurs in the crypto space just want to see the industry move on from its early days of idolizing founders. “The question really is whether or not crypto is actually growing up in a way that is allowing it to have an existence beyond its influential founders who have been shepherding the brand, shepherding the innovation, shepherding the advocacy for these institutions,” said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert on financial regulation. “That’s something that will have to be seen over the next couple of months.” Yadav notes that the $4.3 billion deal for Binance reflects its status as a systemically important institution — potentially too big to fail. “What this plea deal does is give Binance as a chance to live another day,” Yadav said. “I think that reflects a worry that if Binance were to be killed, that would cause further damage to average folks who hold money on it to the industry as a whole.”",Business
Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda," A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group. More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino. Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both Premium and regular accounts.” One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100 million times globally. “Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year, it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.” X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawmakers’ accusations. On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.” The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content. Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment. Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own policies. It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6 hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure from typical practice.”",Business
"Paris Hilton’s media company suspends ads on X, one month after agreeing to touted partnership with the platform"," Paris Hilton’s entertainment company 11:11 Media has pulled an advertising campaign from Elon Musk’s X just one month after announcing an exclusive partnership with the platform, becoming the latest brand to halt ad spending on the site formerly known as Twitter over concerns about antisemitism and pro-Nazi content on the site. “11:11 Media made the decision to immediately pull the campaign from the platform,” Bruce Gersh, 11:11 Media’s president and chief operating officer, told CNN on Tuesday. The decision by Hilton’s company to pull its advertising is a blow to X and the platform’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, who announced a major promotional partnership with Hilton just last month. The deal, which was touted by Yaccarino as a long-term, “official partnership” between Hilton, 11:11 Media, and X, aimed to create “a launchpad for new initiatives in video and live video, live commerce, Spaces, and so much more.” The deal also established a revenue-sharing agreement between the parties. Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal advertising chief who has been tasked with wooing wary advertisers back to X despite Musk’s tumultuous leadership, declared Hilton the “queen of pop culture” and described the partnership as “a new era” that would reside exclusively on X. A spokesperson for Hilton declined to comment on whether the suspension of 11:11’s ad campaign also meant the end of Hilton’s partnership with X. A spokesperson for X also did not immediately respond. Hilton remains active on the platform via her personal account, @ParisHilton, where she has amassed 16.6 million followers. The decision by 11:11 Media to pull its advertising campaign from X comes after at least half a dozen brands also paused their ad spending on X last week over concerns about pro-Nazi content and Musk’s embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on the platform. IBM halted its ad spend on X on Thursday after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters showed its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on X. Other major brands, including Disney and Paramount, followed suit on Friday, but did not specify their reasoning for pulling their ad spending from X.",Business
CEO of world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange pleads guilty to money laundering violations," Billionaire Changpeng Zhao and leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance pleaded guilty on Tuesday to federal charges in a watershed moment designed to bring order to the often-lawless crypto industry. As part of a coordinated settlement across the federal government, Binance has agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other penalties. Zhao, one of the most powerful figures in crypto, has agreed to step down as CEO from the exchange that he founded, and he will pay $200 million in fines. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations. US officials described this as the biggest-ever corporate resolution that includes criminal charges for an executive. Following a years-long investigation, authorities allege Binance allowed bad actors to freely transact on the platform, enabling everything from child sex abuse and narcotics to terrorist financing for ISIS, Al Qaeda and Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades. Zhao, who has amassed a fortune estimated at more than $23 billion, pled guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. US authorities hope the guilty plea from Binance and its founder, on top of the recent conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, will send a clear message to bad actors across the crypto industry. “Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Zhao faces a maximum of 10 years behind bars, though his ultimate sentence will likely be far lower. Federal guidelines likely place the high end of a possible sentence for Zhao around 18 months. Sentencing is ultimately decided by a judge. According to the plea deal, Zhao agreed to prosecutors’ recommendation that he pay a fine of $50 million. In addition to the criminal fine, Zhao will pay $150 million in civil penalties, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The proposed consent order also requires Binance to disgorge $1.35 billion of ill-gotten gains and pay a $1.35 billion civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. “Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profits,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers through its platform.” The Binance guilty plea is part of a coordinated settlement reached with a wide range of government agencies, including the Justice Department, Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Treasury described the Binance settlement as its largest enforcement in history. “The Binance platform was facilitating some truly horrible stuff – everything from terrorist financing to ransomware actions, child pornography and various scams and frauds,” a senior Treasury official told reporters. US officials say Binance allowed more than 100,000 transactions involving illicit activity as well as more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated US sanctions, including sanctions on Iran, Syria and Cuba. Just as authorities announced the settlement, Zhao confirmed in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he has stepped down as CEO. “Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do,” Zhao said. “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibilities. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.” Zhao will be succeeded by Richard Teng, who previously served as Binance’s global head of regional markets. “While Binance is not perfect, it has strived to protect users since its early days as a small startup and has made tremendous efforts to invest in security and compliance,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Binance grew at an extremely fast pace globally… [and] made misguided decisions along the way. Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.” Federal prosecutors unsealed court records on Tuesday alleging Binance, led by Zhao, processed transactions by customers who operated illicit mixing services and “laundered proceeds of darknet market transactions, hacks, ransomware and scams.” Prosecutors allege that Binance had lax anti-money laundering procedures. This alleged misconduct paved the way for Binance to become king of the crypto exchanges, prosecutors allege. “In part because of this scheme, and because Defendant prioritized growth, market share and profits over compliance with US law (Binance) became the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” prosecutors said. Prosecutors allege Binance, “knowingly failed” to register as a money service business, willfully violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and willfully caused violations of US economic sanctions. The charges, filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, accused Binance of a “deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the US market without implementing controls required by US laws.” Prosecutors allege the misconduct started as early as August 2017, continued until at least October 2022 and included certain Binance officers, directors, employees and agents. As Garland detailed the federal government’s investigation into Binance, he mentioned a message that one compliance employee sent in February 2019 that said the crypto exchange oughta get a banner that says: “Is washing drug money too hard these days? Come to Binance, we got cake for you.” “By failing to comply with US law, Binance made it easy for criminals to move their stolen funds and illicit proceeds on its exchanges,” Garland said. Proponents of digital currencies point out that the great majority of business done via crypto is lawful and legitimate, and a cottage industry of companies have emerged in the last five years that work with law enforcement to track digital transactions. But top US officials made it crystal clear Wednesday that they’ll continue to keep a close eye on illicit activities surrounding crypto. “Today’s actions show that if you serve US customers, you must comply with US law,” said Nicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general. “US financial institutions are the gatekeepers for the safety and security of our financial system and because Binance serves a substantial amount of US customers, it was a US financial institution that was required to comply with anti-money laundering laws.” Binance’s legal woes follow the collapse of another crypto exchange, FTX, and the conviction of it founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. Those are the most extreme examples of the greater scrutiny that law enforcement and regulators have brought in recent months to the largely unregulated crypto industry. But ransomware gangs from Russia and money launderers from North Korea, for example, continue to see crypto as core to their business model, and have often used publicly available tools, or “mixing services,” to hide their ill-gotten gains. The US Justice Department in August unsealed federal charges against the co-founders of one such service, Tornado Cash, accusing them of moving $1 billion in cryptocurrency for criminals. One of the Tornado Cash co-founders has pleaded not guilty to the charges while the other remains at large. Officials said they are taking an aggressive, whole-of-government approach to rooting out financial crimes via crypto. “You have seen both in our actions today and in prior cases that we will be relentless in using every tool that we currently have to deploy against those who seek to use technologies in a way that abuse those platforms … or [that] don’t prevent the use of those platforms for illicit activities,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said. Monaco pointed to the creation of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team within the Justice Department as an example that the feds mean business, including how government entities collaborate on investigating crimes involving crypto. Some think more needs to be done. “Regrettably, today’s settlement is not an outlier, and the lawlessness if not criminal activities of crypto will continue and increase until all prosecutors, regulators and elected officials force the industry to act like all other law-abiding people and firms in the financial industry,” Dennis Kelleher, co-founder, president, and CEO of Better Markets, said in a statement. Binance was founded in 2017 by Zhao, a Canadian national. US market regulators this year brought civil cases against Binance, which they accuse of running an illegal exchange for unregistered securities in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission in June sued Binance, saying the company ran an “extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.” Binance has long argued that it isn’t subject to US laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in America. The SEC also alleged that Zhao and Binance commingled customer assets and even diverted some to an entity controlled by Zhao. Zhao claims that the company’s headquarters are wherever he is at any point in time, “reflecting a deliberate approach to attempt to avoid regulation,” according to a complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That agency accused Binance and Zhao of violating US derivatives trading laws in multiple ways, including allegedly secretly coaching “VIP” customers within the United States on how to evade compliance controls. A spokesperson for Binance said in June that the company takes the SEC’s allegations seriously, but it believes the agency’s accusations are “unjustified.” “We respectfully disagree with the SEC’s allegations that Binance operated as an unregistered securities exchange or illegally offered and sold securities,” the company said in a statement. “Because of our size and global name recognition, Binance has found itself an easy target caught in the middle of a US regulatory tug-of-war.” This story has been updated with additional developments.",Business
OpenAI’s turmoil is about more than Sam Altman," The battle over the most consequential technology in decades is getting ugly, fast. OpenAI’s incredible upheaval — with former CEO Sam Altman caught in the middle — could have broad implications for who gets to control the future of artificial intelligence. A year ago, OpenAI was an obscure startup that unleashed a technology so powerful, it almost immediately invited comparisons to Prometheus bringing fire down from the realm of the gods. ChatGPT — the impressively human-sounding artificial intelligence tool — and the scrappy nonprofit that built it, quickly became synonymous with the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence. Now, just 12 months later, a disastrous boardroom shakeup has upended the power balance in the industry. With OpenAI facing a potential mutiny, it’s Microsoft — the 50-year-old behemoth best known for stodgy office work software like Excel and PowerPoint — that finds itself suddenly at the cutting edge of the most significant technological innovation in decades. Microsoft announced that Altman and several other key members of OpenAI would join the company to help with its artificial intelligence innovation. Its plan to integrate the ChatGPT braintrust under its own brand could turbo-charge the expansion of AI-powered tools, potentially realizing the worst fears of the OpenAI founders who feared the dangerous-in-the-wrong-hands technology could be rolled out too quickly in the effort to turn a profit. In short: The OpenAI board abruptly fired its CEO and co-founder, Sam Altman, on Friday, setting off a chaotic weekend in which the board tried and failed to undo the decision. Within 48 hours, Microsoft had announced that it had tapped Altman to lead a new in-house AI group. The anger within OpenAI spilled over on Monday, more than 500 of its employees threatened to quit unless they get Altman back and the current board resigns. The news that Altman and another OpenAI co-founder, Greg Brockman, would defect drove Microsoft’s shares to a record high on Monday. On Monday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella conceded in interviews with CNBC and CNN contributor Kara Swisher on her podcast, “On with Kara Swisher,” that the battle over Altman is not yet over. He acknowledged Altman may ultimately return to lead OpenAI if the hundreds of employees who threatened to resign are successful in their attempt to lure him back. However, Microsoft has already won the war: It is OpenAI’s most important stakeholder, with a promised $13 billion investment. That means Nadella and Co. get Altman either way: They can have their AI cake and eat it, too. “All those VCs and sovereign wealth funds would have lined up to give Altman whatever money he needed to do whatever thing he wanted to,” said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. “And now they can’t access that … the only thing they can do is invest in Microsoft.” Altman is the AI date everyone wants to bring to the prom. In the past year, he has become the public face of the industry, and was instrumental in forging OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft, which began in 2019. And last year, he introduced ChatGPT to the world, a technology that has become synonymous with AI and made its promise real and tangible to millions of people who had no idea software was capable of approximating something this … human. But Altman is not the ultimate prize: Leadership in the artificial intelligence space is. The technology is either being used or has broad implications to shakeup every industry: from driverless cars, to finance, to the classroom, to journalism – even art and music. And Microsoft has an enormous leg up over the competition. Nothing is guaranteed, but its relationship with Altman and OpenAI has put Microsoft in the pole position. The relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has been beneficial for both companies. OpenAI relies heavily on Microsoft’s cloud computing infrastructure, Azure. And Microsoft’s association with the hottest startup in Silicon Valley has helped restore its image among developers. If Altman ultimate joins Microsoft, it “will be able to harness a lot of the progress that was made at OpenAI more directly rather than at arms-length,” said Gil Luria, managing director and senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. “[Microsoft] now controls the team that has made this remarkable progress, which puts them in a position to control the development path for this technology for the next several years.” The future of OpenAI has many tech startups in the AI space scrambling to figure out what happens next: OpenAI’s technology has become the standard for developers, Luria said, and Microsoft will be trying to maintain that standard rather than cede ground to rivals at Google or Anthropic. “When you use the OpenAI standards, you’re using Azure,” he said. “The biggest benefit to Microsoft from this OpenAI relationship was reinvigorating growth at Azure.” In hiring Altman to lead an in-house AI team, Microsoft is counting on the founder’s magnetism to attract talent and money from investors, and smooth over regulatory hurdles that could snare the rollout of AI-powered tools. OpenAI’s board has made only vague public statements about the reason for firing Altman, saying that he was “not consistently candid in his communications with the board.” But several people told CNN contributor Kara Swisher that a key factor in the decision was a disagreement about how quickly to bring AI to the market. Altman, sources say, wanted to move quickly, while the OpenAI board wanted to move more cautiously. “The OpenAI debacle is the result of a tension between people who believe that AI discoveries are safe enough, and should be pursued rapidly right now, versus people who believe AI discoveries … should be tempered with some discernment about what the potential cost could be of releasing them,” Schloetzer said. Altman has been one of the loudest voices pleading for regulation. At the same time, he has been one of the fastest movers, turning the profitable arm of OpenAI into a $90 billion company practically overnight. Both achievements are possible, and OpenAI’s strange structure — a nonprofit overseeing a for-profit company — was designed to contain AI from destroying humanity. Yet the soap opera at OpenAI threatens to upset that balance. Soon, we may need to rely on Microsoft, one of the biggest, most powerful companies in the world, to ensure that AI is used for good and not evil. — CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this article.",Business
Honda’s new scooter is also the box it comes in," There are lots of electric scooters available today in a huge range of styles and prices. But none of them look like the new Honda Motocompacto. Honda seemingly took design inspiration from Ikea furniture while it’s still in the box. The Motocompacto’s seat, back wheel and handle bars fold neatly into its body, a flat off-white rectangle designed to slide easily into the cargo compartment of a small SUV like, say, a Honda HR-V. It will fit into other vehicles, as well, but the Motocompacto will be sold by Honda dealers. The real inspiration was the Honda Motocompo, a tiny motorcycle Honda offered for a few years in the early 1980s. The gas-powered Motocompo folded up into a small red rectangle that fit easily into the back of a Honda City, a teeny hatchback car that, like the Motocompo, was never sold in the United States. It was intended as sort of an offshoot of the car. Once you parked your City, you could slide out the Motocompo and buzz along to your final destination. The Motocompo tied together Honda’s two worlds of cars and motorcycles. Honda prides itself on having been a wide-ranging “transportation provider” long before that became trendy industry-speak. Honda started as a motorcycle company, and still makes those, plus scooters, sedans, SUVs, a midsize pickup, riding mowers, and a jet airplane. Despite selling relatively few Motocompo bikes for a few years and never bringing them to the US, the Motocompo has become a trendy collectible here, selling for as much as $10,000 today. Its memory inspired someone in Honda’s California design studio –- someone Honda won’t name because he’s left the company –- to sketch out a modern version. In the age of lithium ion batteries, making a compact foldable bike is much easier than it was in 1981. In fact, it’s so easy and it’s been done so often it raises the question of “Why bother?” Why does the world need another compact foldable electric bike? You could just as well ask “Why does the world need another cute, fuzzy kitten?” Because it’s adorable, that’s why. The Motocompacto also has certain advantages. There’s the fact that, when folded up, its slab of a body keeps most of the metal parts and cables that could catch on things neatly stored as if in, yes, a box. Only a portion of the wheels remains exposed, just enough so you can roll it toward an outlet for charging. (At just over 41 pounds, it’s liftable but not exactly light.) It rides pretty nicely. Once you get the hang of it, which took me only a few minutes –- and I hadn’t ridden a scooter in ages -– it was a lot of fun. Honda’s designers and engineers spent a lot of time, I was told, on getting the angle of the handle bars and the position of the seat and footpegs just right so it doesn’t feel jittery. For beginners, a setting limits speed to 10 mph but, even when you open it all the way up, the top speed is still only 15 mph. So it’s not super fast, and it doesn’t go very far on a charge. Twelve miles, though, is probably farther than you’d want to go, or else you’d just drive the car it fits into. As you’d expect on a box with small wheels and hard tires, the ride is pretty firm but, on a bike path along the Hudson River, the trip was smooth. It’s easily maneuverable and the speed comes on nice and smoothly using a lever on the handle bar. As little electric scooters go, it’s a luxury buy. Prices start at $995. You can get seated scooters for less, but they wont look like the Motocompo or be as cleverly self-packaged. Also, they won’t be Hondas, which should give you confidence in its quality. Also giving you confidence will be the seriously sturdy latches locking the seat, handle bars and wheels in place before you start riding. Plus, sensors prevent the bike from turning on unless everything is properly secured. For now, there are no color choices. Its buff-colored body comes with a brown leather seat and handlebar grips. Those flat white sides are screaming for decals, though. And your Honda dealer will be happy to sell those to you. as well.",Business
Can Argentina really move from the peso to the dollar?," Javier Milei won Argentina’s presidential election Sunday on a ticket to overhaul South America’s No. 2 economy and ditch its peso currency in favor of the US dollar. Will the Libertarian’s radical plans see the light of day? Milei’s La Libertad Avanza coalition won the election with nearly 56% of the vote, defeating the incumbent center-left Peronist party and its candidate, economy minister Sergio Massa. In his victory speech Sunday, Milei provided few details of the economic policies he plans to adopt when he takes office on December 10. But the self-declared “anarcho-capitalist”— who wielded a chainsaw on the campaign trail to symbolize his plans to cut state spending — promised “drastic” reforms. “The model of decadence has come to an end, there’s no going back,” Milei declared. “Today we end the destructive model of the ever-present state, it only benefits a few while the majority of Argentina suffers,” he added, while also acknowledging the challenges facing him. “We have monumental problems ahead of us: inflation, economic stagnation, lack of genuine employment, insecurity, poverty and indigence.” Financial markets broadly welcomed Milei’s victory, which is likely to usher in a sea change in economic policymaking. Milei must tackle inflation above 140%, a shortfall in foreign currency reserves and the prospect of another painful recession. Argentina’s dollar bonds rose Monday, while the New York-listed shares of several Argentine companies surged. State-owned energy company YPF (YPF) jumped 40%, and banks Banco Macro (BMA) and Grupo Financiero Galicia (GGAL) gained 20%. Argentina’s financial markets are closed for a local holiday, but the peso weakened slightly in partial trade to stand at around 353.58 to the US dollar. The value of the currency has plunged 875% to the dollar over the past five years. Milei has pledged to remove currency controls and import restrictions, which analysts say would result in even more pressure on the peso, taking the value of the currency closer to the levels at which it trades on various informal markets. Bruno Gennari, Argentina expert at fixed income broker dealer KNG Securities, said the peso was trading at $1,009 versus the dollar on crypto exchanges Monday, considerably weaker than the $869 and $975 rates seen on Friday. A former economist and TV pundit who ran for president on a promise to “break the status quo,” Milei made “dollarizing” Argentina a signature campaign promise, hailing it as a cure for the country’s hyperinflation problem. It’s a step that other countries have taken, just none the size of Argentina — Latin America’s third-biggest economy after Brazil and Mexico. Dollarization means Argentina would give up the peso and use the US dollar as its currency, effectively wresting control of monetary policy from the country’s central bank and handing it to the US Federal Reserve. The move would also deprive Argentina’s central bank of the ability to print money — a tactic it has frequently employed to help the country’s spendthrift government avoid defaulting on its debts. That, in turn, fueled rampant price rises. Analysts agree dollarization would help tame inflation. But they doubt Milei has the political or popular support to deliver on this agenda. “We suspect that some of his more radical proposals — namely dollarization — may not materialize, given limited support both in congress and among the public,” William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Monday. While dollarization “would be a surefire way to bring inflation under control, it wouldn’t be a solution to the country’s fiscal woes,” he added. In a sign he may be seeking to gain support from centrist parties, Milei did not mention dollarization or previously mooted plans to shut down the central bank in his victory speech. “It’s not going to happen in the near term,” said Thierry Larose, a portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. Quite apart from the political hurdles, the fragile state of Argentina’s economy leaves it in no position to dollarize, he told CNN, describing it as a “terrible idea.” That’s because as things currently stand, the conversion rate would be highly unfavorable to the peso, drastically weakening the currency and likely leading to an increase in poverty, which government figures already put at around 40%. “If you want to dollarize at (a) conversion rate that makes sense from a social and economic perspective, you need a minimal amount of international reserves,” Larose said. Currently, the government’s foreign exchange reserves are more than $10 billion in the red. The “path towards dollarization,” however, could benefit the economy, Larose added. “In order to dollarize … you need to stabilize (the economy): kill hyperinflation, rebuild foreign exchange reserves,” he said. “You need fiscal consolidation and eventually you need access to capital markets.” That could still be some way off. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has effectively barred Argentina from accessing international markets while the country pays back its debts. Argentina owes the Washington, DC-based lender some $44 billion following a historic bailout in 2018. Kristalina Georgieva, the fund’s managing director, congratulated Milei on his election victory Monday. “We look forward to working closely with him and his administration in the period ahead to develop and implement a strong plan to safeguard macroeconomic stability and strengthen inclusive growth for all Argentinians,” she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Milei will need all the help he can get. The World Bank expects the Argentine economy to contract by 2.5% in 2023, owing in part to a devastating drought that is estimated to cost it $20 billion in lost agricultural exports. What’s more, Jackson, of Capital Economics, expects the IMF to “shift away” from its recent leniency toward Argentina. “It’s not clear if a debt restructuring will be demanded at this point, but we are moving in that direction,” he said. — Valentina Gonzalez, Stefano Pozzebon, Olesya Dmitracova and Reuters contributed reporting.",Business
Tesla shareholder calls on board to suspend Elon Musk for agreeing with antisemitic post," Tesla’s board of directors should suspend Elon Musk for endorsing antisemitic views on social media, according to an investor in the electric vehicle company and a leading management expert. Jerry Braakman, president of First American Trust, wants Tesla’s board to send a clear message that Musk went too far last week by agreeing with an antisemitic post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that claims Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.” “I believe in free speech, but there’s no excuse for spreading hatred by a CEO of a public company,” Braakman said in a statement. On Friday, Disney, NBCUniversal, CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery and other major brands halted advertising on X, which is owned by Musk. The companies did not specifically say it was related to Musk’s post, but some of their advertisements were found to be placed near antisemitic posts on X, according to a report by Media Matters. Tesla’s board should put Musk on leave for 30 to 60 days and require him to attend empathy training and/or therapy, Braakman argued. “Neither his wealth nor his technical and business prowess excuse his statements. It seems it has only amplified the demons he carries. And it screams that he needs help,” Braakman said. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, agrees that Tesla’s board should hold Musk responsible. “The board has a responsibility to act. He should not be able to use the title of chief executive officer. That should be suspended right away,” Sonnenfeld told CNN on Monday. The Yale professor said if Musk served as chief technology officer instead of CEO, the share price impact should not be meaningful. Neither Tesla nor the company’s chair, Robyn Denholm, responded to requests for comment. Of course, Musk holds enormous sway over Tesla, which he co-founded. Not only is Musk viewed as the single most important person at Tesla, but he sits on the board of directors and is the largest individual shareholder. Musk held 411 million shares as of the end of March, amounting to about a 13% stake valued today at approximately $96 billion. By contrast, Santa Ana, Calif.-based First American owns a relatively tiny stake of 16,000 shares as of the end of September. Tesla board is led by Denholm and includes James Murdoch, venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis, Musk’s younger brother Kimbal and Musk himself. “Only his board can hold him accountable. And he has a lot of friends on it,” Braakman said. Nell Minow, a Tesla shareholder and vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises institutional investors on corporate governance matters, said Tesla’s board should hire a firm to evaluate the impact on the car company’s brand from Musk’s “terrible behavior.” “I had been thinking about buying a Tesla but that’s off the table now. I just don’t want to support him,” Minow told CNN. Minow said she has “no confidence whatsoever” in the willingness of Tesla’s board to provide meaningful oversight over Musk. “The board has plenty of reason to replace him as CEO. But do they have the ability to do it? Do they have the courage to do it? The answer is no,” Minow told CNN. “I am as concerned, as a Jewish person, with his instability as I am with his antisemitism.” Another shareholder, Ross Gerber, CEO and president of Gerber Kawasaki, told CNBC late last week that Musk’s behavior is “absolutely outrageous” and is “destroying the brand.” “I’ve just never had this with any company I’ve ever invested in, ever in my life,” Gerber said. Some prominent business leaders are standing by Musk. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who has been critical of how Harvard and other universities have handled antisemitism on campus, said over the weekend that Musk is “not an antisemite.” “It is remarkable how quickly the world stands ready to attack Musk for his shoot from the hip commentary,” Ackman said in a post on X. “Musk is not perfect, but the world is a vastly better place because of him.”",Business
Prices for a set of Messi’s World Cup jerseys could exceed a record $10 million," Soccer superstar Lionel Messi is no stranger to breaking records, and he’s about to possibly add another to his list. A set of six jerseys that he wore during last year’s World Cup, which his home country of Argentina won, are being put up for auction by Sotheby’s next week. Specifically, the jerseys were worn by the Argentine captain during each stage of the month-long tournament, including the massive final against France. The auction house expects bids to be in excess of $10 million, with the sale poised to becoming one of the “most valuable collection of sports memorabilia at auction,” it said. If achieved, the price for the set would surpass a jersey worn by Michael Jordan in Game 1 of the 1998 NBA Final from his famous “Last Dance” season, which sold for $10.1 million at Sotheby’s last year. That shirt currently holds the world record title of being the “most valuable item of sports memorabilia ever sold at auction,” according to the auction house. The current record for a match-worn item of soccer memorabilia is held by legend Diego Maradona and his “Hand of God” shirt that Sotheby’s sold for $9.3 million last year. Bids were initially expected to range from $5 million to $7 million, perhaps signaling that Messi’s jersey prices could go higher. “The sale of these six shirts stands as a monumental occasion in auction history, offering fans and collectors a connection to Messi’s crowning achievement,” said Brahm Wachter, head of modern collectibles for Sotheby’s, in a release. “It is an honor for Sotheby’s to present and exhibit these invaluable collectables to the public, which encapsulate the sheer brilliance of a player who has redefined the boundaries of football excellence.” To date, the most expensive match-worn Messi jersey sold at auction was for $450,000 last year, which he wore during the 2017 El Clásico, a tense battle between his former team of FC Barcelona against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Real Madrid. Messi’s last-minute goal, the 500th of his career, was the match winner. The online auction for Messi’s jerseys runs from November 30 to December 14 and will be displayed during that time in a free exhibition at Sotheby’s gallery in New York. Sotheby’s added that the Messi auction comes during a “vigorous market for sports memorabilia and collectibles, fueled by the property and unique experiences it offers.” Similar auctions, including jerseys from NFL great Tom Brady and the late NBA player Kobe Bryant, are luring in younger bidders too, half of them being under 40 years old, with more than half entirely new to its sales, the company said. Messi, 36, joined MLS team Inter Miami earlier this year, ending a roughly two-decade long stint playing for European teams, notably Barcelona and most recently Paris Saint-Germain. His appearances sent MLS ticket prices skyrocketing and fans had trouble getting their hands on replica jerseys for several months. Last year in Qatar, Messi helped his country of Argentina win its third FIFA World Cup title (and his first) by beating France via a penalty shootout in one of the most thrilling finals in tournament history. Adidas said that his jerseys and Argentina team kits quickly sold out.",Business
Average 401(k) account balance fell in the third quarter — but it’s still up double digits from a year ago," Given that the S&P 500 fell 3.7% in the third quarter of this year, it’s not surprising that 401(k) account balances followed suit. The average 401(k) balance was down 4% from the second quarter, but is still up 11% from a year ago and up 27% over the past decade, according to a new analysis from Fidelity Investments, one of the largest US providers of workplace retirement plans. What’s more, savings rates remained strong. Including both their own and their employers’ contributions, 401(k) participants were saving an average of 13.9% of their income, up slightly from a year ago, Fidelity said. Baby Boomers who are still in the workforce were socking away the most, at an average of 16.7%. Nevertheless, more people took money out of their 401(k) plan last quarter, indicating financial strain. Fidelity found that 2.3% of workers took hardship withdrawals, up from 1.8% a year ago. The top reasons cited: Avoiding foreclosure or eviction; and medical costs. Withdrawals from one’s 401(k) are subject to income tax. And if they are made before age 59-1/2 they also may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless the money is intended to meet an immediate financial need that is considered a “hardship,” such as medical expenses or efforts to avoid losing one’s home. By contrast, so-called in-service withdrawals — which are for expenses not deemed hardships and for which a person is willing to pay the tax and penalty — also rose in the third quarter to 3.2%, up from 2.7% from a year ago. They are subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty if taken before age 59-1/2. Meanwhile, the percentage of participants taking loans from their 401(k)s also ticked up in the third quarter, increasing to 2.8% from 2.4% in the same quarter last year. Inflation and cost-of-living pressures may account for that increase in loans, according to Fidelity. Altogether, the percent of outstanding 401(k) loans stood at 17.6% versus 17.2% in the second quarter. The all-time low in outstanding loans — 16.6% — was reached in early 2022. Loans — which in most instances can’t exceed 50% of one’s vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less — typically must be paid back with interest within five years and payments must be made on at least a quarterly basis. Overall, Fidelity said, “The increasing use of hardship withdrawals and loans underscore the need to help retirement savers develop emergency savings, which Fidelity has found to be the No. 1 savings goal among employees, after retirement.” It noted that many leading employers are now working with Fidelity to add workplace emergency savings programs as a benefit.",Business
Sam Altman is back at OpenAI … with a guest badge," Sam Altman is back at OpenAI. Well… he’s back at the OpenAI headquarters in San Francisco, anyway. Whether or not he returns as CEO of the ChatGPT parent company is still up in the air. Posting on X a photo of himself Sunday holding a green guest badge connected to a lanyard labeled “OpenAI,” the just-ousted CEO wrote: “first and last time i ever wear one of these.” Altman didn’t say why he was at OpenAI’s office Sunday, but multiple news reports, including the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, said that the board that fired him has had second thoughts and has engaged with him and Greg Brockman, the company’s co-founder and former president, for a return. Brockman resigned Friday moments after the company showed Altman the door. It was unclear until Sunday whether Altman would consider a comeback just days after being ousted. But his appearance at OpenAI suggests he is at least mulling a return. Still, negotiations between the board and Altman haven’t yielded any results as of yet, and it’s not clear that Altman will accept the board’s offer to return. He may impose conditions, according to multiple news reports, including insisting that Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor, take a seat on the board. He also reportedly wants to add other allies as directors. OpenAI’s inexperienced board is down to just four members after Altman and Brockman left the company: Ilya Sutskever, the company’s chief scientist; Adam D’Angelo, the founder of Quora; Tasha McCauley, CEO of 3D modeling company GeoSim Systems; and Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. The board had said Friday Altman “was not consistently candid in his communications” with them, an opaque phrase that left much to the imagination. Brockman said Friday in a post on X that the board gave Altman and other strategic partners virtually no heads up about the decision. That reportedly included Microsoft, which does not hold a board seat – but does have $13 billion invested in the company. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) fell after Altman’s ouster Friday, and the company’s leadership probably wants the wunderkind leader of its most promising (and very expensive) investment back at the helm before the market opens Monday. The company is a nonprofit. But Altman, Brockman and Sutskever in 2019 formed OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity that exists within the larger company’s structure. That for-profit company took OpenAI from worthless to a valuation of $90 billion in just a few years – and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to the company’s success. Altman had pushed the for-profit company to innovate faster and go to market with products. That reportedly scared the company’s board, which remained majority controlled by the nonprofit wing of the company. CNN contributor Kara Swisher reported that OpenAI’s recent developer conference served as an inflection point: Altman announced that OpenAI would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. If Altman gets his wishes and returns to OpenAI, the company could look quite different than it does today, with a board more focused on profitability and growth – like most Silicon Valley startups. If not, Altman reportedly may opt for another venture, perhaps taking loyalists away from OpenAI to his new landing spot. Either way, OpenAI’s board made a consequential decision that will make massive waves in the AI industry for years to come.",Business
Argentina election: Milei’s victory puts the peso’s future in doubt," Libertarian Javier Milei’s victory Sunday in Argentina’s presidential run-off contest has far-reaching consequences for the country’s struggling economy, including the fate of the peso. A political outsider who ran on a promise to “break the status quo,” Milei’s economic platform rested on a desire to dollarize the Argentinian economy. Dollarization means the country would give up the Argentine peso and use the US dollar as its currency. If enacted, the policy would hurl the nation into unknown territory: No country of Argentina’s size has previously turned over the reins of its own monetary policy to Washington decisionmakers. Ecuador and El Salvador have also dollarized their economies to combat inflation. Argentina has one of the world’s highest inflation rates; data released last week showed that prices rose 142% year-over-year. Milei’s proposal to switch Argentina’s currency from the peso to the US dollar rests on the argument that the dollar is stronger than the peso and, unlike the peso, cannot be printed at will. His vision has drawn international attention and a number of warnings from critics, who refer to the move as a straightjacket, saying that dollarization results in a country losing autonomy to influence the economy through monetary policy moves such as interest rate changes. Sergio Massa, the country’s current economy minister and Milei’s run-off opponent, had criticized the plan for dollarization as a surrender of national sovereignty. Proponents of the plan, including analysts from the Cato Institute, a libertarian economic think tank based in Washington, DC, favor the move as a practical strategy to tame what has been a decades-long problem.

From Sin City to Sports Central: How Las Vegas is betting big on a lucrative industry," When Formula 1 racecars rip along the iconic Las Vegas Strip this Sunday, it will serve as another highly visible reminder of a significant shift in the city’s economy. In under a decade’s time, the desert city long known for its casinos, food and live entertainment has become the home to four major league sports teams (the latest being MLB’s Athletics), six minor league teams, a major sports organization in the Ultimate Fighting Champion, and four large sports venues playing host to events such as NCAA tournament games, NFL Pro Bowls, and, coming this February, Super Bowl LVIII. At least a half-dozen more venues are in the planning stages, and the city appears poised to be one of the top picks for an NBA expansion team and an MLS team, as well. “Ten years ago, leagues didn’t even want to look at us twice,” said Andrew Woods, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Now it feels like we’re the belle of the ball.” Las Vegas a sports metropolis? It’s a potentially lucrative development that could spell expansion and a broader economic base for the city; however, it comes with growing pains. The initial economic impact estimates for Sunday’s Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix and the February 2024 Super Bowl were $1.3 billion, and $500 million, respectively. (But this was before ticket prices slid for F1 when the championship was won earlier in the season). That total would match the estimated $1.8 billion contributed to the metro area by all sporting events from July 2021 to June 2022, according to an economic impact study released this summer by the Center for Business and Economic Research at UNLV’s Lee Business School. With bigger events, however, come bigger challenges. Construction and preparation for the F1 race gnarled traffic, agitating locals in the process. Also drawing the ire of longtime residents and visitors are the (initially) exorbitant prices and the potentially blocked views of everything from the Bellagio fountains to the Mirage volcano, due to the temporary grandstand and signage. “There are questions about do we have adequate infrastructure that can handle bigger and bigger events,” Woods said. “How do we make this beneficial for both a community that could soon have 3 million residents and have 50 million visitors a year and make that work for everyone?” And initially, it doesn’t appear that all are benefitting equally from the double-down on sports. In reviewing the intensity of sports in the Las Vegas area, Woods and his team noticed a troubling trend: “sports deserts,” a lack of access to facilities. Some communities, especially those that have been underserved in the past, might not have the same access to parks, local sports businesses and facilities, they found. Woods said more research needs to be done to confirm the initial findings. Sports have been deeply engrained in Las Vegas for decades, going back to the boxing heyday of the 1950s and 1960s and the rise of sports betting. Super Bowl Sundays and March Madness tournaments typically bring packed casinos and sportsbooks. But for many decades, the NFL and other leagues opposed having sport franchises in Las Vegas, most likely due to the city’s deeply rooted gambling industry. At one point, the city couldn’t run a tourism ad during the Super Bowl. By 2017, the sentiment had started to shift — including among league commissioners like the NFL’s Roger Goodell — as the National Hockey League as well as the Oakland Raiders had plans to set up shop there. “I think society in general has a bit of a change with respect to gambling in general,” Goodell said during a March 2017 press conference. “Vegas is not the same city it was 10 or 20 years ago. It is a much more diverse city, it has become an entertainment mecca.” He added: “They made a very compelling proposal, which the ownership obviously approved overwhelmingly.” Then came the 2018 ruling from the Supreme Court striking down a federal law that prohibited commercial sports betting in most states. As sports betting exploded into people’s living rooms, Vegas remained at the center of that digital industry — being home to the casino operators that backed those sportsbooks and online gambling companies such as FanDuel. The rise of sports betting and continued explosion in fantasy football created additional interest in sports and, in turn, back in Vegas, said Steve Hill, chief executive officer of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. “Vegas fans tend to be sports fans, too, and sports have helped us expand the customer base that are willing to consider Las Vegas,” Hill said. Last year, 6% of surveyed visitors attended a sporting event, up from 3% in 2019, and 4% of visitors said sporting events were the primary reason for a Vegas trip, according to the LVCVA 2022 Las Vegas Visitor Profile Study. “I think the city and our businesses are taking a big bet that both these percentages are going to grow,” said Woods of UNLV, “that we could see those percentages double in the near-term here, in the next two, three, four years as we add more sporting events.” The city that billed itself as the “Entertainment Capital of the World” has now rebranded as the “Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World.” Sports are growing in Las Vegas, but leisure and hospitality remain the city’s bread and butter. In Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is located, one in four workers are in the leisure and hospitality sector, and $1 for every $3 are generated by those businesses, Woods said. And during the past two years, Las Vegas and other tourist-centric cities have benefitted from consumers’ post-pandemic splurges on experiences and travel versus goods. Nevada’s monthly gaming revenue this year outpaced pre-pandemic levels and notched a nominal record monthly high in July at $1.4 billion, according to Nevada Gaming Control Board data. Having that deep concentration in one industry can be positive when times are good, but if there’s an economic downswing, it can be devastating for a local economy. In April 2020, Covid-19 shutdowns resulted in unemployment spiking in Las Vegas to a startling 34%, as the metro area became the hardest-hit in the United States. “The Strip was shut down, and that’s where revenue for services is generated and it’s where the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people is generated, and it was awful and scary at the time,” Hill said. As the pandemic wore on, construction continued on expanding the Las Vegas Convention Center as well as the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium, among other projects. “The city continued to bet on itself,” Hill said. “And that really paid off.” Although the sports events industry is nested within the leisure and hospitality sector, there are some early indications that the investments could spur diversification of the regional economy, through the rise of ancillary businesses in areas such as services, marketing and medicine. The number of businesses in sports instruction has seen a 156% increase in the past 10 years, according to UNLV’s research. And youth sports participation, especially among girls and young women, has seen marked increases, according to the report. “Anytime you can broaden what drives the economy, it’s a stabilizing influence and maybe a growth influence, too,” Hill said. “When it comes to, particularly, team sports, it doesn’t matter what’s going on in the economy, you’re going to have those events, and it’s a reason for people to decide to come to Las Vegas.”",Business
Interest rates are high. These are the best places to park your cash," The Federal Reserve on Wednesday chose not to raise its key interest rate, the same decision it took following its September meeting, leaving its benchmark lending rate at its highest level in 22 years. Given that the Fed influences — directly or indirectly — interest rates on financial accounts and products throughout the US economy, savers and people with surplus cash still have many opportunities to get a far better return on their money than they’ve had in years — and even more importantly, a return that outpaces the latest readings on inflation. Here are low-risk options to get the best yield on funds you plan to use within two years, and also on cash you expect to need within the next two to five years. The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.59%, according to an October 31 survey from Bankrate. That average is kept low by a nearly zero APY at the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which were each offering rates of just 0.01%. But many online, FDIC-insured banks are offering well north of 5% on their high-yield savings accounts. Those accounts are a great place to deposit money that you will likely deploy within the next two years — to cover anything from a planned vacation or big purchase to an emergency expense or an unexpected change of circumstance like a job loss. While bank deposit account yields can change overnight, they have remained high for months and are likely to continue to do so. “In the last few months, the Fed has signaled that it intends to keep rates higher for longer. … Some banks have responded to this new ‘higher for longer’ expectation by offering promotional rate guarantees on their savings or money market accounts. In the guarantee, a competitive rate is guaranteed to last for several months on the savings or money market account,” said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. An online savings account is what certified financial planner Lazetta Rainey Braxton, co-CEO at 2050 Wealth Partners, calls your “cushion” account. She likes the word “cushion” because it describes the flexibility and options such an account gives you to handle both what you want to do in the near term and what you might need to do. Another way high-yield accounts can be useful, Braxton said, is to house money you’ll need to pay off a purchase for which you’ve secured a 0% financing deal for a limited period of time. In that case, you won’t owe interest on your purchase so long as you pay it off in full before the end of the promotion period, which can be anywhere from six to 24 months. In the meantime, the money can grow by 4% to 5% a year in your high-yield account. For your regular household bills, Braxton recommends keeping just enough cash to cover a month or two in a regular checking account for fastest access. “Not too much, because [those accounts] won’t yield much,” she said. You can always link your high-yield account to your checking account to transfer funds when needed — just know it may take up to 24 hours for the transferred money to show up in your checking account, Braxton noted. If you don’t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don’t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low- risk debt instruments. As of Oct 31, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.19%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp (SIPC), which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won’t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years are certificates of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That’s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but if you do you will forfeit at least some interest. As of November 1, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations of three months, six months, nine months, one year and 18 months were all yielding at least 5.5% . Say you invest $10,000 in a six-month CD with a 5.5% APY. At the end of that period, you’ll get your principal back plus nearly $274 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate’s CD calculator. If you put it in a one-year CD you’d earn $555 in interest, while an 18-month term will generate $844. If you don’t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank. Tumin said. For example, he noted, Citi came out with an 11-month CD Special with a rate of up to 5.65% APY. But he cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years are short-term Treasury bills, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.46% and 5.54% respectively on November 1, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.46% and 5.43%, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. If you’re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don’t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you’re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. Yields on four-year, AAA rated corporate bonds, for instance, were yielding 4.97% this week, and three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had rates of 4.59%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser — meaning someone who doesn’t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you’ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. “What happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner — or your parents need medical care fast?” Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don’t chase yield for yield’s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. “Most of the time convenience is really important.

To be sure, here’s nothing wrong with fantasizing about winning the grand prize, or dropping $5 to $10 to buy lottery tickets or scratch-offs on occasion. In fact, Americans spent nearly $108 billion on lottery tickets last year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. However, given everyone’s dreadfully poor odds of winning big — you have a better chance of being struck by lightning — spending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a year in hopes of becoming a fast millionaire is a little like setting your cash on fire. If your real goal is to improve your financial situation and enjoy your life more, here are a few easy ways to do that with the same amount of money you’d spend playing your numbers — but with a guaranteed return: Let’s be real. If you’re willing to spend hundreds of bucks on lottery tickets, scratch-offs and other games of chance, you may not be psyched to redirect that money into a retirement fund, since the payoff may be decades from now. If that’s the case for you, why not spend most of your lottery money on experiences you know you like doing now. “Simply enjoy the money. Put it in a ‘fun’ fund. To go out to a fancy dinner or go on a vacation,” said personal finance educator Tiffany Aliche, founder of TheBudgetnista.com and the Live Richer Academy. “If that money is going to be gone anyway, I’d rather you have lovely experiences. Let it be gone in a way that holistically enriches your life.” If you’re carrying credit card debt, one of the best ways to leave yourself with more money is to pay off, or at least substantially pay down, your highest-interest debt. And — reality check — all credit card debt is expensive today, since rates are at record highs. So, redirecting most of your lottery-spending dollars toward that end may improve your life markedly by relieving you of some financial strain. “You’ll have more money to spend on what you enjoy,” Aliche said. Or, even if it’s not something you enjoy per se, it can help you pay for what you need, like housing. Overall, your odds of winning a Powerball prize of any amount are 1 in 24.9, the lottery says. But the chances of winning the big jackpot are so low — think 1 in 292 million — why not put most of what you usually spend on the lottery into an online high-yield savings account instead, many of which are paying between 4.5% and 5% interest? Think of it this way: Let’s say you spend $35 a week on lottery tickets ($1,820 a year). And, all in, maybe you win $100 over the course of a year. That means you’re out $1,720. If instead you had banked that $1,820 at 5%, you’d have more than $1,900 on hand instead. High-yield accounts at FDIC-insured online banks let you park money you can tap any time you need it. And when you see your balance grow through regular, automated deposits, you might grow fond of the habit. That, in turn, will put you in a better position financially, whatever your goals. — CNN’s Chris Isidore contributed to this report",Business
Why aren’t more women leading US companies? Americans weigh in," Women have made huge strides in business, ascending to the C-suite and the boardroom in record numbers. But they are still very far from achieving parity with men in securing top corporate jobs in the United States. Women make up half the US population. But they only account for 10.6% of Fortune 500 chief executives, 30.4% of US board members and 32.8% of college and university presidents, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew decided to ask Americans why they think that is and whether they expect more women to occupy top business roles anytime soon. So they surveyed a nationally representative sampling of US adults. In response to the question, “Why aren’t there more women in top executive business positions?” respondents identified several “major” reasons. Top among them: When asked whether there will ever be as many women as men in top executive positions in the business world, 50% said men will continue to outnumber women. Another 48% said it’s “only a matter of time” before there are as many women as men occupying the top roles. Pew compared responses from men and women, and from respondents identifying as Democrats or Republicans. Most women (65%) and most Democrats, regardless of gender, (76%) said there are too few women in business leadership. Among all those who said this, a large majority (79%) said ideally there should be the same number of women and men in these roles. Another 10% said more women than men would be ideal, and another 10% said it would be ideal to have more women but still not as many women as men. Between the major political parties, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to see multiple factors as major obstacles for women seeking top leadership positions in business. But gender overrode political affiliation when it came to citing views on why more women aren’t at the top in the business world. “Republican and Democratic women are more likely than their male counterparts to say there are too few women in top business leadership positions and to point to certain factors as major obstacles for women,” Pew said. (Here is a look at all the survey questions and responses.)",Business
Gen Xers are next in line for retirement. Many haven’t saved nearly enough," Gen Xers are now in their 40s and 50s and account for about a fifth of the US population. As the next generation in line to retire behind the Baby Boomers, their experience may be a cautionary tale for those coming up behind them. A recent report from the National Institute on Retirement Security suggests that many Gen Xers simply aren’t building enough savings to maintain their standard of living when they retire. “The data pretty clearly indicates that the system we have in place now will not provide adequate income for many workers,” said Tyler Bond, NIRS research director and coauthor of “The Forgotten Generation: Generation X Approaches Retirement.” The system Bond refers to is the mostly do-it-yourself model of saving for retirement that came of age when Gen Xers did. They were the first generation to enter the labor market after the shift from employer-run defined benefit pension plans to 401(k)-style defined contribution accounts. While the oldest Gen X adults are more likely than younger ones to have at least some pension income to supplement their own savings and Social Security benefits in retirement, most will not. Specifically, only 14% of working Gen X adults are in a defined benefit pension plan, according to the NIRS report, which analyzed 2020 data from the federal Survey of Income and Program Participation. As for savings in workplace retirement plans and IRAs, “the bottom half of [Gen X] earners have only a few thousand dollars saved,” authors of the NIRS report wrote. And the median amount that Gen X households have in retirement savings — meaning half have less, half have more — is just $40,000. Income is the single biggest factor in determining who has built savings and who has not. “Retirement savings for Generation X is highly concentrated among the highest earners,” the report notes. Nevertheless, the average Gen X retirement savings balance (nearly $130,000 for individuals and $243,000 for households) suggests that many higher earners may not be saving enough, if those savings are intended to be one’s main source of income in retirement. That is a likely scenario for many, since most people won’t have a pension, and Social Security benefits for high earners (whose career-average earnings range roughly between $100,000 and $150,000 in Social Security’s model) is intended to replace only between a quarter to a third of one’s income if one retires at “full” retirement age — which is 67 for Gen Xers. Keep in mind, too, that Social Security benefits for some might ultimately be reduced since lawmakers have yet to address the program’s long-term solvency. Current projections suggest that if no action is taken, Social Security will only be able to pay 80% of promised benefits by 2034, which is when Gen Xers will have begun retiring. While higher earners across all groups do better than lower earners, looking specifically through the lens of race and ethnicity among employed Gen Xers, Black and Hispanic workers have the lowest savings accumulations and are the least likely to have access to and participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans. The average retirement account balance is $53,456 for Black workers and $42,335 for Hispanic workers; while their medians are $1 and zero, respectively, according to the report. By contrast, the averages are $165,917 for White workers and $189,764 for Asian workers, and their medians are $26,900 and $30,000, respectively. Across the board, however, “most Gen Xers, regardless of race, gender, marital status or income, are failing to meet retirement savings targets,” the report notes. Setting benchmark targets can be tricky since each person’s circumstance is different and may change over the years for better or worse. But one broad recommendation suggests that by age 45, one should have saved two to four times one’s household income; three to six times by age 50 and four-and-a-half to eight times by 55. How much any individual should have saved by retirement depends on many factors — including what age they retire, their marital status, where and how they plan to live, whether they will have a steady monthly paycheck from a pension, how much they can expect from Social Security and how much may come from other potential income sources in retirement, such as part-time work or a rental property. If you are a Gen Xer concerned that you won’t have enough in retirement, there are some things you can do today, along with some benefits available now and coming online in a few years, that may help. Assess where you stand: Figure out what likely sources of income and income-producing assets will be available to you in retirement. For instance, you can request a benefits estimate here to determine what Social Security may pay you based on your earnings to date. Your 401(k) provider, such as Fidelity, Vanguard or T Rowe Price, likely has calculators online to help you assess if you’re on track to have adequate savings in retirement. Determine what changes you can make: Whether it is saving more, planning to retire later and/or postpone taking your Social Security benefits to age 70 to get a larger monthly check, now is a good time to figure what levers you can pull to improve your financial situation in the future. If you can afford it, you may get helpful guidance, too, from a fee-only certified financial planner or a financial adviser who has a stated fiduciary responsibility to serve your interests only and who is not paid a commission to put clients’ money in specific investment products. Or check to see if your employer has an employee assistance program (EAP) that offers free or subsidized financial coaching. Stay informed about new programs and benefits: Nineteen states and counting have introduced new programs to make saving easier for workers and the self-employed who don’t have access to a workplace retirement plan. Most take the form of an auto IRA contribution model, which provides an easy, tax-advantaged way to save and invest for retirement through automatic deductions from their paycheck. The rules differ by state, but some allow employers to make contributions to their employees’ accounts. Two recently enacted federal laws, meanwhile, are intended to help working adults save more and get access to workplace retirement plans. They are the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019 and SECURE 2.0, which was enacted last year. One provision that may be especially helpful to Gen Xers who work part-time — many of whom are women — is a requirement that employers must grant a part-time worker access to the company retirement plan if that employee worked at least 500 hours per year for two consecutive years. Also, changes to an existing Saver’s Credit may help lower income Gen Xers. “The Saver’s Credit will become a Saver’s Match beginning in 2027 and, significantly, it will become refundable, meaning a tax filer will not have to have a tax liability in order to claim the match,” the NIRS report notes. “The Saver’s Match will equal 50 percent of a tax filer’s retirement plan contribution, up to a maximum match of $2,000, and the match will be deposited directly into the filer’s retirement plan account.”",Business
Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd steps down as CEO. She’ll be replaced by Slack’s leader," Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd is stepping down as chief executive after nearly a decade running the dating app company. Starting on January 2, Wolfe Herd will be succeeded by Lidiane Jones, a longtime tech executive who has been serving since December as the CEO of the workplace communication service Slack, Bumble confirmed in a securities filing Monday. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as executive chair. “This move to Executive Chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth,” Wolfe Herd said in a statement, adding that she and Jones would be “fantastic partners.” The leadership transition was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Wolfe Herd started her career at rival dating service Tinder, which she co-founded. But she left in 2014 and filed a lawsuit against the company alleging sexual harassment and discrimination, which was eventually settled. She then launched Bumble based on the idea that giving women the chance to make the first move on a dating app would empower them with more control over their romantic lives. Wolfe Herd founded Bumble with the help of Andrey Andreev, the former owner of the dating app Badoo; in 2019, she became head of the combined company after Andreev was accused of racism and sexism. Today, Bumble is the parent company of four apps — Bumble, Official, Badoo and Fruitz — and the Bumble app has expanded to include features to help people find friends and professional connections. The company has more than 3.6 million paying users across its apps, according to its most recent earnings report. When Bumble made its initial public offering in 2021, Wolfe Herd, then 31, became one of the world’s youngest self-made female billionaires. But since then, the company’s share price has foundered. Bumble (BMBL) shares opened trading at $76 dollars on the day of its IPO but are now trading below $14, a more than 80% decline. The company’s stock fell an another 8% on Monday following news of Wolfe Herd’s departure from the CEO role. Bumble is set to report earnings for the quarter ended in September on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts expect the company’s sales to grow 19% from the year-ago quarter to to $276.9 million, but profits are projected to fall by 31% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv estimates. Jones will take control of Bumble at a time when analysts are concerned that the uncertain economic environment could make consumers less likely to shell out for dating app subscriptions and as persistent inflation weighs on many tech companies’ earnings. Shares of Match Group, the Bumble competitor and Tinder parent company, tumbled last week after the company said in its earnings report for the September quarter that its number of paying customers had declined by 5% year-over-year. Bumble’s stock also dipped on news of Match’s earnings report. Before taking over as CEO of Slack late last year, Jones spent four years in various executive roles at Slack parent company Salesforce, most recently as executive vice president of digital experiences. Prior to Salesforce, Jones was the vice president of software product management at speaker company Sonos and spent 12 years at Microsoft. Jones will remain at Slack through the end of this year. “As a woman who has spent her career in technology, it’s a gift to lean on my experience to lead a company dedicated to women and encouraging equality, integrity and kindness, all deeply personal and inspiring to me,” Jones said in a statement about joining Bumble.",Business
"Behold ‘Grok,’ Elon Musk’s AI chatbot with a ‘rebellious’ streak"," Brace yourselves. Jokes incoming. Elon Musk has announced the introduction of “Grok,” an artificially intelligent chatbot, for some users of X, which the billionaire suggests has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own. Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year, announced late Saturday that Grok is being trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform. Musk’s AI startup, xAI, which developed the bot, said in a blogpost that it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams. Grok “loves sarcasm,” Musk posted on X. “I have no idea who could have guided it this way.” “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” xAI said in its blogpost. The bot is still in an early stage of testing, Musk said﻿, but will soon be made available to subscribers of X’s Premium+ service, who, in the United States, pay $16 a month for features such as the once-coveted blue checkmark. Grok is intended to rival ChatGPT, an AI chatbot released to the public by its maker OpenAI last November to much fanfare. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down as chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co﻿mpany’s direction. In its blogpost, xAI said the large language model (LLM) — the type of system used to train AI applications — underpinning Grok-1 had outstripped the capabilities of GPT-3.5, the LLM that trains the publicly available version of ChatGPT, on several measures, including solving some high school math problems. “It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and compute resources like GPT-4,” the company said. Musk has previously expressed concerns about the speed of development of AI, and the technology’s potential to fundamentally change human society for the worse. xAI said it expects Grok to rapidly improve as X’s users feed it with more information, which may fuel unease among those critical of Musk’s handling of the platform since he bought the company last October. The world’s richest person has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said that, under his leadership, the company would be “very reluctant” to delete content and permanently ban some users. British far-right figure Tommy Robinson, who has a history of posting Islamophobic content on X, thanked Musk Sunday for reinstating his account, five years after being banned.",Business
Epic Games goes to court to challenge Google’s app store practices," Epic Games, the maker of the popular game “Fortnite,” launches a battle against Google in federal court today in a closely watched antitrust showdown that could reshape how smartphone users get Android apps and pay for in-app content. Epic’s lawsuit in the US District Court in California’s Northern District targets the Google Play Store, focusing on Google’s fees for in-app subscriptions and one-off transactions, along with other terms that app developers such as Epic say helped Google maintain an illegal monopoly in app distribution. The legal battle follows a years-long debate about whether app store operators such as Google and Apple foster an open, competitive app ecosystem. The two companies argue their app stores help unlock billions in revenue for small businesses, while ensuring that Android and iOS users benefit from security oversight that the technology giants provide. The jury may hear high-profile witnesses testify from both sides, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. The court fight traces back to 2020, when Epic launched Project Liberty, a plan to circumvent Apple and Google’s app store terms. That move by Epic forced a confrontation with the tech giants. Epic updated the Fortnite app to encourage players to pay for in-app content directly through Epic’s own website — rather than through Apple and Google’s in-app payment systems. That gambit triggered a violation of the app stores’ developer terms. The move also prompted both app stores to remove the Fortnite app from their platforms. It meant Apple users could no longer play Fortnite on iOS devices. Epic’s case involving Apple may soon be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Fortnite is still available on Android devices through a variety of non-Google channels. In the meantime, Sweeney has alleged that Google “controls, surveils, and taxes transactions between users and developers” in violation of US antitrust law. Google has argued Epic simply wants access to the Play Store’s 2.5 billion users worldwide without having to pay to support the platform, and that a victory for Epic could harm Google’s ability to offer a competitive Android alternative to Apple’s iOS. “The most relevant thing for us is showcasing to the jury how Android has created more choice, flexibility and openness than any other platform, and that Epic has actually availed itself of that level of choice and flexibility,” said Wilson White, Google’s vice president of public policy and government affairs. “As a result, these needless claims that they’ve brought should fail.” The suite against Google initially involved a wide range of plaintiffs, including dozens of state attorneys general and individual consumers, as well as Match Group, the online dating giant that owns apps including Tinder, Hinge and Match. But Google successfully narrowed the list of opponents it would face at trial as it reached multiple settlements removing other plaintiffs from the case. Epic will now face off against Google in court alone.",Business
"Google, Lendlease axe plans for $15 billion development in Bay Area"," Alphabet’s Google has scrapped a development deal to build $15 billion worth of homes, offices and retail space in California’s Silicon Valley. Google and Australian developer Lendlease “mutually reached” a decision to end their San Francisco Bay Project for four master-planned districts in the cities of San Jose, Sunnyvale and Mountain View, Lendlease announced Friday. “The decision to end these agreements followed a comprehensive review by Google of its real estate investments, and a determination by both organizations that the existing agreements are no longer mutually beneficial given current market conditions,” Lendlease said in a statement. A Google spokesperson told CNN on Saturday that it is still looking to deliver on its housing commitment but Lendlease would not be its exclusive developer. The tech giant said it is broadening its relationships and will work with both developers and capital partners to move the Bay Area developments forward. The spokesperson added that Google will continue to advance mixed-use entitlements and invest in infrastructure. “As we’ve shared before, we’ve been optimizing our real estate investments in the Bay Area, and part of that work is looking at a variety of options to move our development projects forward and deliver on our housing commitment,” Alexa Arena, Google’s senior director of development, said Friday in a statement. “We appreciate Lendlease and the work the team has done to get us to this point.” Construction was expected to start on the project during Lendlease’s 2026 fiscal year. The announcement comes amid a period of deep cost-cutting and layoffs for Google and during a time when commercial real estate is faltering. Friday’s announcement also is the latest in a series of setbacks for tech giants’ large-scale community investments and adds uncertainty for Google’s much-touted plans to help address the affordability crisis in the tech-laden Bay Area. In June 2019, Google made a $1 billion pledge to help develop more affordable housing in the increasingly unaffordable region. At the time, Google said it would repurpose at least $750 million of the land it owns for at least 15,000 new homes priced for a variety of income levels and put $250 million toward a developer incentive fund to build 5,000 affordable housing units. “Our goal is to help communities succeed over the long term, and make sure that everyone has access to opportunity, whether or not they work in tech,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post in June 2019. A month later, Google partnered with Lendlease to redevelop its landholdings for a 10- to 15-year project valued at $15 billion. Earlier this year, Google said 12,900 residences had been approved in Mountain View and San Jose, and more than 3,800 affordable modular homes and other affordable units were under construction. “We’ve made steady progress, but it hasn’t been without its challenges,” Scott Foster, Google’s vice president of real estate and workplace services, wrote in the blog post. “And while we expect more periods of slowdown and others of acceleration, we remain committed to working alongside local governments and organizations to address the rising need for housing in our community.” The announcement comes during a tumultuous period for Alphabet and other tech firms that have cut tens of thousands of jobs after drastically scaling up during the pandemic. Alphabet, which added 50,000 jobs during the past two years, announced in January it would slash 12,000 jobs, affecting about 6% of its workforce. The company, which has emphasized broader cost-cutting efforts, laid off hundreds more employees in September. Although the US economy has remained remarkably resilient following the Covid-19 pandemic and despite wars overseas, high inflation and sharply rising interest rates, the commercial real estate industry has been on much shakier footing. Office and retail property valuations have fallen since the pandemic brought about lower occupancy rates and changes in where people work and how they shop. The Federal Reserve’s efforts to fight inflation by raising interest rates have also hurt the credit-dependent industry. Regional banking stress only added to those woes. Lending to commercial real estate developers and managers largely comes from small and mid-sized banks, where the pressure on liquidity has been most severe. About 80% of all bank loans for commercial properties come from regional banks, according to Goldman Sachs economists. This story has been updated with additional information.",Business
Striking actors are reviewing Hollywood and TV studios’ ‘best and final offer’," A deal to resolve film and television actors’ 113-day strike could be imminent, as the union representing them said it is reviewing Hollywood and TV studios’ final offer. The negotiating committee for the SAG-AFTRA union on Saturday said it received a “last, best and final offer” from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, whose members include Disney, Netflix, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery. Warner Bros. Discovery in the parent company of CNN. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the heads of the major studios met virtually with the actors’ guild negotiating committee on Saturday to discuss the latest offer. “We are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals,” the union said in a statement. It’s not clear that a deal will be reached. The union and studio executives have been meeting on and off for months with many promising developments and disappointing setbacks along the way. SAG-AFTRA, which represents about 160,000 actors, announced it would walk off sets on July 14, joining the striking writers in a historic double walkout against the studios — the first time the writers and actors had simultaneously been on strike in more than 60 years. Both the actors and writers fought for updated deals that better paid them for shows and movies on streaming services. They both demanded better benefits and wanted restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence, a technology that actors and writers alike believe poses an existential threat to their livelihoods. Even if a deal is reached soon, it would not necessarily end the strike. The deal would still need to be ratified by union members before it goes into effect, and many unions across multiple industries have been voting down contracts in recent months. An online petition signed by more than 5,000 members recently urged the union to take a hard line in negotiations toward a final deal, saying they would not agree to a deal that did not meet the demands laid out at the start of the strike. But some of Hollywood’s most famous stars have been eager to get back on set. George Clooney, Tyler Perry and other A-list actors offered to pay millions more in union dues to help end the strike, a source with knowledge of the proposal previously told CNN. The SAG-AFTRA union’s demand for an 11% wage increase in the first year of the proposed contract term has been a major impediment to a resolution: The studios had agreed to a 5% pay raise. In recent days, the union suggested the studio and the negotiators were getting closer on some key issues but remained far apart on others. Disney’s Bob Iger, Warner Bros. Discovery’s David Zaslav, Netflix’s Ted Sarandos, and NBC Universal’s Donna Langley have been directly involved in negotiations.",Business
William Lewis is named publisher and CEO of the Washington Post," The Washington Post on Saturday named news media veteran William Lewis as its new publisher and CEO at a critical time for the newspaper, as it contends with financial trouble, a rapidly shifting media environment and a looming presidential election. Lewis will assume the role on January 2, 2024, the Post said in a statement. “Leading this bold media brand means building on my commitment to championing high-quality journalism and safeguarding our democratic values, while growing The Post’s business and advancing its impact to the next generation and beyond,” Lewis said in the statement. Lewis will take the helm of one the nation’s most storied media properties at a time of change for American journalism in general and for the Washington Post in particular, where layoffs, declining readership and high expenses have dented morale. Lewis, the founder, CEO and publisher of Gen-Z focused The News Movement, is a former CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, and the paper’s traffic surged in the years immediately after, particularly after former President Donald Trump took office. But the paper of record in the nation’s capital has struggled to maintain readership in the post-Trump era. As with much of the news industry, the Washington Post has faced a reckoning as Americans’ reading habits have shifted in recent years. Interim chief executive Patty Stonesifer previously told employees that the paper had “overshot on expenses” under former CEO Fred Ryan. She also disclosed that the publication’s readership has plummeted since Trump’s White House exit, with its digital audience sinking by a staggering 28% since 2021. Digital subscriptions, Stonesifer added, had dropped 15%. Previous publisher and chief executive Fred Ryan announced in June that he was stepping down after nearly a decade heading up the Washington Post. While he helped lead the paper to more than a dozen Pulitzers and industry-wide acclaim, he also alienated much of the newsroom late last year when he abruptly announced layoffs. “Ten years ago, I made a commitment to the future of The Washington Post, inspired by its ambitious and consequential journalism,” said Bezos in a statement. “Today, I stand confident in that future knowing it is in the hands of Will, an exceptional, tenacious industry executive whose background in fierce, award-winning journalism makes him the right leader at the right time.” CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed reporting.",Business
White House condemns Fox News for ‘standing up on behalf of hate’ after host attacks CNN anchors’ Jewish heritage," The White House denounced Fox News on Friday, blasting the right-wing network for “standing up on behalf of hate” after one of its hosts attacked the Jewish heritage of two CNN anchors over their coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. “Not only is Fox News aligning with those who fan the flames of hate – Fox is paying their salaries,” Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, said in a blistering statement, marking the second time this week the Biden administration publicly condemned the network for its hosts’ commentary. The rebuke came in response to Mark Levin, a right-wing talk personality and Fox News weekend host, who raged against CNN anchors Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper in recent days while ranting on his nationally syndicated radio show. Levin falsely claimed Blitzer’s parents “weren’t victims in one way or another, of the Holocaust.” In fact, Blitzer’s parents were survivors of the Nazi-era concentration camps and all four of his grandparents were murdered during the Holocaust. Levin added that he believed CNN was “filled with a lot of self-hating Jews.” In separate comments, Levin also attacked Tapper as a “self-hating Jew” and said he is “a propagandist for the enemy.” CNN condemned the comments on Thursday evening as “wildly uninformed, inappropriate and shameful,” and said Levin’s “antisemitic rhetoric is dangerous, offensive and should be universally denounced.” The White House added its rebuke of Fox News on Friday. “Lying to insult the pain that families suffered in the Holocaust has absolutely no place in America. None,” Bates said. “Sadly, this is not the first time in recent months that a Fox News host made sickening remarks about the Holocaust.” “What’s more, it isn’t even the first time this week that a Fox host chose to abuse their platform and spread hate,” Bates continued, referencing Islamophobic remarks made by prime time host Jesse Watters about Arab Americans and the entire Muslim world. “Even after the heartbreaking killing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American child and a surge in violence against Muslims and Arab Americans, two nights ago Jesse Watters made vile comments that attack the dignity of all Americans, saying he’s ‘done’ with Arab Americans and Muslims,” Bates added. A Fox News spokesperson did not immediately have a comment. But Levin stood by his comments Thursday night while responding to CNN’s condemnation of his remarks. “My antisemitic rhetoric? This is why I despise these people and you should too,” Levin said on his radio show. “They think they’re going to intimidate me? They think they’re going to silence me?” Levin went on to claim that CNN “is one of the most pro-Hamas media outlets in the country.” CNN has repeatedly described Hamas as a terrorist organization and the network has — through on-the-ground interviews, digital stories and on-air pieces — spent considerable time spotlighting the horror that unfolded during the group’s attack on Israel last month. Levin also attacked CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, claiming she was “giving aid and comfort” to Hamas by asking Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin whether a humanitarian ceasefire should be implemented. The White House in recent months has assumed an aggressive posture toward Fox News, calling out some of the extremist rhetoric that the network’s hosts have made. In July, the White House condemned Holocaust remarks made by host Greg Gutfeld, saying they amounted to a “horrid, dangerous, and extreme lie” that “insults the memory of the millions of people who suffered from the evils” committed by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime. And earlier this week, the White House denounced the comments made by Watters, which Fox News has remained silent on.",Business
White House calls on Fox News to apologize after top host’s ‘sickening’ Islamophobic rant," Fox News is showing its true colors, yet again. The right-wing television network has remained entirely silent amid fierce backlash stemming from Islamophobic comments made on its top-rated show, “The Five,” by one of its top hosts, Jesse Watters. In an astonishing and ugly rant, Watters on Wednesday said that he was fed up with Arab Americans and the entire Muslim world. “We have had it with them,” Watters declared during the diatribe, which aired during a segment about activists ripping down posts spotlighting Israeli hostages. “And so, if you’re an Arab American in this country, and you ripped down posters of Jewish hostages of American hostages — no, no, no, no, someone is going to get punched in the face when you rip down posters of hostages like that,” Watters added. The remarks earned Watters and Fox News another stinging rebuttal from the White House, which called them a “sickening attack on the rights and dignity of their fellow Americans.” The White House added that Fox News “owes an apology to every single viewer.” If you’re waiting for an apology from Fox News, however, don’t hold your breath (you should probably know this by now). As usual, Fox News hasn’t said a word about the hateful rant that streamed out of a top host’s mouth and into the homes of millions. And it’s not the first time that Watters has made abhorrent comments since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out. In October, Watters said, “I don’t like how people try to differentiate between the Palestinians and Hamas.” “To me, I see people with guns. That’s Hamas. The people without the guns are the Palestinians. They believe the same thing,” Watters said at the time. “The Palestinians hire Hamas to run their government. You poll them; they all love killing Jews. It’s in their charter. They say they believe in suicide bombings.” At an actual news organization, and in the vast majority of corporate America, such comments would unquestionably be unacceptable. The host would almost certainly be publicly reprimanded, and an apology would immediately be issued — at the very least. But Fox News is much different. Its refusal to address the matter underscores once more that Rupert Murdoch’s television arm is comfortable broadcasting hate to the masses. Tucker Carlson might be gone, but appalling comments like this still find their way to air — and the network turns a blind eye to it. It goes without saying that voicing hate — and profiting from it — is a reprehensible act. But in the charged environment we now find ourselves in, where hate against Muslim Americans is surging alongside anti-Semitism, it is particularly irresponsible and repugnant. Stamping out bigotry from the public discourse should be everyone’s mission. For some, however, injecting intolerance into the conversation seems to be the modus operandi.",Business
Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging," It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. “The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings. “The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.” Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. “This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone. “A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.” This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan. Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora
            
                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry. Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,
            
                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year. The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand. Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. “As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.” Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value. So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it. But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary. “As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”",Business
The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric," General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning. Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. “Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance. GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.",Business
This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast," Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram. There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms. The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance. We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it. BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year. As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life. It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see. The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms. The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.”  That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane. There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique. “Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.” That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you.  (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.) The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner. With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time. Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August. “What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government. Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms. “I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.” When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie. The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready. BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity. BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app. Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online. “I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says. Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives. “It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.” In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says. “BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,”  the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.” The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos. But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app. “There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says. “It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.” The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps. Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well. Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says. “For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says. “Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”",Business
"BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship"," Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan. While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday. With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300. This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge. BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems. A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets. Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design. The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries. The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space. Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology. “There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists. Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back. As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space. BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked. Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard. The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night. For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times. The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode. A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area. Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car. A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react. BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.",Business
Apple’s ‘scary fast’ upgrades hint at its vision for the AI era," During an Apple product launch the night before Halloween, Apple CEO Tim Cook – wearing all black at its Cupertino, California-based headquarters – introduced the next phase of Mac computers which hint at a more AI- driven future. The focus of the event, which featured the tagline “scary fast,” was Apple’s new custom-made M3 chips, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Pro Max. These processors promise faster computing and graphics and longer-lasting battery life, but can also better support advancements with artificial intelligence because they’re made with 3 nanometer technology, according to the company. The chips will ship with Apple’s latest MacBook Pro and iMac lineup. “They are the most advanced chips ever created for a personal computer,” Cook said. “This deep integration is something only Apple can deliver, and we never stop innovating.” At a time companies such as Microsoft, Google and Meta have openly discussed their plans for an AI future, Apple has been less forthcoming. (It has, however, reportedly been working on its own generative AI tools to rival ChatGPT). Some analysts believe Apple’s vision for how it can support work in the AI field and harness the power of its new chip were evident from the Halloween event. “Apple may not wax eloquent about AI but it knows very well that the use cases for this technology are booming and that the development work will require unprecedented computing power,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at Forrester. “That’s a huge emerging opportunity, and Apple wants a piece of that pie.” ‘So, how hard can it be?’ During the presentation, Apple showed how researchers can conduct an analysis on an M3 device for complex tasks such as DNA/RNA sequencing, which could help detect early-stage cancers or help prevent pandemics, from anywhere in the world. It also touted a promo video that demonstrated how the Mac can be used to do anything from analyzing ECG signals to mapping the structure of the galaxies. “It’s hard work,” one actor in the video says. “But you’re on a Mac,” says another. “So how hard can it be?” The upgrades come at a time when Apple is gaining substantial ground in the traditional PC and laptop market but still ranks fourth behind Lenovo, Dell and HP in the number of products shipped, according to IDC Research. Apple said it shipped about 26 million Macs in 2022, making up 9.1% of the overall market (up from 7.8% the year prior). At the same time, the overall PC market shipped about 292 million computers the same year, down 15% from the year before. The iPhone and Apple services — such as iCloud, Apple TV+ and Apple Music — remain a major revenue driver for the company, but Macs and iPad sales have declined year over year, largely due to weaker demand, excess inventory and a worsening macroeconomic climate. “Apple is looking for a revenue bump, especially going into the holidays, from the new iPhone 15, but the sense is that demand is tepid, especially out of China which is a significant market for the brand,” said Chatterjee. “If iPhone revenue slows down, something has to offset that.” ‘Building their own sandbox’ It’s difficult, however, to predict how the new chip will impact the total sales of the computer market, according to David McQueen, a director at ABI Research. He said Apple aims to pit itself against Intel, as well as Qualcomm, AMD, NVIDIA and Dell, not only as a performance leader but with chips that support productivity-related AI tools. “It is an important part of Apple’s strategy to make sure performance of its silicon can keep up with or ahead of its competitors,” McQueen said. Meanwhile, Kieren Jessop, an analyst with UK-based market research firm Canalys, said it’s less about Apple catching up and more about “running their own race.” “Apple’s emphasis on the ‘Pro’ user makes it clear they’re calling on developers to amplify the power of their platform … building their own sandbox for developers to build in,” he said. Although Apple’s vision for the AI era is still not abundantly clear, the introduction of the M3 chip for its MacBook Pro and iMac lines “solidified its commitment to a future rich in AI integration,” he added.",Business
Cold weather testing: Airplanes endure punishing extremes," With extremely cold temperatures gripping much of the United States, travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying. The short answer: Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off, airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service. CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers, mechanics and test pilots. Their mission was to see how their test plane, a long-range A350 XWB, withstood extreme cold. The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse, France, base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit, the capital of Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut. The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to  -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test. All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions, from freezing to intense heat. “Coming to an extreme place means we can break everything,” Airbus’ head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters. Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways. Metals, such as steel and aluminum, contract at different rates. Lubricants may lose their viscosity, creating friction and wear issues for moving parts. Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle. The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia. Next stop was Qatar for hot-weather testing. For years Iqaluit, located on Baffin Island, has marketed itself as “a premier cold-weather test site.” Airbus has tested there since the 1990s, while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing, Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials. But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places. In April 2010, Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner. In a test chamber the aircraft was given a “cold soak” and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit (-42.7 degrees Celsius) for hours. Later, it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), also for hours. “These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe (and in all seasons),” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a news release. But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature. Initially scheduled for five days, Airbus’ tests in Iqaluit were cut short, not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius – too warm for the cold weather testing.",Business
"In less than a week, Sam Bankman-Fried’s $16 billion fortune evaporated"," Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out. Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.” FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive. The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing. He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry. Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans. As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt. On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”",Business
"What is Binance, why is it in so much trouble, and what does it mean for crypto?"," There are few figures in crypto that have loomed quite as large in the past few years than Changpeng Zhao — better known as CZ — and the company he founded in 2017, Binance. Not only is Binance the world’s biggest crypto exchange, it is orders of magnitude larger than its rivals. Up until recently, Binance boasted nearly 60% of the market share for crypto spot trading. Even as that share has waned to closer to 40% since US regulators amped up pressure on the company starting in June, no other exchange even comes close. The Seychelles-based OKX is second in market share at 5.44% and the US exchange Coinbase is third at 5.37%, according to crypto news site CoinDesk. But Binance’s future at the top of the crypto world is now far from certain as it faces a record $4.3 billion payout to US authorities to resolve criminal charges. Zhao on Tuesday resigned as CEO and pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges. US officials called the settlement the biggest-ever corporate resolution involving criminal charges for an executive. Following a multiyear investigation, US authorities said Binance allowed bad actors on the platform, enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics and terrorist financing. Further, Binance did not have protocols to flag or report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. As one compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents: ﻿“we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.’” Zhao faces a maximum of 10 years behind bars, though his ultimate sentence will likely be far lower. He also agreed to pay a $50 million criminal fine and a $150 million civil penalty. “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,” Zhao posted on X. “This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself. Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run.” Binance, like its infamous former rival FTX, has been quick to point out that it grew its business rapidly in a chaotic, largely unregulated industry. “While Binance is not perfect, it has strived to protect users since its early days as a small startup and has made tremendous efforts to invest in security and compliance,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Binance grew at an extremely fast pace globally… [and] made misguided decisions along the way. Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.” It’s a common refrain among crypto firms who find themselves under scrutiny. But federal authorities have made clear that they’re not going to pull any punches when it comes to corporate crime, in crypto or elsewhere. Analysts see the settlement as a partial victory for Binance and Zhao. “The avoidance of prison time for CZ and the ability for the exchange to continue operations, albeit without CZ as its CEO, is likely the best outcome given the severity of the accusations against Binance,” said Robert Le, crypto analyst for PitchBook. “Binance’s initial ‘move fast and break things’ approach, which involved offering products that were illegal or entering markets without proper licenses, has led to its current predicament.” The initial market response to the Binance news was muted, with Bitcoin slipping just over 1% Tuesday afternoon — hardly a blip in the notoriously volatile market. Investors and entrepreneurs in the crypto space just want to see the industry move on from its early days of idolizing founders. “The question really is whether or not crypto is actually growing up in a way that is allowing it to have an existence beyond its influential founders who have been shepherding the brand, shepherding the innovation, shepherding the advocacy for these institutions,” said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert on financial regulation. “That’s something that will have to be seen over the next couple of months.” Yadav notes that the $4.3 billion deal for Binance reflects its status as a systemically important institution — potentially too big to fail. “What this plea deal does is give Binance as a chance to live another day,” Yadav said. “I think that reflects a worry that if Binance were to be killed, that would cause further damage to average folks who hold money on it to the industry as a whole.”",Markets
CEO of world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange pleads guilty to money laundering violations," Billionaire Changpeng Zhao and leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance pleaded guilty on Tuesday to federal charges in a watershed moment designed to bring order to the often-lawless crypto industry. As part of a coordinated settlement across the federal government, Binance has agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other penalties. Zhao, one of the most powerful figures in crypto, has agreed to step down as CEO from the exchange that he founded, and he will pay $200 million in fines. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations. US officials described this as the biggest-ever corporate resolution that includes criminal charges for an executive. Following a years-long investigation, authorities allege Binance allowed bad actors to freely transact on the platform, enabling everything from child sex abuse and narcotics to terrorist financing for ISIS, Al Qaeda and Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades. Zhao, who has amassed a fortune estimated at more than $23 billion, pled guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. US authorities hope the guilty plea from Binance and its founder, on top of the recent conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, will send a clear message to bad actors across the crypto industry. “Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Zhao faces a maximum of 10 years behind bars, though his ultimate sentence will likely be far lower. Federal guidelines likely place the high end of a possible sentence for Zhao around 18 months. Sentencing is ultimately decided by a judge. According to the plea deal, Zhao agreed to prosecutors’ recommendation that he pay a fine of $50 million. In addition to the criminal fine, Zhao will pay $150 million in civil penalties, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The proposed consent order also requires Binance to disgorge $1.35 billion of ill-gotten gains and pay a $1.35 billion civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. “Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profits,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers through its platform.” The Binance guilty plea is part of a coordinated settlement reached with a wide range of government agencies, including the Justice Department, Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Treasury described the Binance settlement as its largest enforcement in history. “The Binance platform was facilitating some truly horrible stuff – everything from terrorist financing to ransomware actions, child pornography and various scams and frauds,” a senior Treasury official told reporters. US officials say Binance allowed more than 100,000 transactions involving illicit activity as well as more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated US sanctions, including sanctions on Iran, Syria and Cuba. Just as authorities announced the settlement, Zhao confirmed in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he has stepped down as CEO. “Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do,” Zhao said. “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibilities. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.” Zhao will be succeeded by Richard Teng, who previously served as Binance’s global head of regional markets. “While Binance is not perfect, it has strived to protect users since its early days as a small startup and has made tremendous efforts to invest in security and compliance,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Binance grew at an extremely fast pace globally… [and] made misguided decisions along the way. Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.” Federal prosecutors unsealed court records on Tuesday alleging Binance, led by Zhao, processed transactions by customers who operated illicit mixing services and “laundered proceeds of darknet market transactions, hacks, ransomware and scams.” Prosecutors allege that Binance had lax anti-money laundering procedures. This alleged misconduct paved the way for Binance to become king of the crypto exchanges, prosecutors allege. “In part because of this scheme, and because Defendant prioritized growth, market share and profits over compliance with US law (Binance) became the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” prosecutors said. Prosecutors allege Binance, “knowingly failed” to register as a money service business, willfully violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and willfully caused violations of US economic sanctions. The charges, filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, accused Binance of a “deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the US market without implementing controls required by US laws.” Prosecutors allege the misconduct started as early as August 2017, continued until at least October 2022 and included certain Binance officers, directors, employees and agents. As Garland detailed the federal government’s investigation into Binance, he mentioned a message that one compliance employee sent in February 2019 that said the crypto exchange oughta get a banner that says: “Is washing drug money too hard these days? Come to Binance, we got cake for you.” “By failing to comply with US law, Binance made it easy for criminals to move their stolen funds and illicit proceeds on its exchanges,” Garland said. Proponents of digital currencies point out that the great majority of business done via crypto is lawful and legitimate, and a cottage industry of companies have emerged in the last five years that work with law enforcement to track digital transactions. But top US officials made it crystal clear Wednesday that they’ll continue to keep a close eye on illicit activities surrounding crypto. “Today’s actions show that if you serve US customers, you must comply with US law,” said Nicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general. “US financial institutions are the gatekeepers for the safety and security of our financial system and because Binance serves a substantial amount of US customers, it was a US financial institution that was required to comply with anti-money laundering laws.” Binance’s legal woes follow the collapse of another crypto exchange, FTX, and the conviction of it founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. Those are the most extreme examples of the greater scrutiny that law enforcement and regulators have brought in recent months to the largely unregulated crypto industry. But ransomware gangs from Russia and money launderers from North Korea, for example, continue to see crypto as core to their business model, and have often used publicly available tools, or “mixing services,” to hide their ill-gotten gains. The US Justice Department in August unsealed federal charges against the co-founders of one such service, Tornado Cash, accusing them of moving $1 billion in cryptocurrency for criminals. One of the Tornado Cash co-founders has pleaded not guilty to the charges while the other remains at large. Officials said they are taking an aggressive, whole-of-government approach to rooting out financial crimes via crypto. “You have seen both in our actions today and in prior cases that we will be relentless in using every tool that we currently have to deploy against those who seek to use technologies in a way that abuse those platforms … or [that] don’t prevent the use of those platforms for illicit activities,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said. Monaco pointed to the creation of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team within the Justice Department as an example that the feds mean business, including how government entities collaborate on investigating crimes involving crypto. Some think more needs to be done. “Regrettably, today’s settlement is not an outlier, and the lawlessness if not criminal activities of crypto will continue and increase until all prosecutors, regulators and elected officials force the industry to act like all other law-abiding people and firms in the financial industry,” Dennis Kelleher, co-founder, president, and CEO of Better Markets, said in a statement. Binance was founded in 2017 by Zhao, a Canadian national. US market regulators this year brought civil cases against Binance, which they accuse of running an illegal exchange for unregistered securities in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission in June sued Binance, saying the company ran an “extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.” Binance has long argued that it isn’t subject to US laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in America. The SEC also alleged that Zhao and Binance commingled customer assets and even diverted some to an entity controlled by Zhao. Zhao claims that the company’s headquarters are wherever he is at any point in time, “reflecting a deliberate approach to attempt to avoid regulation,” according to a complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That agency accused Binance and Zhao of violating US derivatives trading laws in multiple ways, including allegedly secretly coaching “VIP” customers within the United States on how to evade compliance controls. A spokesperson for Binance said in June that the company takes the SEC’s allegations seriously, but it believes the agency’s accusations are “unjustified.” “We respectfully disagree with the SEC’s allegations that Binance operated as an unregistered securities exchange or illegally offered and sold securities,” the company said in a statement. “Because of our size and global name recognition, Binance has found itself an easy target caught in the middle of a US regulatory tug-of-war.” This story has been updated with additional developments.",Markets
"As the CEO of Land O’Lakes, she’s changing the rules of American farming"," In 2023, the surge in responsible investing hit a wall. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives buckled under the pressure of economic and political forces, including efforts by congressional Republicans and conservative-led states to limit “woke” investments that prioritize “agendas and ideology.” But in America’s Heartland, a century-old dairy cooperative and Fortune 500 firm continues to double down on its sustainability-focused investments in the land and in rural communities. At the helm of Land O’Lakes is Beth Ford, the first woman to lead the $19 billion Arden Hills, Minnesota, cooperative, which has 9,000 employees and 2,809 member-owners. Since 2018, when she became chief executive of one of the country’s biggest producers of butter and cheese, Ford has tapped the collective mindset of the company’s farmers, retailers and producers to unabashedly launch initiatives to further rural broadband access, reduce the company’s﻿ carbon footprint, address food supply concerns and promote environmental stewardship. At a time when social and environmental investments have been politicized, Ford and Land O’Lakes are staying the course. Those efforts simply make good business sense, she told CNN. “We’re focusing on the things that are most important to our members, their families and to their businesses,” she told CNN. “And from my perspective, I don’t get involved in politics. We don’t talk politics. We talk policies that are enablers for farmers, for the food supply.” “I talk about trade,” she added: “I talk about the strength of the US dollar … I talk about [how] my responsibility is to make evident to everybody the things that we need to do to continue to invest, to be protective for all of us in our food supply.” Under Ford, Land O’Lakes deepened its investments in Truterra, a subsidiary that bridges data-driven technology with sustainability practices. When Truterra was launched in 2016 under the name SUSTAIN, the business unit explored initiatives such as feed additives to reduce methane emissions from animals, a plastics recycling process and public-private partnerships to reduce water usage and improve soil health. In 2021, Truterra started a program in which it offered upfront cash payments to farmers who sequestered carbon, which involves capturing and storing greenhouse gases naturally produced by plants. Paying out $20,000 on average and up to $100,000 in certain cases, Truterra paid farmers $4 million in its first year for the sequestering of 200,000 metric tons of carbon. In 2022, those payouts grew to $5 million for 273 farmers participating. “We have agronomists, we have one of the first-of-its-kind data models, so we’re working with farmers directly, and it’s about practice change,” Ford said. “And so it’s not really a buzzword, it makes the land more resilient. It makes the farmer more resilient for climate change.” In her role, Ford said she has become a fierce advocate for science and technology, both on the corporate side as well as in the regions that produce the nation’s food. In August, the US Environmental Protection Agency lauded Land O’Lakes as a leader in on-farm sustainability initiatives that help members balance profit and their environmental goals. The EPA and the Hershey Company gave $2 million to Land O’Lakes member farms in Pennsylvania. “I like to mention that 18% to 19% of the population lives in rural America, and they comprise 47% to 48% of the military,” she said. “These are families that are invested in this country, they are constantly doing what is necessary and hard. I admire our farmers, our members. I will be a loud advocate on their behalf because I think it is right for all of us as American citizens.” Throughout her life and career, Ford has long drawn inspiration from her mother. Ford’s mother, Carol, held critical caregiving roles both professionally — as a nurse, a therapist and a minister — and personally, raising eight children with her husband on a working-class budget. That resilience, humility and work ethic became deeply engrained in Ford, who was the fifth of eight children in the Sioux City, Iowa, family. In a 2018 interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow, Ford recalled how her mother told her that “while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.” “She said, ‘Do you understand what is expected of you? Do you understand how much you have? Don’t disappoint,’ and I was like, ‘I’ve got to work hard to not disappoint,’” Ford told Harlow at the time. From the age of 12 and through college, Ford held a variety of jobs, including roles in detasseling corn, babysitting, working as a night cashier and cleaning toilets. The versatility went on to define her nearly 40-year career, at seven companies —  including Pepsi, Mobil and Scholastic — in six industries. “I think that the biggest risk I’ve taken professionally is I’ve moved when I thought I needed to learn something,” she said. “I’ve been in business now for 37 years, and many times I wasn’t familiar with the industry. I don’t think one summer of detasseling corn makes me a farm expert.” She added: “So, the risk is the willingness to be embarrassed, the willingness to leverage your curiosity, to admire the folks who do know and to feel confident and that it’s OK to say, ‘I don’t know. I need your help. Can you help me understand this?’” But early on at Land O’Lakes, Ford also sought to leverage her past experience in other industries to chart a vision for the company: that it is a leader in not just butter but also ag-tech. In 2020, Land O’Lakes convened the American Connection Project coalition to advocate for public and private investment in high-speed internet infrastructure in rural communities. The coalition, which eventually grew to more than 175 members, saw some of its advocacy efforts realized in the passage of the Biden administration’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. Ford said the coalition is part of her commitment to push for investments that protect the food supply and the people who produce it. In agriculture, and especially in commodity-centric businesses such as dairy, change is constant — whether that’s climate events, geopolitical conflict or trade disruptions. But incorporating environmentally sustainable practices or initiatives isn’t always the easiest sell, said Lucas Fuess, economist and senior daily analyst at Rabobank’s RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness team. Many shareholders and prominent politicians, especially in redder states, have been vocal against ESG practices. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds made anti-ESG investing a focus for the 2023 legislative session, calling the investments “not only legally suspect” but “financially reckless.” Earlier this year, nearly two dozen state attorneys general — many of them from agriculture-heavy states like Iowa, Idaho, Kansas and more — warned more than 50 of the country’s largest asset managers against investments “corrupted in favor of a radical social agenda.” With “ESG” and related initiatives in the crosshairs, that means Ford’s efforts carry risks for herself, for her company, for the co-op members and even the buyers browsing their grocery store shelves. For those efforts to be successful, companies and entities have to be on the same page from the farmer level to the co-op level to even the retail and consumer, Fuess said. “A lot of times in tackling sustainability challenges or ESG challenges requires a cost, and I think there’s a lot of discussion on, ‘Where does that money come from?’ and ‘How do we make sure at the end of the day we’re also economically sustainable?’” he said. “I think there continues to be discussions on whether this is something the consumer will have to pay for, or something that has to be absorbed by the processor … or pushed onto farmers to bear,” he said. At the same time, there’s also great potential, he said. “For as much as this is challenging in discussing, I think there’s also an incredible amount of opportunity that can come out of this in working toward these goals and reducing emissions and seeing real accomplishments, and we could hopefully have a really, really good story to tell as the years flow by.” In Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Kelly Garrett has long been a champion of regenerative farming practices. In 2020, he gained media attention for selling carbon credits on the open market. He sold credits for the estimated 22,745 tons of carbon he removed from the atmosphere from 2014-2019 using those farming practices. “The way I looked at it was this is free money for things that I’m already doing and already believed in, and I believe in them [economically],” Garrett told CNN. The attention from his sale eventually led him to Truterra, which appealed to Garrett because of its backing from Land O’Lakes. “The carbon market has kind of been like the wild, wild West, because it’s a little bit unregulated,” he said. “A lot of carbon companies are startups, and they don’t have decent funding. And when the funding dries up, the ethics can kind of dry up.” The weight and financial backing of a century-old cooperative in Land O’Lakes brings an element of security to a practice that some farmers are skeptical of, because they may have been burned in the past, Garrett said. “Let’s be honest here, I farm the way I farm because I think it’s financially the best thing,” he said. “And when I speak to other farmers, I talk about my high-yield path and my sustainable path. The two paths are converging, because we’re trying to farm more in tune with Mother Nature.” In addition to investing in Truterra as well as agriculture technology and economics, Land O’Lakes and Ford remain active and vocal on topics such as agriculture research funding and immigration reform at the federal level. Those types of efforts and investments are especially critical at a time when weather is getting more extreme, water is growing more precious, worker shortages hamper productivity, persistent inflation saps profits and loans are not only more expensive but also harder to come by, Ford said. “The concern sometimes that I have is that there isn’t an understanding of what is required in the food system, the interconnected nature, the fact that we all need to focus on this,” she said. “This isn’t a rural/urban issue, this is an American issue. This is important to all of us.”",Markets
Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman," Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm’s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman’s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman’s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion’s share of the market’s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street’s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech. Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft’s stock following Altman’s and Brockman’s hires. “We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday. Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday. Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker.",Markets
Can Argentina really move from the peso to the dollar?," Javier Milei won Argentina’s presidential election Sunday on a ticket to overhaul South America’s No. 2 economy and ditch its peso currency in favor of the US dollar. Will the Libertarian’s radical plans see the light of day? Milei’s La Libertad Avanza coalition won the election with nearly 56% of the vote, defeating the incumbent center-left Peronist party and its candidate, economy minister Sergio Massa. In his victory speech Sunday, Milei provided few details of the economic policies he plans to adopt when he takes office on December 10. But the self-declared “anarcho-capitalist”— who wielded a chainsaw on the campaign trail to symbolize his plans to cut state spending — promised “drastic” reforms. “The model of decadence has come to an end, there’s no going back,” Milei declared. “Today we end the destructive model of the ever-present state, it only benefits a few while the majority of Argentina suffers,” he added, while also acknowledging the challenges facing him. “We have monumental problems ahead of us: inflation, economic stagnation, lack of genuine employment, insecurity, poverty and indigence.” Financial markets broadly welcomed Milei’s victory, which is likely to usher in a sea change in economic policymaking. Milei must tackle inflation above 140%, a shortfall in foreign currency reserves and the prospect of another painful recession. Argentina’s dollar bonds rose Monday, while the New York-listed shares of several Argentine companies surged. State-owned energy company YPF (YPF) jumped 40%, and banks Banco Macro (BMA) and Grupo Financiero Galicia (GGAL) gained 20%. Argentina’s financial markets are closed for a local holiday, but the peso weakened slightly in partial trade to stand at around 353.58 to the US dollar. The value of the currency has plunged 875% to the dollar over the past five years. Milei has pledged to remove currency controls and import restrictions, which analysts say would result in even more pressure on the peso, taking the value of the currency closer to the levels at which it trades on various informal markets. Bruno Gennari, Argentina expert at fixed income broker dealer KNG Securities, said the peso was trading at $1,009 versus the dollar on crypto exchanges Monday, considerably weaker than the $869 and $975 rates seen on Friday. A former economist and TV pundit who ran for president on a promise to “break the status quo,” Milei made “dollarizing” Argentina a signature campaign promise, hailing it as a cure for the country’s hyperinflation problem. It’s a step that other countries have taken, just none the size of Argentina — Latin America’s third-biggest economy after Brazil and Mexico. Dollarization means Argentina would give up the peso and use the US dollar as its currency, effectively wresting control of monetary policy from the country’s central bank and handing it to the US Federal Reserve. The move would also deprive Argentina’s central bank of the ability to print money — a tactic it has frequently employed to help the country’s spendthrift government avoid defaulting on its debts. That, in turn, fueled rampant price rises. Analysts agree dollarization would help tame inflation. But they doubt Milei has the political or popular support to deliver on this agenda. “We suspect that some of his more radical proposals — namely dollarization — may not materialize, given limited support both in congress and among the public,” William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Monday. While dollarization “would be a surefire way to bring inflation under control, it wouldn’t be a solution to the country’s fiscal woes,” he added. In a sign he may be seeking to gain support from centrist parties, Milei did not mention dollarization or previously mooted plans to shut down the central bank in his victory speech. “It’s not going to happen in the near term,” said Thierry Larose, a portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. Quite apart from the political hurdles, the fragile state of Argentina’s economy leaves it in no position to dollarize, he told CNN, describing it as a “terrible idea.” That’s because as things currently stand, the conversion rate would be highly unfavorable to the peso, drastically weakening the currency and likely leading to an increase in poverty, which government figures already put at around 40%. “If you want to dollarize at (a) conversion rate that makes sense from a social and economic perspective, you need a minimal amount of international reserves,” Larose said. Currently, the government’s foreign exchange reserves are more than $10 billion in the red. The “path towards dollarization,” however, could benefit the economy, Larose added. “In order to dollarize … you need to stabilize (the economy): kill hyperinflation, rebuild foreign exchange reserves,” he said. “You need fiscal consolidation and eventually you need access to capital markets.” That could still be some way off. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has effectively barred Argentina from accessing international markets while the country pays back its debts. Argentina owes the Washington, DC-based lender some $44 billion following a historic bailout in 2018. Kristalina Georgieva, the fund’s managing director, congratulated Milei on his election victory Monday. “We look forward to working closely with him and his administration in the period ahead to develop and implement a strong plan to safeguard macroeconomic stability and strengthen inclusive growth for all Argentinians,” she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Milei will need all the help he can get. The World Bank expects the Argentine economy to contract by 2.5% in 2023, owing in part to a devastating drought that is estimated to cost it $20 billion in lost agricultural exports. What’s more, Jackson, of Capital Economics, expects the IMF to “shift away” from its recent leniency toward Argentina. “It’s not clear if a debt restructuring will be demanded at this point, but we are moving in that direction,” he said. — Valentina Gonzalez, Stefano Pozzebon, Olesya Dmitracova and Reuters contributed reporting.",Markets
A record number of $50 bills were printed last year. It’s not why you think," Unless you’re an avid currency collector, an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, or work at the Federal Reserve, you likely didn’t know that last year a record number of $50 bills were printed. Last year, the government printed 756,096,000 of those bills — the highest total of the denomination printed in one year in more than 40 years. If you put all those $50s together, you’d have about $37.8 billion. That’s enough to afford Taco Bell’s parent Yum Brands, Inc. $35.3 billion market cap. Usually, the $50 bill is an uncommon, somewhat unpopular, denomination. There are even multiple superstitions that it is unlucky. (More on that later.) In 2019, only 3.5% of all US bills printed were $50s. In 2022, that zoomed to 8.5%, according to the BEP. So why are you seeing more $50s? Surprisingly, it has nothing to do with inflation — even if it may sometimes feel these days like an item that used to cost $20 now costs $50. (Luckily, the rate at which inflation has grown slowed to 3.2% in October from its peak of 9.1% last June.) Instead, it all began with the pandemic. People started hoarding cash, the Fed discovered. And it’s easier to squirrel away bigger bills. In July 2021, the Fed noted its “2022 print order is heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic… the Federal Reserve continues to experience unprecedented demand for currency.” A subsequent report from the San Francisco Fed confirmed that, after 2020, Americans began to carry more cash in their wallets, cars, houses and elsewhere. So, the Fed ordered a big uptick in $50s. Until the pandemic, the $50 had been one of the rarest bills ordered for years, save for the $2 bill. But for 2021 and 2022, the Fed ordered up more $50s than $10s and $5s. To understand why so many $50 bills were printed, it’s important to know how the system of printing money works. The Fed doesn’t print any physical money itself; it estimates the anticipated demand for currency and the rate of decay of bills already in circulation. Then, it orders the money from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the government agency that prints paper money. The US Mint produces coins. Few people really love the $50. There’s an old superstition that, because President Ulysses S. Grant is on the face of the $50, and he notoriously went bankrupt, the bills are jinxed. (The $50 bill dates to 1862, but Grant’s face wasn’t added until 1914.) Back in 2010, North Carolina Republican Representative Patrick McHenry even attempted to introduce a measure into Congress to replace 18th President Grant with 40th President Ronald Reagan. The effort got some support but ultimately went nowhere. Professional gamblers and casinos reportedly don’t like to carry the bills, considering them a jinx and partially because Las Vegas casino investor and gangster Bugsy Siegel was rumored to have died with only $50s in his pocket. But, more likely, and more realistically, people tend to avoid using $50 bills due to them being confused with $5 or $20 bills and many stores not accepting bills larger than $20. A surge in demand for physical money amid a lockdown might not make sense at first glance. Especially given that, as Covid-19 set in, businesses across the United States closed their customer-facing storefronts temporarily and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraged the use of cash. But demand for physical cash and actually paying with cash are two separate things, according to analysts at the San Francisco Fed. Economic and geopolitical uncertainty naturally causes unease, prompting many people to hold on to cash that they may not immediately try and spen, they concluded. Their data also shows Americans are using physical cash less in daily purchases, and the amount being held by consumers still remains elevated when compared to before the pandemic. The printing of various denominations has returned to normal levels this year, as shown by the Fed’s 2023 and 2024 print orders. The Fed in its 2023 order said its primary driver now in currency orders is the need to replace damaged notes ($50s last 12.2 years on average, according to the Fed; dollar bills last about half as long.) The Fed placed its 2024 currency order in July, with an anticipated volume of $50 bills in the range of 99,200,000 to 211,200,000 notes, less than one-third of the 2022 printing. But cash holdings for American households remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic times, the San Francisco Fed report shows, noting that consumers “continue to hold a significant amount of cash that may be unlikely to be used for daily purchases.”",Markets
"Falling prices may sound good, but deflation can be dangerous. Here’s why"," After encountering rapid price increases for more than two years, discounts at some stores would certainly feel like a much-needed respite. But business leaders, economists and investment moguls aren’t so gung-ho about it. Tech investor Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Investment Management, told The Wall Street Journal in a story published on Wednesday she’s more worried about deflation, when prices fall, than the inverse — inflation. “We’re seeing more and more signs of it,” she said, referring to deflation. Falling prices of commodities like copper and lumber “negatively impacted” Home Depot’s third-quarter earnings, CEO Ted Decker told investors on the company’s earnings call earlier this week. “As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per thousand board feet compared to approximately $545 in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of over 20%,” Home Depot’s executive vice president of merchandising, Billy Bastek, added on the call. “Big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were down 5.2% compared to the third quarter of last year,” Bastek said. One of the first lessons students learn in Economics 101 is that when the price of a good is higher, people demand less of it. And when the price of a good is lower, people demand more of it. But the problem with deflation is that when people begin to expect lower prices in the future, they have little incentive to make purchases right now. For instance, unless it was absolutely necessary, why would you buy a new oven today if you thought the price would go down significantly in a month? When enough people think that way, it causes massive pullbacks in spending. That can prompt a recession if it means businesses can’t afford to employ as many workers. Deflation is not a problem across the board in the United States, which, like many countries, is experiencing inflation. In China, however, prices across all goods and services were 0.2% lower in October compared to the same month last year. US consumer prices are 3.2% higher compared to a year ago, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. But even though Americans are still paying more for goods and services compared to a year ago, the pace of the increases has slowed significantly. That said, many goods in the United States are a lot cheaper than they were a year ago. For instance, prices for eggs are 22% lower, the second-biggest year-over-year price cut behind health insurance, according to October CPI data. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday consumers could soon encounter more uniform price cuts at grocery stores. He also warned that US-based Walmarts could enter “a deflationary environment.” Besides eggs, other cheaper goods include airfares, gasoline, appliances and smartphones. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, referred to this as “selective deflation.” For now, he said, “it’s helping to push overall inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target with minimal pain in terms of unemployment and lost output.” “In other words, it’s making a soft landing possible,” he told CNN.",Markets
An Alabama mom is pregnant in each of her two uteruses in an extremely rare case of twins," Kelsey Hatcher’s fourth pregnancy started like most others: with a missed period. From there, a home pregnancy test turned positive, and she shared the news with her husband, Caleb, who has always been “the greatest encourager.” The Hatchers, who live in Dora, Alabama, thought they were done with middle-of-the night feedings after their youngest was born in 2021. “When I told him I was pregnant again, he’s like, ‘OK, well, what’s one more? It’ll be great. It’ll be fine,’ ” she said. At her first ultrasound appointment, about eight weeks into her pregnancy, things took an unexpected turn. The ultrasound technician quickly found the baby and told Hatcher everything looked perfect. The baby was healthy. Then Hatcher remembered to tell the tech that her anatomy was a little different. She was born with two uteruses, a condition called uterine didelphys. “So if you’re scanning and maybe catch a glimpse of it or something, don’t think it’s just something random or there’s something wrong. There is a totally separate uterus there,” said Hatcher, 32. Hatcher said the ultrasound tech thanked her for letting her know and said she would just take a quick peek at the second uterus to make sure everything looked good. “And as soon as she moved the ultrasound wand over to the other side of my belly, I said, ‘Oh, my gosh! There’s another one.’ “ Hatcher didn’t even need to be told there was another baby. She could see it herself. “The nurse practitioner that I met with that day, she was just blown away. She said, ‘I’m not even sure what the statistics of this are,’ ” Hatcher recalled. The odds are mind-boggling. About 3.6 million babies were born in the US last year, but only about 114,000 of those births were twins, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In other words, about three sets of twins are born for every 200 live births, according to the CDC, and two of those sets are likely to be fraternal, which means they come from two separate fertilized eggs. Hatcher’s condition is rare, too: About 1 in 2,000 women is born with uterine didelphys. In order for her to become pregnant in both of her uteruses at the same time, two eggs had to be fertilized, one in each uterus. Like most women, Hatcher has two ovaries, the glands that store and release eggs.  Each of her ovaries feeds a single uterus. Typically, ovaries take turns releasing eggs, sending one into the uterus each cycle for a chance at being fertilized. Occasionally, however, an ovary may release more than one egg during each cycle, a phenomenon called hyperovulation. Hyperovulation hasn’t been extensively researched, but one 2006 study of 500 women found that about 1 in 5 of them was able to hyperovulate. But even for those women, it doesn’t happen each cycle. When it does, sometimes a single ovary may release two eggs. And even more infrequently, both ovaries will release a single egg at the same time, which is what happened in Hatcher’s case. Case studies estimate the chances of pregnancy like this – a woman with two uteruses carrying a baby in each one at the same time – at around 1 in 2 billion in the general population, though it’s impossible to know for sure with something this infrequent. Hatcher was about seven times more likely to win a Powerball jackpot and about 131,000 times more likely to get hit by lightning at some point in her life. Uterine didelphys happens in the first weeks of a baby’s development. Females are born with two uterine horns, or halves, that normally fuse to form one larger cavity. With didelphys, the uterine walls don’t fuse as they should, and women are born with two. Hatcher says she got lucky, in a way, because some women with uterine didelphys have only one working uterus; the other can’t support a pregnancy. But her medical records show that she has carried babies in both of hers, just never before at the same time. Even her doctors are playing it by ear. “Even in medical school, we don’t really learn about this because this is such a rare thing,” said Dr. Shweta Patel, who is Hatcher’s obstetrician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Because it’s such an unusual circumstance, we did not have as much guidance for her prenatal care,” Patel said. “We know a lot about how to take care of twin pregnancies in general when there’s one uterus involved, and so extrapolating the patient care for that is what we’ve been doing for Kelsey.” Both babies are girls, and they are growing well. At 34 weeks gestation, they are right on track, Hatcher says. One thing that’s different with this pregnancy, Hatcher says, is that in certain positions, she has not just one baby bump but two. When she lies in her recliner in the evening, “the girls will separate, almost, and you can see vividly the two separate wombs, because there’s a big gap in my stomach where they fall to one side or the other.” The babies are technically twins, but because they don’t share a womb and can’t touch each other, Hatcher has wondered whether they’ll have a bond as some other twins do. “I’m very curious to see how they turn out, as if they’ll have any type of connection like that or if they’ll just be siblings,” she said. Her due date is Christmas, but Hatcher knows it’s not likely that she’ll make it that far, since being pregnant with multiples makes preterm birth more likely. “I’ve moreso just wanted to make it to December,” she said. Hatcher wants to have a vaginal birth, but with two uteruses, it’s unclear how labor and delivery will play out. “I think birth is probably the biggest unknown,” Patel said. The medical team isn’t sure whether both uteruses will begin contracting at the same time or whether the babies will be born separately. Perhaps one side will go into labor, but the other doesn’t, so they might have to induce labor on that side with hormones. Maybe Hatcher will need a c-section. “We won’t know until we see it,” Patel said. In the meantime, Hatcher and her husband have their bags packed, and she’s trying to work as much as possible – she’s a massage therapist – because they need the income. Friends have started a GoFundMe page to help with unexpected expenses, including home renovations, child care and missed income after the twins are born. “Things could go really quickly, and I could go into labor tonight,” Hatcher said. “Or it could take a little while. We’re prepared. We’re ready for at any point. Whenever it happens, it happens.” One thing they have not yet figured out are the girls’ names. Their other three children, two girls and a boy, ages 6, 4 and 2, all have names that start with the letter R, and Hatcher says they plan to stick with that for the twins. Beyond that, nothing is settled. Her son was a little upset at first when he found out that both babies were girls, but now he’s getting excited about being a big brother. She says the rareness of this pregnancy makes it all the more meaningful to them. “There’s no denying the miracle in these babies and knowing that they are here for something great, because for all of that to line up perfectly and it to happen the way that it has, you can’t question that, you know?”",Health
"‘A living hell inside of my head’: For first time, more advanced stage of CTE diagnosed in teen football player"," In July 2019, just months after graduating from high school, 18-year-old Wyatt Bramwell took his own life. About a year later, researchers at Boston University diagnosed him with stage 2 chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, caused by playing tackle football for several years. Wyatt’s mother suspects that he knew what he was doing when he died. “He shot himself in the heart, not the head,” Christie Bramwell said. It was her son’s dying wish to donate his brain to CTE research, and the only way to diagnose the disease is through an autopsy of the brain. In Wyatt’s brain, researchers discovered the first case of stage 2 CTE to be diagnosed in a high school football player, according to Dr. Ann McKee, director of the Boston University CTE Center, who diagnosed Wyatt. The Kansas City, Missouri, teen had the worst brain trauma ever seen in someone so young, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. “This is an example of a person with fairly advanced damage to his brain, given that he only played amateur football and his highest level was high school,” McKee said. Wyatt’s condition was caused by playing tackle football for about 10 years, including four years in high school, McKee says. Bramwell says he started playing flag football at 5 years old and advanced to tackle in the third grade. Bramwell says she knew what CTE was but thought it was only found in older professional football players. She never imagined the disease would alter her life forever. “I thought the worst thing that would ever happen to my kid maybe was a bad tackle. Something broken, something bleeding. That wasn’t the case.” CTE is an Alzheimer’s-like disease that is most commonly associated with former professional football players but has also been detected in military veterans, including many who have been exposed to roadside bombs and other types of blasts. Divided into four stages, CTE is pathologically marked by a buildup of tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways. “It takes years for CTE to progress from stage 1 to stage 2, so to find stage 2 CTE in an 18-year-old is the clearest evidence yet that we are giving children CTE in sports,” McKee said in a statement from the Concussion Legacy Foundation. “I hope this inspires further CTE prevention efforts, including adoption of CTE Prevention Protocols in sports.” Wyatt had several CTE lesions – clusters of tau inside nerve cells – scattered throughout his brain, McKee says. “In stage 1 CTE, there are usually only one or two of these CTE lesions,” she said. “But in his brain, there were lesions found in multiple regions in the frontal cortex, in the temporal cortex and in something called the medial temporal lobe.” These parts of the brain play an important role in how we manage our memory, emotions and body movements, she noted. “In stage 2 CTE, we do generally see more severe behavioral and mood changes,” she said. “And I think he talked about a number of those.” “My life for the past four years has been a living hell inside of my head,” Wyatt says in a video he recorded just before his death and sent to his family and friends. He adds that he had struggled with depression, racing thoughts and paranoia. Wyatt’s story – along with those of several other athletes who died young and were later diagnosed with CTE – was first featured in the New York Times. Bramwell says she did not notice any changes to her son’s personality until a few months before his death. He had become more rebellious and defiant, but she chalked it up to him being an “18-year-old young man getting ready to go to college.” Wyatt’s parents don’t know for certain whether he did research about CTE, but his mother says he knew what the diagnosis was. She believes he was steadfast in his decision to end his life and says he seemed certain that CTE was to blame for his mental health struggles. “He knew what he was doing at that moment,” Bramwell said. “I feel like it’s part of his legacy.” Previous studies have shown that repetitive hits to the head – even without a concussion – can result in CTE, which has been associated with memory loss, confusion, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, impaired judgment and suicidal behavior. “I took a lot of hits through football,” Wyatt says in the video. “I took a lot of concussions, and a lot of times I never told anybody about how I was feeling in my head after a hit.” But it’s hard to say whether Wyatt’s symptoms were related to the disease or other factors, McKee says. “He was concerned about having CTE, but I think at this point, it is still unclear what the relationship is between CTE and suicide,” she said. Wyatt was included in a study of 152 athletes who died before the age of 30 that was published this year in the journal JAMA Neurology. Researchers found that 87 of the brain donors died by suicide, including 33 who had CTE. But that finding may not hold any significance, McKee previously told CNN. “The most common cause of death across the board, whether they had CTE or not, was suicide, followed by accidental overdose,” she said, noting that suicide is one of the leading causes of death among younger people. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14 and ages 20 to 34. Someone who suspects that they might have CTE and is having feelings of sadness and depression should seek medical attention immediately, McKee says, because those things can be treated with medication and therapy. McKee also notes that the longer someone can avoid playing a contact sport, the better, because research suggests that with football, in particular, the risk of developing CTE doubles every 2.6 years. Bill Bramwell, Wyatt’s dad, told the Concussion Legacy Foundation, “Knowing what I know now, I would have encouraged Wyatt to play flag football for much longer.” But Wyatt’s mother says she would not have stopped her son from playing the sport he loved. “It’s what he wanted to do,” Bramwell said. “I couldn’t take that from him. I couldn’t take those memories away, because he loved football so much.”",Health
"Death, preterm labor reported in Listeria outbreak linked to recalled peaches, plums, nectarines"," Eleven cases of Listeria infection have been reported in seven states in an outbreak linked with peaches, plums and nectarines, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. One person died, and a pregnant person who became ill went into early labor. Three cases were reported in both California and Florida, with other cases reported in Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. However, the CDC says the number of cases is probably higher because some people with Listeria infections get better without medical care, so their illnesses aren’t reported. Testing showed that HMC Farms peaches were contaminated with Listeria that’s closely related to the bacteria from some of those sickened in this outbreak. HMC Farms has recalled peaches, plums and nectarines sold in stores between May 1 and November 15 last year and this year. The stone fruit was sold individually and in 2-pound bags. The CDC advises anyone who has recalled fruit to throw it out and clean surfaces and containers that may have touched the fruit, including inside your refrigerator, since Listeria can survive there. Listeria is more likely to cause severe illness in people who are pregnant, who have weakened immune systems or who are 65 or older. Get medical care if you have symptoms of a Listeria infection such as fever, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or seizures. The CDC is also continuing its investigation into another recent illness-related fruit recall. At least 43 illnesses have been reported in a salmonella outbreak linked with whole and pre-cut cantaloupes. Trufresh, Vinyard and Aldi products are included in the recall.",Health
Even more free home Covid-19 tests are available for order from the US government," US households are now eligible to order an additional four at-home Covid-19 tests — free of cost — through the government. As of Monday, residential households in the US can submit an order through Covidtests.gov for four individual rapid antigen Covid-19 tests. Orders will start to ship on November 27, according to USPS. People without an internet connection can call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to request tests. The US government had suspended the rapid test distribution program earlier in May, then reopened it in September. Residents who haven’t placed an order since the program reopened can place two orders, which will provide eight tests in total, according to USPS. Covid-19 rapid tests can be taken at home and can be used regardless of whether someone has symptoms. The tests should work through the end of the year; some of the dates on the tests may show that they are expired, but the US Food and Drug Administration has extended those dates. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people test if they have any Covid-19-like symptoms including a sore throat, runny nose, loss of smell or taste, or a fever. People may also want to test before they are going to be a part of a large event, like a concert or a conference, particularly if people are not up-to-date on their vaccines. Antivirals are available to treat Covid-19 and flu, and testing can help determine which medication is needed. Covid-19 hospital admissions and emergency department visits are once again on the rise after a few weeks of downturn, according to the CDC. For the week ending November 11, the percentage of Covid-related emergency department visits was 1.4%, or just over 16,200 people — similar to rates seen throughout this month and last month. Overall, outpatient visits for flu-like illness are lower than they were at this time last year but higher than in the previous four seasons. CDC forecasting suggests that this respiratory virus season will result in about the same number of hospitalizations as last season. Seasonal flu activity is also increasing in most parts of the country with flu-like activity labeled as high in New Mexico, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina, according to the CDC. There have been at least 780,000 illnesses, 8,000 hospitalizations, and 490 deaths from flu so far this season, the agency estimates. More than a third of adults and nearly a third of children have gotten their flu shot this year, CDC data shows. About 14% of adults and 5% of children have gotten the new Covid-19 vaccine while 14% of older adults ages 60 and up have gotten the new RSV vaccine. CNN’s Jen Christensen and Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.",Health
"Births have increased in states with abortion bans, research finds"," Nearly a quarter of people seeking an abortion in the United States were unable to get one due to bans that took effect after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, researchers estimate. In the first half of 2023, states with abortion bans had an average fertility rate that was 2.3% higher than states where abortion was not restricted, according to the analysis – leading to about 32,000 more births than expected. The findings are based on preliminary births data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research has not yet been peer-reviewed but experts say the data paints a clear picture about the direct impact of abortion restrictions. “It’s an assault on reproductive autonomy,” said Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but has published research on the effect that a strict abortion law had on births in Texas. “We don’t always detect signals in these population aggregates because there’s a lot of variation when you group everybody together. The fact that there is a signal at the population level means that something’s really going on. It’s pretty strong evidence.” Fertility rates – the number of births per women of reproductive age – don’t typically change dramatically. A “shock” like Covid-19, for example, led to a “temporary baby bust,” said Gemmill, who has also researched infertility during the pandemic. The 4.5% decrease in fertility rate in the first year of the pandemic was the largest in decades, according to CDC data. Other research has found that the number of abortions increased nationwide in the year following the Dobbs decision, with especially large increases in states that border those with bans. But complete data on the number of abortions provided to people who crossed states lines for their care is not yet available, and the new research suggests that travel remains a significant barrier to access. After the Dobbs decision, fertility rates increased most significantly in states with longer travel times to the nearest abortion providers, the new research found, including a 5.1% increase in Texas and a 4.4% increase in Mississippi. Abortions have been trending up in the US for years. But rising birth rates could indicate that unmet need persists, despite an increase in the number of abortions in the year post-Dobbs. “One might think that those data conflict,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco’s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but is co-chair of the #WeCount project that tracks abortion trends. “But in actuality, we’ve known that there are many people who still can’t get abortions.” While some people may have been able to travel out of banned states for an abortion, abortions are likely also increasing among residents of states where it remains legal as additional resources and support help to address unmet need that existed even before Roe v. Wade was overturned, she said. Earlier research has found that there are many consequences of unintended birth, affecting the health and livelihood of the mother, the child and the family in general. And the new research found that abortion bans have especially affected Hispanic women, with a 4.7% increase in fertility rate in the first half of 2023, as well as younger women, with a 3.3% increase among those in their early 20s. “Restricted access to abortion services causes this domino effect,” said Rachel Hardeman, a professor of health and racial equity at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the new research. People who do not have the resources to overcome additional barriers, such as costly travel to an out-of-state provider, may then have less opportunity to build long-term financial security. “[The Dobbs decision] has had a profound impact on birthing people’s ability to decide what their family looks like and how they navigate that,” she said. “All of the material resources necessary for a family to not just barely survive, but to thrive in our society are going to be impacted by their ability to access health care, broadly speaking, and abortion care, specifically.” Not all people who seek an abortion have an unwanted pregnancy, experts say. Some are wanted pregnancies with fetal abnormalities or other life-threatening conditions – and some of the increase in births likely includes unviable pregnancies that were carried to term. “Infant mortality is one of these more concrete consequences that we can measure right now, and we are seeing impacts there,” Gemmill said. In Texas, for example, infant mortality increased about 12% in 2022, including a 22% spike in infant deaths caused by severe genetic and birth defects. “I think about these women that had to carry these gestations and give birth to them, knowing that they were likely going to die shortly after birth and the trauma related to that,” Gemmill said. “We’re just going to be learning more and more about the consequences.”",Health
"After more reports of illnesses from recalled applesauce pouches, FDA is screening cinnamon shipments for lead"," After more reports of illnesses potentially linked to lead in recalled fruit and applesauce pouches, the US Food and Drug Administration says that it is screening shipments of cinnamon from multiple countries for possible lead contamination. So far, no illnesses or elevated blood lead levels have been reported for other cinnamon or products containing the popular holiday spice. There have been 34 reports of illnesses linked to apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches sold under the WanaBanana, Weis and Schnucks brands, the FDA said Friday — a dozen more cases since an update on Monday. Cases have been identified in at least 22 states, and the agency says it’s continuing to evaluate incoming reports of illnesses. The FDA, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local partners have been investigating reports of high blood lead levels in children who consumed the pouches, which were manufactured in Ecuador. In one product sample of a WanaBana Apple Cinnamon Puree from Dollar Tree, the level detected was 2.18 parts per million, the agency said — more than 200 times greater than the action level FDA had proposed in previous draft guidance for products intended for babies and young children. “FDA’s leading hypothesis is that cinnamon used in these recalled pouches is the likely source of contamination for these products,” the agency said in its update on Friday, although it hasn’t yet been able to test samples of the cinnamon used in the products. “At this time, FDA has no indication that this issue extends beyond these recalled products, but to further protect public health, FDA is screening incoming shipments of cinnamon from multiple countries for lead contamination.” This week, the CDC warned doctors to be on the lookout for children who may have been exposed to lead in the fruit pouches. The pouches were sold at retailers including Amazon, Dollar Tree and Sam’s Club, as well as Schnucks and Weis stores. Families should not eat or serve the products. They should be thrown away or taken back to the store for a refund, the FDA has said. Caregivers should take any children who may have eaten these products to have blood tests to check for exposure to lead. Lead is toxic to humans, and there is no safe level. Exposure is not typically apparent right away, but it can cause developmental delays in children. Initial symptoms of lead poisoning may include head, stomach and muscle aches, vomiting, anemia, irritability, fatigue and weight loss. CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.",Health
"As holiday season gets underway, here’s how to protect yourself and your family from respiratory viruses"," With Thanksgiving just days away, people across the United States are finalizing travel plans or racing through grocery stores in search of the perfect turkey, but there’s another plan to consider ahead of the holiday season: how to stay healthy and avoid the mix of seasonal viruses in circulation. Flu cases continue to pick up in most parts of the country, particularly the South and the West, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus are also spreading as many Americans hit the road and take to the skies this week, noted Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California at San Francisco — and they’ll be touching common surfaces that may be contaminated and sharing air with infected people. “A lot of people are going to be traveling at record numbers for Thanksgiving and the holiday period,” he said. “That means that risk is going to be mixed in from all around the country.” While navigating a sea of strangers may seem intimidating for the health-conscious, experts say there are a number of familiar precautions you can take to keep from catching an illness from fellow travelers or out-of-town visitors this year. Some Americans have continued to wear masks well into 2023, but many cast the practice aside as local jurisdictions eased Covid-19 guidelines. However, Chin-Hong said that wearing a mask on public transport and at the airport is still one of the best things you can do to prevent the spread of disease. “I know we think about masking as something that people do when they don’t want to get [sick], but if you have mild symptoms, wearing a mask is actually going to prevent other people from getting what you have, even if it’s a common cold,” he said. Masking is also key in areas with limited ventilation and airflow, such as the stuffy jet bridges that passengers stand in while waiting to board a flight. Chin-Hong adds that masks should also be worn on flights, even if there is good ventilation, as an added layer of protection from people who are coughing and sneezing. When it comes to Thanksgiving dinner or meeting up with old friends, try to avoid gathering in crowded spaces, Chin-Hong recommends. “The hole-in-the-wall bar is going to be a little bit riskier,” he said. “But if you sit by the window, that’s going to be less risky.” Handwashing is also a good habit to practice during the holidays, Chin-Hong said. If soap and water aren’t available, a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can kill many germs, according to the CDC. It’s also a good rule of thumb to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to avoid spreading germs. In theory, Chin-Hong said, the only way to make sure you don’t pick up a virus while traveling for the holidays is to not travel at all, but that’s not a reality for most Americans. About 55 million people are expected to travel between the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after the holiday, AAA forecasts. Nearly 3 million people are expected to hit airports nationwide on the Sunday after Thanksgiving alone, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Not everyone will be flying, however. A majority of Americans — more than 49 million — will be driving to their destinations. Chin-Hong said some people may see this as a safer alternative to milling about an airport or sitting on an airplane, but a car is still an enclosed space. “People let their guard down because they know somebody, but of course, the virus doesn’t care if you’re related to the person,” he said. “I got Covid last Thanksgiving, and it was from a relative. They were visiting, and I let my guard down. I didn’t think of them as a stranger on the street.” Chin-Hong said many Americans have become nonchalant about circulating viruses. In fact, about three-quarters of adults say they are “not too worried” or “not at all worried” about getting Covid-19 over the holidays, according to a new survey from KFF, and two-thirds say they are not worried about spreading the virus to people close to them. If you’re worried about spreading a virus, Chin-Hong said that testing — whether for Covid-19, the flu or RSV — is a good option that should be utilized more often, especially if you’re headed to visit young, elderly or at-risk relatives, such as those with compromised immune systems or pregnant people. “It’s hard to go by symptoms alone,” he said. “Getting a test is an important way to distinguish what’s happening, particularly for flu and Covid. It’s important for those at risk, because you can get early therapy that can shorten the course [of the virus] or prevent hospitalization.” For the first time, there are vaccines available to protect against Covid-19, influenza and RSV, and now is the time for everyone eligible to get vaccinated, experts stress. Everyone 6 months and older should get Covid-19 and flu shots, the CDC recommends. Both are available now at retail pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens, and you can even get them at the same time. Ideally, Chin-Hong said, very young children should have gotten their flu shot last month. Even if parents have not received their own flu shot, at the very least, they should get their child vaccinated. “Kids actually have a very high rate of doing poorly with flu,” he said. RSV is another dangerous virus for young children and infants. Nirsevimab, marketed as Beyfortus, is a long-acting monoclonal antibody injection to protect infants against severe illness related to RSV. Although doses are in short supply, the CDC announced Thursday that more than 77,000 additional doses will be distributed “immediately” to doctor’s offices and hospitals. For people 60 and older, there are also two vaccines for RSV, and the CDC is encouraging people to get them as soon as possible. The vaccines are also available at pharmacy chains and other retailers, and at local health clinics. Staying up to date on vaccinations can help take a load off hospitals, many of which were overwhelmed with RSV, flu and Covid-19 last year, Chin-Hong said. Make sure you have cold and flu medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen, “particularly for kids,” he said, because many of those medications were in short supply due to overwhelming demand last winter. In most parts of the country, seasonal flu activity is increasing once again after taking a backseat during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the CDC, flu-like activity was high in Puerto Rico and several Southern US states for the week ending November 11, with Louisiana reporting very high flu activity. During this week, 3.5% of health care visits were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat. Meanwhile, Western states like Alaska, New Mexico, California and Texas are seeing more cases, according to CDC data. More than a third of US adults and nearly a third of children have gotten their flu shot this year, the CDC said. By comparison, about 14% of adults and 5% of children have gotten the new Covid-19 vaccine, and about 14% of older adults 60 and up have gotten the new RSV vaccine. Overall, outpatient visits for flu-like illness are lower than they were at this time last year but higher than in the previous four seasons. Covid-19 hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and test positivity are all trending down, CDC data shows. For the week ending November 11, the percentage of Covid-related emergency department visits was 1.4%, or just over 16,200 people – similar to rates seen throughout this month and last month. The last time we saw a “significant” spike in flu activity was about a year ago, Chin-Hong notes, “so a lot of immunity has gone away, whereas we’ve had successive waves of Covid,” in the past year, he said. Even though Covid-19 is trending down at the moment, it’s still a virus to keep in mind, since it continues to cause serious illness and death, Chin-Hong said, noting that he expects to see another spike in the new year. “There are things that we can’t always predict, and I think it’s good to be humble about all of these viruses and how they work and when they peak,” he said.

Get headaches from drinking red wine? Study offers clue about why," Scientists may be closer to understanding the culprit behind the consumption of red wine causing headaches for some people, according to new research. A flavonol naturally occurring in red wines may interfere with the body’s ability to metabolize alcohol, causing an accumulation of toxins that can lead to swift headaches, suggests the study published Monday in the journal Scientific Reports. Quercetin, the flavonol, is a plant compound found in fruits and vegetables including grapes, berries, onions and broccoli. “When (quercetin) gets in your bloodstream, your body converts it to a different form called quercetin glucuronide,” said study coauthor Andrew Waterhouse, a wine chemist and professor emeritus in the department of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis, in a news release. “In that form, it blocks the metabolism of alcohol.” Red wine has a tenfold higher amount of phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, than white wine, which makes the beverage a “primary contender responsible” for headaches, the authors said. Waterhouse and the other researchers aimed to uncover why headaches after imbibing just one or two glasses of red wine can even happen to people who don’t get headaches from other alcoholic beverages — so they studied how the flavonol may affect a genetic variant of an enzyme called ALDH2 that’s involved in the body’s metabolism of alcohol. Nearly 8% of the global population has a variant of the enzyme that isn’t particularly active, and the deficiency is highly prevalent among people of East Asian descent — affecting around 40% of this population. Having a dysfunctional ALDH2 variant has been associated with skin flushing, heart palpitations and headaches after drinking. When people drink, the alcohol is broken down in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which turns it into the compound acetaldehyde — a “well-known toxin, irritant and inflammatory substance,” said lead study author Dr. Apramita Devi, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of viticulture and enology at UC Davis. The presence of acetaldehyde in the body is supposed to be short-lived since the enzyme ALDH2 transforms it into acetate, which is less toxic. Using lab tests, the authors found that a derivative of quercetin — quercetin glucuronide — inhibited the enzyme variant. The interference, they hypothesized, would lead to a buildup of the toxin acetaldehyde — and headaches — in people who are more susceptible. But experts who were not involved in the research urge caution, characterizing the study as a proposition of a theory rather than proof. “The study was only done in a lab, and the substances were tested outside the human body in concentrations several times higher than that in blood after a few glasses of wine,” said Dr. Jonas Spaak, an associate professor of cardiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, via email. This kind of research can generate ideas about the potential processes involved in the relationship between red wine and headaches, he added, but “ideally, the researchers should have included samples and tests from humans to verify this mechanism.” Doing so is especially important since, in natural contexts in the human body, the quercetin derivative the authors used is something generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, said Dr. Vasilis Vasiliou, chair of the department of environmental health sciences at Yale University. Neither Spaak nor Vasiliou were involved in the new study. The authors plan to test their hypothesis in a small clinical trial of people who develop these headaches, by comparing red wines with high amounts of quercetin with those that have little. “It is important also to mention that all alcohol consumption (is) for enjoyment only, and that there (is) no solid evidence for any positive health effects (of) red wine or alcohol, but solid evidence for dose-related harm,” Spaak said. “If you drink, do so in moderation.” To minimize headaches, you can also experiment and try wines made by a variety of producers and grape varieties since the “levels of compounds that may trigger headache in red wine vary substantially between different wines,” he added. Quercetin is produced by grapes in response to sunlight, Waterhouse said. “If you grow grapes with the clusters exposed, such as they do in the Napa Valley for their cabernets, you get much higher levels of quercetin. In some cases, it can be four to five times higher.” As a result, you may have better luck with cheaper red wines or with white wines, which have a lower flavonol content overall, according to the study.",Health
How to share a meal without sharing germs? A doctor explains," As people gather for Thanksgiving, they might be bringing along some unexpected guests. These get-togethers are occurring as respiratory viruses such as influenza are on the rise, and Covid-19 and the respiratory syncytial virus are circulating as well. Additionally, there are also foodborne illnesses going around that can result in stomach upset and other symptoms. How can people protect themselves as they’re preparing for holiday gatherings? What should hosts keep in mind as they are planning events and serving food? And what symptoms are signs a person should seek medical care? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, with responsibilities that included overseeing infectious diseases as well as food safety. CNN: What types of illnesses can be transmitted during Thanksgiving and other holiday get-togethers? Dr. Leana Wen: I’d think about the illnesses in two categories. The first is respiratory illnesses, like the flu, RSV and the common cold. Someone who is infected coughs or sneezes, then those droplets containing viruses land on your nose or mouth. Or they touch their nose, then touch a surface, and then you touch that surface and then your nose or mouth. Some viruses, like the virus that causes Covid-19, are also airborne, and can be transmitted by someone who is coughing, singing or just speaking and breathing near you. The second category is foodborne infections. These are also quite common. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illnesses each year. The most common pathogen implicated in these infections is norovirus. This can be spread through food and drink and can also be spread from person. If you touch an object that an infected person touched, and then touch your mouth, you could get norovirus. You could also contract it by eating from the same utensils or drinking from the same cup as an infected person. A subcategory under foodborne infections are infections that result from ingesting the food itself — for example, if it’s undercooked or spoiled. Such pathogens include salmonella and E. coli. CNN: How should people decide what level of precautions to take? Wen: Most people don’t want to get sick, of course, but some people need to take extra precautions because they are vulnerable to severe illness. Older people, babies and very young children, pregnant individuals, and those who are immunocompromised or have other serious underlying medical conditions all fall into this category. They should take additional precautions based on how much they wish to avoid infection. For instance, they may wish to avoid very large gatherings in indoor crowded spaces and instead opt for get-togethers with a small group of family and friends who have taken steps to limit their own virus risks in the preceding week. They may choose to spend most of their time together in well-ventilated spaces. While traveling to the event, and in other public spaces, they could wear well-fitting N95s or equivalent masks. And, of course, they should be sure that they have their recommended vaccines and access to antiviral treatment if they were to become ill. CNN: What should hosts keep in mind as they are planning events? Wen: Hosts should check in with their guests to see whether any of them are in this category of individuals who are very vulnerable and wishing to take extra precautions. If so, they could have a discussion of what additional steps should be taken to reduce risk. For instance, could doors and windows be open during meals? Could there be instructions encouraging people not to attend if they have symptoms? Could hosts suggest that everyone take a rapid Covid-19 test prior to arrival? Could hosts place sanitizer throughout the event and encourage frequent use? Any of these steps could help reduce the risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal illness. CNN: Are buffet tables a good idea? Wen: Buffet tables could add a bit more risk for three reasons, but there are ways to reduce the risk with some planning. First, people often congregate near a buffet. A lot of people in a tight space adds to the risk of person-to-person spread. Hosts could ask a few people to get food one at a time and then sit down instead of congregating. They can also open windows and doors. Second, buffets generally have a lot of items that are touched by numerous people, like serving spoon, pitchers and lids. Knowing that this is the case, hosts can place hand sanitizer at the end of the buffet line and at dining spaces to encourage people to use it after helping themselves at the buffet and before eating. Third, buffets often involve food that’s lying out for a long time. Depending on the type of food, it could be out for too long and then become a breeding ground for various pathogens. Hosts should be attentive to the amount of time perishable food is out — generally, perishable items should not be left out for more than two hours. Remember the old maxim: Hot food should be kept hot, and cold food should be kept cold. CNN: Is it better to forgo buffets in favor of plated meals? Wen: If the steps above can be followed, buffets may be no riskier than plated meals. However, if many people are likely to congregate near a buffet table, for instance, hosts can plate meals for their more vulnerable guests and have them dine in a less crowded area with open windows and good air circulation. CNN: What other food safety tips can help to reduce the spread of illnesses? Wen: Don’t undercook meat. There are excellent resources online that outline what internal temperatures different kinds of meat and poultry should be cooked to. Be conscious of what containers and utensils have touched raw meat. Don’t put vegetables that you intend to serve as salad items or cooked meat into these containers. And be sure to wash vegetables and fruit before serving. People who are preparing food should take extra care to wash their hands very well. If they touched raw meat, they need to wash their hands with hot water and soap before handling other food. Everyone should practice good hygiene with frequent handwashing. CNN: Finally, what symptoms should people watch out for — how do they know when they need to seek medical care? Wen: Symptoms of respiratory illnesses include fever, cough, sneezing and body aches. Symptoms of gastrointestinal illnesses include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Those with foodborne infections can also develop body aches and flu-like symptoms, too. People should seek medical care if they have shortness of breath, severe abdominal pain, or are vomiting so much they cannot keep down fluids. This is especially true for people vulnerable to severe illness. And those who have symptoms should stay away from others to reduce their chance of further spreading infections.",Health
"Covid-19 vaccination rate is ‘lower than we’d like to see,’ CDC says"," Respiratory virus season is ramping up across the United States, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that low vaccination rates are leaving many at risk. About 15% of adults and 5% of children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data through mid-November. “Here’s the bottom line: COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower than we’d like to see, and most people will be without the added protection that can reduce the severity of COVID-19,” the agency wrote in an update on its website Friday. Covid-19 hospitalizations are on the rise again, with more than 16,000 new admissions during the week ending November 11. Hospitalization rates are lower than they were at this time last year but nearly three times higher than they were during this summer’s record low. There are a number of reasons why it’s important for people to get the latest Covid-19 vaccine, CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told CNN. “This Covid virus has changed, and you want the most updated Covid vaccine to protect you as we go into this winter season,” she said. “Second, we know that the protection that you get from either having Covid before or being vaccinated before decreases over time.” Vaccination can also help reduce the risk for long Covid, she said. Flu and RSV levels are also increasing, but most respiratory virus hospitalizations this season have been among people with Covid-19, CDC data shows. About a third of adults and children have gotten their flu shot this season, and about 14% of older adults have gotten the new RSV vaccine. “COVID-19 is still an important cause of hospitalization and death, especially for older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions,” the CDC wrote in the latest online update. “COVID-19 vaccines don’t prevent every infection – that’s true of lots of vaccines – but they can reduce illness severity in people who get vaccinated but still get sick, helping to save lives, reduce hospitalizations, and prevent trips to the doctor.” This winter’s respiratory virus season is just beginning, and now is a “great time” to get vaccinated, Cohen said. “The sooner the better. It does take about two weeks for your body to build up the maximum amount of antibodies, but it’s never too late.” The current Covid-19 vaccination rate is significantly higher among seniors, but more than two-thirds of this high-risk population has not gotten the latest vaccine, according to the CDC. “Because older people are much more likely to get hospitalized and die from COVID-19, it is critical that this population get vaccinated to protect themselves against severe outcomes from COVID-19,” the CDC wrote. The CDC also found racial and ethnic disparities in Covid-19 vaccination rates, with uptake about half as high among Black and Hispanic adults compared with White adults. However, separate survey data from KFF found that Black and Hispanic adults are much more likely than White adults to say they have gotten the new vaccine or plan to do so. Overall, the KFF survey found that most adults in the US are not worried about getting sick with Covid-19 or spreading it over the holidays. Only about half say they plan to get the latest vaccine, and there’s a similar split around plans to take other precautions, such as masking or avoiding crowded places and travel.",Health
"Another study links ultraprocessed foods to cancer, but questions remain"," Eating a greater amount of ultraprocessed food was associated with a higher risk of developing cancers of the upper digestive tract, such as mouth, throat and esophageal cancer, according to a new study. In the United States, a 2019 study estimated some 71% of the food supply may be ultraprocessed. People who consumed 10% more ultraprocessed foods than others in the study had a 23% higher risk of head and neck cancer and a 24% higher risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that grows in the glands that line the insides of organs, researchers found. “This study adds to a growing pool of evidence suggesting a link between UPFs (ultraprocessed foods) and cancer risk,” said Dr. Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at World Cancer Research Fund International, which funded the study, in a statement. Much more research and data collection are needed to understand the link the new report found, said study coauthor Dr. Ingre Huybrechts, a nutritional epidemiologist in the Nutrition and Metabolism Branch at the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which helped sponsor the study. The dietary data was collected in the 1990s, “when the consumption of UPFs was still relatively low,” Huybrechts said. “As such, associations may potentially be stronger in cohorts including recent dietary follow-up assessments.” Ultraprocessed foods — such as sodas, chips, nuggets, packaged soups, ice cream and more — contain ingredients “never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,” according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. The new study, published Tuesday in the European Journal of Nutrition, analyzed diet and lifestyle data, including questions on ultraprocessed food consumption, on 450,111 adults who were participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, or EPIC. One of the largest such studies in Europe, EPIC recruited participants between 1992 and 1999 from 23 centers across 10 European countries and the United Kingdom. Being overweight or obese is a well-known risk factor for developing at least 13 types of cancer, including cancer of the esophagus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ultraprocessed foods are often calorie-dense and are considered to be a driver of excess weight, experts say. After performing statistical analysis on the results, however, researchers found increases in body fat accounted for only some of the statistical association between ultraprocessed food and cancers of the upper digestive tract over a 14-year period. An increased waist-to-hip ratio only explained 5% of the 23% higher risk for head and neck cancer, according to the study. An increase of body mass index, or BMI, explained 13% of the 24% additional risk for esophageal cancer, while waist-to-hip ratio explained 15%. “In other words, if UPFs contribute to cancer risk, they do it to a small extent by contributing to obesity, and to a much larger extent by other mechanisms,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who was not involved in the study. “What might those be? Diet-induced inflammation; disruption of the microbiome; adverse epigenetic effects; and many other possibilities come to mind,” said Katz in an email. Katz founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. It’s possible that ingredients such as emulsifiers, preservatives, artificial sweeteners and toxins found in food packaging might also play a role in the link between ultraprocessed food and cancer or other diseases, the study authors said. Oddly, the study also found a link between ultraprocessed food and accidental deaths, which was being used as a control for the study. “The researchers used accidental death as a ‘negative control,’ i.e. something with which UPFs should not be associated if only direct impacts were being tallied,” Katz said in an email. “UPFs were, however, associated with a higher rate of accidental death — suggesting that UPFs are a marker for adverse circumstances in general. Among the factors that might contribute to this association are poverty, discrimination, environmental blight and so on.” Therefore, it’s not clear just what is behind the link, said study coauthor Dr. George Davey Smith, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Bristol in the UK. “UPFs are clearly associated with many adverse health outcomes, yet whether they actually cause these, or whether underlying factors such as general health-related behaviours and socioeconomic position are responsible for the link, is still unclear,” he said in a statement. This is not the first study to find a link between ultraprocessed food and cancer. An August 2022 study found eating ultraprocessed foods significantly increased men’s risk of colorectal cancer as well as a higher risk of heart disease and early death in both men and women. A study published in January found each 10% increase in ultraprocessed food consumption was associated with a 2% increase in developing any cancer — and a 19% increased risk for being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Another recently published study using EPIC data found eating higher amounts of ultraprocessed food raised the risk of being diagnosed with multimorbidity, which is having multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In that study, eating more ultraprocessed animal products and sweetened beverages explained a good part of the association. Another 2023 study found eating greater amounts of ultraprocessed food and drinks, especially if those items are artificially sweetened, could be linked to the development of depression in women. Eating 400 calories a day of ultraprocessed food as part of a 2,000-calorie diet increased the risk for dementia, according to a 2022 study.",Health
"People taking ADHD medications should closely monitor their heart health, study suggests"," Long-term use of ADHD medications can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease in both children and adults, according to a study published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry. Experts say that the benefits of treatment still outweigh the risks for many, but heart heath should be carefully considered and monitored when making individual decisions. Researchers in Sweden followed the medical records of thousands of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder — known as ADHD — for an average of four years, and up to 14 years, between 2007 and 2020. The patients, ages 6 to 64, were monitored for a range of cardiovascular disease diagnoses. The researchers found that people taking ADHD medications had a higher risk of hypertension and arterial disease, and the risk increased over time. Each additional year of ADHD medication use elevated the risk of heart disease by an average of 4%, stabilizing after more substantial increases in the first three years of treatment. Overall, the results suggest that heart disease risk was 23% higher for people who have used ADHD medication for more than five years compared with those who did not take medication — but that’s lower than previously reported findings. Careful attention to the heart health of patients with ADHD is not new, experts say. Earlier research has found that adults with ADHD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease overall. And stimulants, which are commonly prescribed to treat ADHD, are known to elevate blood pressure as arousal to the nervous system makes the heart work harder. Heart disease is so rare in children that pediatricians can often manage younger ADHD patients without the involvement of a cardiologist, said Dr. Mitch Elkind, chief clinical science officer for the American Heart Association. Children with specific concerns based on their medical history and adults with underlying risk factors may benefit a more cautious approach to use of ADHD medication, but there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. “It’s really a balancing act,” he said. About 1 in 10 children ages 3 to 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And diagnoses are becoming more common among adults. Patients should be aware of the risks associated with ADHD medications, but not alarmed, experts say. “When we get into clinical practice, these changes are relatively insignificant in ordinarily healthy adults,” said Dr. David Goodman, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “You need to measure the benefit of the treatment against the relatively small risks, and patients will say benefits are tremendous and I wouldn’t want to give this up.” Goodman, who is also on the executive board of the American Professional Society for ADHD and Related Disorders, is part of a steering committee that is developing the first published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ADHD in adults, and the group plans to address the best practices for assessing and monitoring cardiovascular risk in that documentation. “I don’t want to minimize this,” he said, highlighting the importance of screening for heart health in ADHD patients before starting treatment and checking in regularly. “But if an adult comes in with hypertension and they’re on medication for that, I would still treat them with stimulant medication and just be more mindful to monitor the blood pressure and pulse,” he said. “I have patients in their early 80s on stimulant medications who would tell you, ‘I would not like you to stop prescribing medication because you’re concerned about my high blood pressure.’” ADHD patients can monitor and care for their own heart health using the American Heart Association’s “Life’s Essential 8,” a set of key health behaviors and factors that can affect an individual’s risk for heart disease. “I would say that keeping blood pressure under control is the most important one for somebody on a stimulant,” Elkind said. “Also keeping track of blood sugar and cholesterol levels, eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, getting enough sleep.” The risk for cardiovascular disease may be underestimated in the new study, the researchers wrote, as some heart disease that does not yet require medical care may not be diagnosed. And some patients who did not take their medication as prescribed could skew results. While the study was not able to prove that ADHD medications caused heart disease, the findings “highlight the importance of carefully weighing potential benefits and risks when making treatment decisions on long-term ADHD medication use.” “Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring patients, particularly among those receiving higher doses, and consistently assess signs and symptoms of (cardiovascular disease) throughout the course of treatment,” the researchers wrote.",Health
Ultraprocessed foods now account for two-thirds of calories in the diets of children and teens," Children and teens in the United States now get more than two-thirds of their calories from ultraprocessed foods, an analysis of almost two decades worth of data has found. Ultraprocessed foods – such as frozen pizza, microwave meals, packaged snacks and desserts – accounted for 67% of calories consumed in 2018, up from 61% in 1999, according to research published in the medical journal JAMA Tuesday. The study analyzed the diet of 33,795 children and adolescents nationwide. While industrial processing can keep food fresher longer and allow some foods to be fortified with vitamins, it modifies food to change its consistency, taste and color to make it more palatable, cheap and convenient – using processes that aren’t used in home-cooked meals. They are also aggressively marketed by the food industry. “Some whole grain breads and dairy foods are ultra-processed, and they’re healthier than other ultra-processed foods,” said senior author Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition and cancer epidemiologist at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston. “But many ultra-processed foods are less healthy, with more sugar and salt, and less fiber, than unprocessed and minimally processed foods, and the increase in their consumption by children and teenagers is concerning.” The information on children’s diets used in the study was collected annually by trained interviewers who asked the children or an adult acting on their behalf to detail what they had eaten in the preceding 24 hours. The information was gathered as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Between 1999 and 2018, the proportion of healthier unprocessed or minimally processed foods decreased from 28.8% to 23.5% of consumed calories, the study found. The remaining percentage of calories came from moderately processed foods such as cheese and canned fruits and vegetables, and flavor enhancers such as sugar, honey, maple syrup and butter, the study said. The biggest increase in calories came from ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat meals such as takeout and frozen pizza and burgers: from 2.2% to 11.2% of calories, according to the study. The second largest increase came from packaged sweet snacks and desserts, the consumption of which grew from 10.6% to 12.9%. The link between child health and ultraprocessed food is complex but one recent study in the United Kingdom found that children who eat more ultraprocessed food are more likely to be overweight or obese as adults. Experts said the study’s implications for future health were significant given that childhood is a critical period for biological development and forming dietary habits. “The current food system is structured to promote overconsumption of ultra-processed foods through a variety of strategies, including price and promotions, aggressive marketing, including to youths and specifically Black and Latino youths, and high availability of these products in schools,” wrote Katie Meyer and Lindsey Smith Taillie, both assistant professors in the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina’ Gillings School of Global Public Health, in a commentary on the study. They were not involved in the research. There was good news that suggested efforts to tackle consumption of sugary drinks such as soda taxes had been effective: Calories from sugar-sweetened beverages dropped from 10.8% to 5.3% of overall calories. “We need to mobilize the same energy and level of commitment when it comes to other unhealthy ultra-processed foods such as cakes, cookies, doughnuts and brownies,” said Zhang. Black, non-Hispanic youths experienced a bigger increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in their diet compared to their White counterparts. The study said it did not assess trends in other racial or ethnic groups because of a lack of nationally representative data. However, it noted that Mexican American youths consume ultraprocessed foods at a consistently lower rate, which authors said could reflect more home cooking among Hispanic families. The education level of parents or family income didn’t have any impact on the consumption of ultraprocessed foods, suggesting that they are commonplace in most children’s diets, the study added. The authors said their study had some limitations: Asking people to recall what they ate isn’t always an accurate measure of dietary intake. Plus, there is a tendency to under report socially undesirable habits such as consumption of unhealthy food. In addition, it can be a challenge to accurately classify ultraprocessed food because it requires a full list of ingredients – information unlikely to be given by children answering a questionnaire. “Better methods for dietary assessment and classification of foods are needed to understand trends and mechanisms of action of ultra-processed food intake,” Mayer and Taillie wrote.",Health
Why you ‘regress’ when you go home for the holidays — and how to avoid it," When Gloria Chavez was planning on going home for the holidays for the first time since moving out as an 18-year-old, she found herself anxious at the thought of sitting in her childhood home’s living room, surrounded by family members she hadn’t seen in a while. Once there, Chavez, who was 20 at the time, felt as if she had traveled back in time — responding defensively to unseemly comments and even getting emotional, as she would when she was a teenager. “I don’t see my family members quite often, so, you know, around the holidays is when I see everyone,” Chavez said. “It feels like all of the hard work and all of the years of going to therapy and things like that is gone. I let 15-year-old me take control of everything when I’m around certain people that kind of retrigger those emotions.” For many people, “hometown anxiety” is a common occurrence for those who need to return home for the holidays. On top of making travel arrangements, packing and finding a house sitter, heading back to your hometown for the holidays also means mentally preparing to see those friends and family members you haven’t seen in a while. It could be the unsettling thought of running into someone you knew from high school, or the idea of your parents lapsing into treating you like a little kid again — or counting on certain family members to make the inappropriate comments on your weight, relationship status or career. When going home for the holidays means putting yourself in your childhood home surrounded by the people you grew up with, falling back on old behaviors is a common experience and even has a name — holiday regression. Often, people affected by the phenomenon don’t realize it in the moment, said clinical psychologist Lisa Firestone, the director of research and education at The Glendon Association, a nonprofit that focuses on mental health advocacy in Santa Barbara, California. The feelings arise from implicit memories — memories that exist in our subconscious — and cause us to act out in the same way we used to when growing up in that space. “We may have shifted in our adult life, because we have new relationships and a new sense of ourselves,” Firestone said, “but going back for the holidays, being with your parents and sleeping in your old room, that’s what’s going to trigger you and bring back all those old feelings. Not on a conscious level, but it can definitely put you in that frame of mind, and it can put your parents in that frame of mind, too.” In therapy settings, family units are often referred to as “systems.” From the moment most people are born, they are put into a system between themselves and their parents or guardians — and if they have a sibling, that is another system between siblings. No matter how old the person gets, they will always be the child in their parent’s system, said Stephen Graves, a licensed mental health counselor and the program manager at Loma Linda University’s Health Behavioral Medicine Center in Redlands, California. Certain dynamics are ingrained in families from birth, Graves said. If you are the oldest sibling and were usually the one to make decisions, that will likely still be the case when you’re with your siblings now. The youngest sibling will still get treated like the youngest sibling by their parents, no matter how old they actually are. Graves is in his late 50s, but when he returns home for the holidays, his older relatives still refer to him by his childhood nickname, “Stevie.” “If you have been in this dance with your parents or your family, where you’ve done the tango since you’re 4 years old, and you’ve done the tango with your family for 40 years, and you say, ‘I’m not going to do that anymore,’ it’s easy to say that, but part of the system wants to be in homeostasis,” Graves said. “It seeks to pull members that aren’t doing the same dance back into that old dance.” The anxiety you feel when planning on going back into a stressful environment is often unavoidable, said Debbie Missud, a licensed mental health counselor and psychotherapist who specializes in relationships, anxiety and depression. But there are ways to cope. Missud recommends planning for the situations that might come up — if a conversation starts to turn toward unwanted subjects, have a response ready that you prepared beforehand. “Remind yourself that you don’t have to stay in situations that negatively impact your mental health, and you don’t need to have conversations that you don’t want to have,” Missud said. Falling back into old patterns often happens without us being aware, but you can remind yourself to take breaks periodically to reflect on your mental state, such as going for a walk, going to the bathroom or relocating to a different room away from the crowd, Firestone said. Sometimes, finding a family member you feel most comfortable around, or a space in the house you feel most content in, can help with the unease, Missud said. Now, when Chavez — who is 25 and runs a TikTok account that provides mental health tips for her followers — goes home for the holidays, she reminds herself not to react to inappropriate comments that she had already predicted might happen. “I remind myself who I am and what I stand for. Those comments and those jokes are not who I am, and I’m just going to pass them because it’s not worth it to always react with anger,” Chavez said. “Also, it’s temporary, and I’ll be right back home as quickly as I got there.”",Health
Study reveals first mammal known to mate without using penetration," Bats have long been the odd ones out among mammals. They are the only creatures in this branch of the animal kingdom capable of powered flight. Now researchers say they have discovered another unique trait, with video revealing that the serotine bat may be the first mammal known to mate without using penetration. Also known by the scientific name Eptesicus serotinus, serotine bats mate by touching their genitals together. The male bat uses its penis more like an arm to move a protective membrane away from the female bat’s vulva, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. Bats have “incredible” reproductive biology that has been difficult to study given the nocturnal and secretive nature of many bat species, said study coauthor Nicolas Fasel, a bat specialist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. “Most of the time you’ll see their backs on the wall, and you don’t see what’s really happening in front,” he said. However, thanks to the efforts of a Dutch bat enthusiast who set up 18 video cameras in a church in the Netherlands that was home to a roosting colony of serotine bats, Fasel and his colleagues were able to analyze 93 mating events in detail. Video of an additional four mating events involving the same species came from collaborators at a bat rescue and rehabilitation center in Ukraine. “You can really see the copulation and see that the penis is not going inside,” Fasel said. The footage showed that half of the recorded mating episodes lasted less than 53 minutes, while on one occasion a pair of bats stayed together in a copulative embrace for more than 12 hours. The behavior is similar to a “cloacal kiss,” a way of mating used by many birds. What Fasel and his colleagues observed on the videos may solve a long-standing puzzle about the reproductive biology of this species of bat, and others in the same family. The male bat’s penis is around seven times longer than its female counterpart’s vagina, and it has a heart-shaped head that is seven times wider than the vaginal opening. These are features that appear to make penetrative sex difficult, if not impossible, Fasel noted. Teri Orr, an assistant professor and specialist in bat reproductive systems at New Mexico State University, said she was initially “astonished” to see that males may be using their genitalia as a “copulatory arm” and “maybe transferring sperm much as birds do.” Orr was not involved with the study. “Bats use their uropatagia (tail membranes) in many unique ways such as fishing nets, to catch pups during birth and so forth and thus they are useful in many ways but perhaps an impediment during mating,” Orr said. “I agree that the male of this species may use his genitalia to navigate the female’s tail but there are some key things to be sorted out,” she added via email. “For one: how is the sperm transferred exactly and for another what is the female doing in this pair?” The behavior of the serotine bat reported in the paper is “bizarre and unique” if true, said Alan Dixson, a biology professor at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and the author of the 2021 book “Mammalian Sexuality: The Act of Mating and the Evolution of Reproduction.” However, in his view, the researchers hadn’t provided sufficient evidence to support their unusual claim, added Dixson, who also was not a part of the study. Study coauthor Susanne Holtze, a senior scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, acknowledged that they had not been able to definitively prove the transfer of sperm from male to female bats and said that will be a focus of future research. “It’s a bit of an open question how their semen really gets into the female reproductive tract. It might be that there’s kind of suction involved. We cannot fully answer this mechanism,” she said. Holtze, who specializes in assisted reproduction in animals, said that the information they uncovered during the study would help with her work to come up with a way to artificially inseminate bats. “There are more than 1,000 species of bats, and many of them are also endangered, she said. “So far, no sufficient strategy for assisted reproduction has been established.” Orr, the bat specialist at New Mexico State University, said the study would inform her lab’s work on bat reproduction and whether the unusual reproductive behavior has any implications for understanding human infertility. “Bats do a lot of extreme things during reproduction from storing sperm to extending the duration of a pregnancy,” she explained. There are few bat biologists, and most tend to focus on the more obvious yet still fascinating aspects of bat biology such as flight and echolocation, “rather than what the bats are doing ‘behind closed doors,’” Orr said.",Health
"Exclusive: ‘Act now’ to keep US competitive in space race, senators say"," The top two lawmakers on the US Senate’s space and science subcommittee are pushing federal regulators to accelerate the approval of commercial space launches, arguing that the current pace could cost the United States its edge in the new space race. In a letter sent last week to the head of the Federal Aviation Administration’s commercial spaceflight office, Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Eric Schmitt implored FAA associate administrator Kelvin Coleman to “act now” to eliminate red tape and reduce delays in processing launch and return to Earth — or reentry — licenses. “As the pace of launches from U.S. commercial spaceflight companies increases and China’s state-backed space industry continues to grow, it is imperative that the processes at the FAA and other federal agencies adapt to keep pace with American innovation as well as adversarial threats in space,” the senators wrote in a letter dated November 14. The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is responsible for protecting public safety while simultaneously greenlighting a growing number of commercial space launches, which have quadrupled in just four years. The FAA has already licensed 104 launches this year, compared to 26 launches in 2019. “Keeping pace with industry demand is a priority and is important for several reasons, including meeting our national security and civil exploration needs,” an FAA spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Tuesday.  “We’re working diligently to attract, hire and retain additional staff.” In their letter, the senators named NASA’s commercial partners involved in the agency’s flagship human spaceflight program and urged Coleman to fast-track “high priority missions such as returning Americans to the moon.” Elon Musk’s SpaceX is responsible for developing the lunar lander — called Starship — that will ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo program. During a hearing last month before the Senate space and science subcommittee, a top SpaceX executive accused government regulators of stifling the company’s progress on Starship, a pivotal part of NASA’s Artemis program and the most powerful rocket ever built. “It’s a shame when our hardware is ready to fly, and we’re not able to go fly because of regulations or review,” said William Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president for build and reliability, noting that the company had been ready for more than a month to launch the next Starship test flight. “Licensing, including environmental (review), often takes longer than rocket development. This should never happen. And it’s only getting worse.” The remarks came as SpaceX was the subject of a lengthy environmental review by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a safety review by the FAA after the company’s first test flight of its massive moon rocket exploded about four minutes after lifting off in April. Regulators gave SpaceX the green light to proceed last week, and the company completed a partially successful second test flight on Saturday. In the letter dated the day before the FAA granted the launch license for Starship’s second test flight, Chairwoman Sinema, an independent from Arizona, and Senator Schmitt of Missouri, the top Republican on the subcommittee, told Coleman they were “troubled” by witnesses saying regulatory delays could enable China to continue to close the once-wide gap between itself and the US in space. Beijing is leading a parallel effort to NASA’s Artemis program by attempting to land Chinese astronauts on the same region of the moon and at roughly the same time. “It is no secret that the United States is in a space race with China — our chief economic and military adversary. We cannot be our own worst enemy when it comes to beating China to the moon and Mars,” Schmitt told CNN. The senators are now asking Coleman to respond to several questions, including what additional resources he may need to accelerate the launch licensing process, by November 28.",Health
"The most powerful rocket ever built just went farther than it had ever gone, then was lost"," SpaceX’s gargantuan deep-space rocket system, Starship, safely lifted off Saturday morning but ended prematurely with an explosion and a loss of signal. The Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft successfully separated after liftoff, as the Starship lit up its engines and pushed away. That process ended up destroying the Super Heavy booster, which erupted into a ball of flames over the Gulf of Mexico. But the Starship spacecraft was able to briefly continue its journey. The Starship system made it much farther into flight than the first attempt in April. The rocket and spacecraft lifted off the launchpad at 8 a.m. ET, with the Super Heavy booster igniting all 33 of its Raptor engines. Even during ground tests, SpaceX has had a hard time getting all of those engines, clustered together at the base of the rocket, to power on consistently at the same time. The Starship upper stage had begun its trip Saturday morning strapped to the top of the Super Heavy first stage, a 232-foot-tall (70.7-meter-tall) rocket. About two and a half minutes after roaring to life and vaulting off the launchpad, the Super Heavy booster expended most of its fuel, and the Starship spacecraft fired its own engines and broke away. The Starship spacecraft used its own six engines to continue propelling itself to faster speeds. SpaceX aimed to send the spacecraft to near orbital velocities, typically around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship climbed to an altitude of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface, reaching the edge of space. The US government considers 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth’s surface the edge of outer space. Internationally, the Kármán line, located 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level, is often used to mark the boundary between our planet and space — but there’s a lot of gray area. The SpaceX team awaited acquisition of signal from the spacecraft, but shared during the livestream that the “second stage was lost.” “The automated flight termination system on second stage appears to have triggered very late in the burn as we were headed down range out over the Gulf of Mexico,” aerospace engineer John Insprucker said. The flight termination system is essentially a self-destruct feature that SpaceX engaged to prevent the Starship from traveling off course. “The booster experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly shortly after stage separation while Starship’s engines fired for several minutes on its way to space,” SpaceX shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.” The Federal Aviation Administration, which licensed the Starship’s test flight today, issued a statement after the test flight. “A mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-2 launch from Boca Chica, Texas, on Saturday, Nov. 18. The anomaly resulted in a loss of the vehicle. No injuries or public property damage have been reported,” according to an FAA spokesperson. The agency will conduct a mishap investigation to determine the root cause of the loss of Starship, which is standard procedure. “A return to flight of the Starship Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,” according to the FAA. It took more than four months for the FAA to complete the last mishap investigation after Starship’s test flight in April. NASA is investing up to $4 billion in the rocket system with the goal of using the Starship capsule to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for its Artemis III mission, currently slated to take off as soon as 2025. The endeavor is aiming to return humans to the moon for the first time in five decades, and the successful completion of this test flight would have brought the US space agency and SpaceX one step closer to that goal. “Congrats to the teams who made progress on today’s flight test,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared on X. “Spaceflight is a bold adventure demanding a can-do spirit and daring innovation. Today’s test is an opportunity to learn — then fly again. Together @NASA and @SpaceX will return humanity to the Moon, Mars & beyond.” “Each test represents a step closer to putting the first woman on the Moon with the #Artemis III Starship human landing system. Looking forward to seeing what can be learned from this test that moves us closer to the next milestone,” Jim Free, NASA associate administrator for exploration systems development, shared on X. The failure could spell significant delays for Starship’s development and the key missions lined up on its manifest, most notably NASA’s Artemis III mission. The US space agency tapped Starship in 2021 to serve as the lunar lander for that mission. The root cause of the Starship rocket’s failure on Saturday was not immediately clear. But the booster explosion occurred after a phase called “hot staging” that SpaceX tried for the first time Saturday. The method was used to separate the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket after liftoff. Almost all rockets go through a process during launch called “stage separation,” in which the bottommost rocket booster diverges from the rest of the rocket or spacecraft. When SpaceX launches its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, for example, the first-stage booster — or the bottommost portion of the rocket — breaks away from the upper part of the rocket less than three minutes into flight. The Falcon 9 does so using pneumatic pushers that are housed within the rocket’s interstage, or black band around the center. Instead, the Starship spacecraft fired up its own engines to push itself away from the Super Heavy booster — and it’s essentially separation by blunt force trauma. It marked a crucial moment for SpaceX, as hot staging was expected to be “the riskiest part of the flight,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in October. SpaceX had already said it would consider the mission a success if Starship made it past hot staging. But after hot staging, the Super Heavy booster began tumbling out of control and exploded over the Gulf of Mexico just moments later. SpaceX had hoped to reignite the Super Heavy’s engines and guide it to a controlled landing. “We did know that hot staging was going to be incredibly dynamic,” said Kate Tice, senior manager of SpaceX Quality Systems Engineering, during the livestream. We knew that there was a chance that the booster would not survive, but we’re going to take that data and figure out how we can make the booster better for the next hot stage.” Initially, the Starship spacecraft continued moving along after separation. About eight minutes after liftoff, cheers could be heard echoing throughout mission control as the Starship was approaching the end of its engine burn — putting it on a path toward Earth’s orbit. But nine minutes after launch, SpaceX made it clear that it lost video signal with Starship. And about 11.5 minutes into the flight, the company confirmed it had lost data, indicating Starship wasn’t flying as planned. Then, the spacecraft’s flight termination system was triggered to prevent it from veering off course, bringing an early end to the test flight. If all had gone according to plan, Starship would have continued accelerating toward space. The Starship spacecraft was then slated to complete nearly one full lap of Earth, aiming to splash down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The destruction of the vehicle shortly after liftoff was reminiscent of the Starship’s first launch attempt in April. During that test flight, several of the Super Heavy’s engines unexpectedly powered off and the rocket began spiraling out of control just minutes after liftoff. SpaceX was forced to trigger the system’s self-destruct feature, blowing up both stages over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX took several months to recover from the April mishap. The company was forced to rebuild its launch site, which had been torn to pieces by the sheer force of the rocket powering its engines. The company also implemented upgrades to both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX typically embraces fiery mishaps in the early stages of rocket development. The company has long maintained that it can learn how to build a better rocket more quickly and cheaply by flying — and occasionally exploding — early prototypes rather than relying solely on ground testing and computer modeling. After April’s explosive first test flight, SpaceX noted “success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount.”",Health
Keep an eye on the sky for the Leonid meteor shower this weekend," Up next for end-of-year celestial spectaculars is the Leonid meteor shower, set to produce bright meteors with persistent trains streaking across the night sky. The Leonids have been active since early November but are expected to peak this weekend at 12:33 a.m. ET Saturday, according to EarthSky. Sky-gazers could see 10 to 15 meteors per hour in a dazzling display. Those looking to catch a glimpse of a meteor from this shower are in luck because the moon will be in its waxing crescent phase, and there will not be as much light interference as there is with a full moon, said Dr. Sharon Morsink, a professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. The moon will be 23% full on the night of the shower’s peak, according to the American Meteor Society. While the peak is on Saturday, the same rates of meteors can be seen a few days before and afterward. The best time to view the shower will be after midnight in any time zone when the constellation Leo will be the highest in the sky, said Morsink, who also manages the university’s astronomical observatory. Leo is the meteor shower’s radiant, which is the point where the phenomenon appears to originate from, she explained. “The most important thing is to get away from light pollution,” Morsink said. “You can still see some meteors if you’re in the city, but you’re not going to see anywhere near the number that you get to see if you get out of the city.” The Leonids are famed for generating meteor storms, the term used when a shower reaches rates of at least 1,000 meteors per hour, according to NASA. Holding the record for the highest rate of meteors per hour seen in a meteor stream, the Leonids produced 144,000 meteors per hour in 1966, according to the American Meteor Society. The shower also produced outbursts of higher rates in 1999 and 2001, but the society does not expect another storm until 2099, when the Earth is predicted to encounter a dense cloud of debris from the parent comet, Tempel-Tuttle. As the comet travels around the sun, it leaves a trail of rocks and dust that appears as the annual Leonid meteor shower when Earth moves through the debris while on its own orbital path. Although a Leonid storm event is not predicted for this year, there is always a chance to see a few more meteors than the predicted rate, Morsink said. “Getting out and seeing any meteor shower for the first time is always fun,” she said. “It’s just this interesting connection that we have with the whole solar system — here’s this comet that is far away from us that has been circling the sun for an incredibly long period, billions of years probably. … It’s a way for us to connect with things that are really far away.” Meteors from the Leonids are expected to be seen blazing in the sky until the shower’s finality on December 2, according to the American Meteor Society. If you are eager to see more, here are the remaining meteor showers that peak in 2023: ● Geminids: December 13-14 ● Ursids: December 21-22 There are two full moons remaining in 2023, according to the Farmers’ Almanac: ● November 27: Beaver moon ● December 26: Cold moon",Health
It’s time to walk the dog (and yourself) for better fitness," Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. If you’re struggling to start or maintain a regular exercise regimen, the answer may be sitting faithfully at your feet. Walking your dog is a fantastic way to get in shape, and it benefits both you and your pooch. Some 69 million US households are home to at least one dog. Yet many dog owners never take their pets on a walk, or do so infrequently. Additionally, while 61% of dog owners walked their pup at least 10 minutes at a time, according to a 2011 survey in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health, only 27% walked their dog 150 minutes per week — the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for adults’ weekly, moderate-intensity physical activity. If you’re among those who are not that physically active, use your pooch as inspiration to head outside and start moving. “If you can keep your dog happy and healthy at the same time that you’re keeping yourself healthy and bettering the dog-man bond, that’s great,” said Dr. Jerry Klein, chief veterinary officer with the American Kennel Club. Canine obesity is the No. 1 preventive health problem in American dogs, Klein added. Various studies indicate those who walk their dogs are more than 2.5 times as likely to achieve moderate-intensity physical activity, according to a 2015 journal article. That’s one reason the American Kennel Club created the AKC Fit Dog program. Any dog owner who walks their pet at least 30 minutes five times per week for at least three months receives a free magnet. You’re also eligible if you walk your dog at least 15 minutes 10 times per week for a minimum of three months. As with humans, regular walks are crucial for a dog’s mental and physical health. “Getting your dog out in nature, getting fresh air and sunlight, is just as beneficial for dogs as for people,” said Dr. Victoria Tomasino, owner and medical director at GoodVets Boynton Beach and GoodVets Delray in Palm Beach County, Florida. “It awakens the senses in both parties.” This combination of mental and physical stimulation can also help quash problematic canine behaviors. “Most dogs are bored to death,” said Dawn Celapino, founder of Leash Your Fitness, a San Diego-based business where clients and their dogs work out together. “They need mental stimulation and bonding with their owner, but a lot of people don’t realize that.” Before grabbing a leash, keep some things in mind, Klein said. Your dog should know basic commands such as sit, stay and come. Make sure to slowly increase your walking time and mileage, as dogs need to acclimate to new levels of exercise just as humans do. Flat-faced breeds such as pugs have breathing issues and can’t do a lot of high-intensity or lengthy workouts, while a vet should sign off on any new activity for older dogs. All breeds can struggle with excessive heat or cold, too, so always check the weather. “You also have to be able to read your dog,” Klein said. “If your dog isn’t cooperating or doesn’t seem interested in a walk, try to find something different.” Tomasino agreed that not all dogs enjoy walks. “You see quite often that dogs who are supposed to be high-energy prefer to be couch potatoes,” she said. “It comes down to personality, and you have to respect that.” Thankfully, there are plenty of other ways to be active with your pooch. You can hike, swim, bike, in-line skate , play Frisbee or do circuit training with your dog. There are herding and retrieving events, both organized and competitive, that mimic the activities certain dogs were bred to do. You can harness yourself to a larger-breed dog and cross-country ski together, a sport known as skijoring, or try canicross. Also known as urban mushing, it involves attaching yourself to your dog via a waist harness and bungee leash, then going for a run.

No matter the exercise, be mindful of your pet’s health and safety. Biking, for example, is much easier for the human who is peddling than the dog that’s running. “I see people riding bikes with a dog, and the dog is gasping for breath and limping,” Tomasino said. “But the person is so focused on biking, they’re not paying attention to their dog.” She also nixed using retractable leashes during higher-speed activities such as in-line skating. “With retractable leashes, you have no control over that dog,” Tomasino said. “If another dog is coming at you, for example, that’s dangerous for you and the dog. You need them close to you so you can correct and change course if need be.” Remember to be patient when your dog is learning a new activity, too. “Start slow,” Celapino said. “They might not understand what you want them to do, and they need to work up to things. But don’t discount your dog. Dogs can do a lot of things.” Celapino cited her canine-human fitness classes as an example. During a recent session at a local park, dogs had to sit while their human was performing an exercise, then both ran a lap around the park. “We’re constantly moving, then stopping in my classes, which makes your dog have to think about everything they do,” she said. “That’s what tires them out.” No matter the activity you land on, always tune into your pet. “Exercising is really good bonding for you and your dog, as long as you stay off your phone,” Celapino said. Klein agreed. “What dogs enjoy most is spending time with their people,” he said.",Health
5 things to do when you’re depressed," Editor’s note: Season 8 of the podcast Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta gets back to basics with an in-depth examination of the brain in different states. Each episode will focus on one of those states — the distracted brain, the frightened brain, the nourished brain, etc. — to spotlight what is going on in our heads and how it affects our bodies. (CNN) — Depression is going up in the United States. Chances are if you don’t struggle with the condition, you almost certainly know someone who does. Nearly 18% of US adults — more than 1 in 6 — said they are currently depressed or getting treatment for depression, according to a 2023 Gallup Poll. In 2015, when Gallup first started collecting information on the topic, the number was under 11%. Gallup’s data shows that clinical depression was slowly rising in the country before the pandemic, but it grew faster in its aftermath, with social isolation, loneliness, fear of infection, psychological exhaustion, substance abuse and disruption in mental health care all taking a toll. Rates among women, young adults, and Black and Hispanic adults are rising the fastest. For adolescents, ages 12 to 17, the statistics are also dire: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 million kids in that age group — just over 20% — experienced an episode of major depression in 2021 (the most recent year with available data), with 3.7 million experiencing severe impairment. Psychiatrist Charles Raison, a professor of human ecology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he has struggled with depression himself. Raison, who is also the director of the Vail Health Behavioral Health Innovation Center and a former mental health expert for CNN Health, described the state of mental health in the Unites States in one word: “bad.” “There is just no doubt that depression and anxiety and suicide and substance abuse have been on the rise in the United States … for probably 20, 25 years, maybe longer,” Raison told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on the podcast Chasing Life. “But they’ve really been on the rise over the last 10 years, and the data are really consistent. “The rise is not equal amongst all age groups,” Raison said. “The people that are really suffering are young people. So, people between the ages of like 15 and 35, that’s where you see this really, really disturbing increase.” While the rise of depression among Americans is alarming, what’s also unsettling is the difficulty in pinpointing the cause. We can’t see it on a brain scan. We don’t have a blood test for it. We can’t measure its severity accurately. Raison compared depression to “dropsy” — an old-fashioned term for edema — which could be caused by different underlying conditions or factors. “It could be … heart failure. It could be pneumonia. It could be cancer. There (are) different reasons to produce those symptoms,” he said. “Will we ever find a test for diagnosing depression? No, because depression is like dropsy …,” he said, pointing to possible different underlying causes. “Depression is not a single thing that’s going to yield itself to a single test.” And that may be one reason why depression is so challenging to treat. Take antidepressants such as Prozac, also known by the generic name fluoxetine. It was launched in the country 35 years ago as the first in a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. The idea was depression resulted from a chemical imbalance in the brain, and the imbalance could be corrected by targeting the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, which target two neurotransmitters, followed in 1993. But antidepressants don’t work for everyone. “The question of the use of antidepressants, which are the first-line treatment for depression in the United States, is incredibly complex,” Raison said, noting that they are “lifesavers for some folks.” “But as we’ve gone along in the last 20 years, we’ve had to metabolize, as a field, a number of very hard truths about antidepressants and their effectiveness,” he said. “One hard truth, and the most obvious one, is that they don’t work nearly as well as we thought they did 30 years ago,” estimating that only 30% of patients “get a full response.” To hear what promising new treatments are being tried for depression, listen to the full episode of Chasing Life here: Raison acknowledged that trying to do anything when you are depressed is an uphill battle. He offered these five tips for self-care. Make an appointment with a mental health professional. “If you’re feeling unremittingly down, if you’ve lost interest in life, if your sleep and your appetite are altered, if you feel hopeless, if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself, these sorts of things — that’s what depression is,” Raison said. Getting help is especially important if you’ve experienced those symptoms for a couple of months. “All of us who struggle with depression know that having a clinician … can help you — either with psychotherapy or medications … or both,” he said. It turns out that what is good for the body is also good for the brain. “Really try to do the sort of things that you would do for your physical health,” Raison said. “I often tell people, ‘Think about what you’d do if you wanted to deal with your heart health and do the same thing.’ All those things are also antidepressants. So managing body weight, eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, getting enough exercise, getting sunlight.” Try to maintain close relationships. “(Tip) No. 3 is sometimes very hard when you’re depressed. … But it is probably the single most important thing, which is trying to maximize our interpersonal connections with other people,” Raison said. “If you have caring, smaller, supportive relationships with other people, it’s a big protective factor against getting depressed. It’s also a factor that can really help you get over depression.” Be persistent in seeking help. “The way people, especially in United States, respond to antidepressant medications tends to be very bifurcated,” Raison said. “There’s a smaller group of people that just start an antidepressant, and they feel better within a couple of weeks and … and the depression goes away,” while others struggle with chronic depression. So, if one antidepressant doesn’t work, he said, “Try another.” But don’t be afraid to move on. “We’ve known for a long time, for instance, that people who don’t respond to a bunch of antidepressants in a row are less likely to respond to the next one, but they’re not less likely to respond to psychotherapy,” he said. Generate a state of thankfulness. “Work on developing an attitude of gratitude,” Raison said. Raison admits doing so is not always easy when you’re depressed. “If you can make it a habit, it can be very powerful both to prevent depression, but also to feel better if you are depressed,” he said. We hope these five tips help you better care for a depressed brain. Listen to the full episode here.

"Developing multiple health conditions, including cancer, linked to ultraprocessed foods"," Eating higher amounts of ultraprocessed food raises the risk of being diagnosed with multimorbidity, or having multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, a new study found. “What is particularly significant in this large study is that eating more ultra-processed foods, in particular animal products and sweetened beverages, was linked to an increased risk of developing cancer along with another disease such as a stroke or diabetes,” said Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at World Cancer Research Fund International, which funded the study, in a statement. However, the increased risk was modest, said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, who was not involved in the study. “This paper reports a 9% increase in risk of multimorbidity to be associated with higher intake of ultraprocessed food,” Sanders said in a statement. “Food intake was measured by a questionnaire on one occasion a long time ago. This is important as dietary patterns have changed quite markedly in the past twenty five years with more food eaten outside the home and more ready prepared food being purchased,” Sanders said. While the study cannot conclusively prove that ultraprocessed foods are the direct cause of the multiple diseases, a good deal of other research has shown a connection between certain ultraprocessed foods (UPF) and health harms, said nutrition researcher Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in Norwich, United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study. “Taken with all the other scientific evidence it is very likely that some types of UPF do increase the risk of later disease, either because they are directly harmful or because they replace healthier foods such as vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, olive oils, etc,” Johnson said in a statement. The study’s findings are concerning because in Europe ultra-processed foods make up “more than half of our daily food intake,” said coauthor Heinz Freisling, a nutrition and metabolism scientist at the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in a statement. In the United States, a 2019 study estimated some 71% of the food supply may be ultraprocessed. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients “never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,” according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. The study, published Monday in the journal The Lancet, collected dietary information from 266,666 men and women from seven European countries between 1992 and 2000. Researchers followed the participants for 11 years to see who developed various chronic conditions, including cancer. As they entered the study, each person was asked to recall what they typically ate over the last 12 months, and researchers categorized the foods by the NOVA classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. “To estimate it researchers had to break down foods into different ingredients to try and work out if it is ultra-processed or not,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Mellor was not involved in the study. “This approach, especially as the food data is up to 30 years old, could make this type of interpretation of historical data using a modern definition open to error,” Mellor said in a statement. When ultraprocessed foods were examined by subgroups, not all appeared to be associated with developing multiple chronic conditions, said lead author Reynalda Córdova, a postdoctoral student in pharmaceutical, nutritional and sport sciences at the University of Vienna. “While certain groups, such as animal products and artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages, were associated with increased risk, other groups, such as ultra-processed breads and cereals or alternative plant-based products, showed no association with risk,” Córdova said in a statement. “Our study emphasizes that it is not necessary to completely avoid ultra-processed foods; rather, their consumption should be limited, and preference be given to fresh or minimally processed foods,” co-author Freisling said in a statement.",Health
Being a nice person is not the same as being kind. Why the difference is so important," When my father died of bone cancer last year, I received an outpouring of messages from friends and family sharing their condolences. While I appreciated everyone who reached out, I was especially grateful for two of my former college roommates who surprised my family with a delivery of bagels for breakfast. Although there was a mix-up with the address and we never saw those bagels, this act of kindness stuck with me. It was the intention that mattered more than the actual food. There’s a difference between nice and being kind—even our bodies recognize the distinction. Kindness not only pours a lot of good into the world, but it’s also good for one’s own health. It doesn’t take much to harness the power of kindness, and it can be as simple as wishing someone a good day over text. When was the last time you were nice? You might recall saluting a veteran for their service or greeting a stranger. Being nice involves being polite and pleasing to others. This might feel less authentic and rewarding than performing kind acts, said Dr. Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of the upcoming book, “The Joy of Imperfect Love.” “If you’re people pleasing, you’re placing an expectation on the person you’re being nice to that they respond to you in a certain way,” Manly said. Niceness can be used as a social strategy to get into someone’s good graces, she said. Think about the last time you complimented someone’s outfit but didn’t actually mean it. Did you do it to make them like you or did you feel obligated to comment on their new look since everyone else did? Being kind is less self-serving, said Dr. Ash Nadkarni, an associate psychiatrist and director of wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. On the one hand, kindness involves being generous without expecting to get nothing in return. The other half is the purpose behind the action. A kind person is acting out of compassion and genuine concern for another. The difference is intentionality, said Dr.Catherine Franssen, an associate professor of psychology at Longwood University in Virginia, noting that a kind person tries to really understand what someone else is going through. Practicing kindness rather than niceness allows people to foster deeper genuine connections with others, said Franssen. The more you do it, the easier it will get to relate to others and build more meaningful relationships in all aspects of life. When people act kindly, the brain releases a hormone called oxytocin. Popularly known as the “love hormone,” oxytocin is used to promote social connection with others. Nadkarni said that the influx of oxytocin in the brain dampens activity in the amygdala, a region involved in fear and anxiety. “It suppresses the fear sensation and has a powerful impact on the socioemotional functions of the brain.” If you have ever felt less stressed from helping others, it’s all thanks to the calming effects of oxytocin. It reduces cortisol, the stress hormone that triggers inflammation and a fight-or-flight response when the body senses a potential threat, be it a wild animal or an email from your boss. Along with less cortisol, Nadkarni said oxytocin helps with keeping your heart strong and healthy. The hormone releases nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels and, in turn, reduces blood pressure. “Oxytocin has wide-ranging functions and is really impactful to our health,” said Nadkarni. “Not only does it enhance social connection and improve cardiovascular health, but it also ensures inflammation goes down. (Chronic) inflammation is the basis for a lot of different diseases such as diabetes and depression.” The warm feeling you get from performing an act of kindness is your brain releasing a ton of feel-good chemicals. Franssen said being kind boosts production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood, including happiness. Kindness also releases dopamine, a brain chemical in charge of reward and pleasure. It’s the reason why doing one act of kindness feels so good that you want to do another. Franssen said kindness can secrete endorphins, chemicals in the body that activate the opiate system — the same hormones that make up a runner’s high. Endorphins promote pleasure and act as a natural pain reliever for both physical and emotional pain. “When we do kind things for others and somebody does something unkind to us, it does not feel as bad,” she added. Random acts of kindness you can do today Being kind gives the same health benefits, regardless of how big or small the gesture. Below are some good deeds you can do, starting right now. ●      Pick up litter ●      Check in on a friend who is going through a rough patch ●      Donate blood ●      Text someone good morning ●      Hold the door open for someone ●      Surprise your parents with a visit ●      Send a positive message ●      Leave a generous tip for a server ●      Be an active listener ●      Cook a meal for someone in need Acts of kindness might feel strange and out-of-character at first. However, Manly said this feeling goes away the more you keep practicing. Soon enough, it becomes so familiar you’ll notice the benefits on yourself and others.",Health
Seasonal affective disorder doesn’t mean you have to be SAD. Here are 6 ways to fight the blues," Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Some people might have looked forward to the extra hour of sleep after Daylight Saving Time ended recently, but for millions of people, the shorter days and longer nights are another reminder about the coming of winter (blues). Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that occurs in late fall and winter that has to do with the lack of sunlight. Having shorter days and longer nights during fall and winter can disrupt a 24-hour clock inside our bodies called the circadian rhythm. This clock regulates multiple bodily processes and is influenced by the day-night cycle, said circadian rhythm expert Joseph Takahashi, professor and chair of the neuroscience department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, via email. Disrupted circadian responses may affect brain regions involved in mood, along with causing fatigue and low energy from lack of sleep. Taking care of your health is key to dealing with seasonal affective disorder. Here’s what experts say you can do to manage seasonal affective disorder. Remember to talk to your medical provider before starting any new treatments. Light therapy is the go-to treatment for seasonal affective disorder. It involves exposing yourself to a light box with at least 10,000 lux for at least 30 minutes. (Lux is a unit of measurement for light level intensity.) “A bright sunny day is 50,000 to 100,000 lux,” said Dr. Jason Tucciarone, an instructor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. While you can purchase a light box of lower intensity, you will have to spend more time sitting in front of it. There are two ways a light box helps with seasonal affective disorder. First, mimicking outdoor light corrects the internal clock thrown out of sync from shorter days in winter. Another way is by increasing levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in balancing mood. You can use the light box at any time, but morning use can give you more energy for the rest of the day. “Look away from it and do something where you’re sitting in front of the light, whether it’s eating breakfast, reading the news or anything that will keep you busy for 30 minutes,” Tucciarone said. Make sure to stay 2 to 3 feet away from it and do not look directly into the box because 10,000 lux can hurt your eyes. These type of alarm clocks imitate natural sunlight. When it’s time to wake up, the light gradually increases in intensity. Some research suggests dawn simulators may be just as effective in reducing depressive symptoms. They may be a good addition to your light box therapy, Tucciarone said, as you can get exposed to light the moment you wake up without straining your eyes. Thomas Kilkenny, a sleep specialist at Northwell Health in New York, emphasized the importance of getting enough sleep. The lack of sunlight from shorter winter days can disrupt our internal clocks that tell us when it’s time to be awake and when it’s time to wind down. The disrupted sleep schedule can cause insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Get ready for bed an hour before you plan to go, Kilkenny recommended. Dim the lights, use the bathroom and avoid arguments or emotional situations where you’re going to get yourself worked up. Additionally, avoid using electronics as you start to wind down as they can make it harder to fall asleep. “Phones and computers have bright light which can trick your mind into thinking it’s daylight,” Tucciarone said. Finally, he advised having a stable sleep schedule, which entails going to bed around the same time every night and waking up the same time every morning. Exercise works as a mood booster as it releases chemicals such as serotonin and endorphins to make you feel good and cope better with stress. Even a low-impact activity such as a 10-to-15 minute brisk walk can improve depressive symptoms. Going outside for a small walk can be even more beneficial, Kilkenny said, since you are simultaneously exposing yourself to bright light. If you are going to exercise, Kilkenny recommended doing it in the morning rather than at night. “Working out a couple of hours before bed will actually raise your body temperature, which is a bad idea,” he said. Feeling an urge to hibernate for the winter? Social isolation is common among people with seasonal affective disorder, and isolating may contribute to depressive symptoms. Recently, the US surgeon general reported that being socially disconnected was as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. “Socialization is really important in treating disorders in general,” Tucciarone said. “Isolating is not good for mood.” You may not feel up to a party or a dinner date, but even small amounts of companionship can make a difference. One suggestion from Tucciarone is having a buddy with you when taking outdoor walks. Cognitive behavioral therapy has people with seasonal affective disorder work to develop an awareness on what they’re experiencing, identify negative thoughts and come up with strategies to replace the thoughts with more positive ones, said Lucian Manu, a psychiatrist at Stony Brook Medicine in New York. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be more effective than light therapy at preventing remissions. One study found that six weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy helped reduce depressive symptoms and reduced the chances of developing seasonal affective disorder the following winter. Antidepressants are another option that Manu recommended for people with severe seasonal affective disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for example, work to boost serotonin levels, which can help boost mood. A popular prescription is bupropion, which Manu said helps in managing increasing sleep (along with appetite and weight) for people with seasonal affective disorder.

"Cutting 1 teaspoon of salt works as well as blood pressure meds, study finds"," Cutting 1 teaspoon of salt from your diet each day can lower your top blood pressure reading just as much as a typical hypertension medication, even if you don’t have high blood pressure, a new study found. A teaspoon of salt is 2,300 milligrams — that’s the top daily limit for people over 14 recommended by the latest US nutritional guidelines. However, the American Heart Association recommends a diet with less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day. “This is the first study to show that people who are already on blood pressure medication can lower their blood pressure even more by limiting sodium,” said coprincipal investigator Norrina Allen, professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “And regardless of medication, we found 70% to 75% of people are likely to see a reduction in their blood pressure if they lower the sodium in their diet,” Allen said. High blood pressure is often called the “silent killer,” because there are no symptoms — the only way to know if you have it is to test for it. Yet hypertension affects 1 in 3 adults worldwide and can lead to heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage and stroke, according to a 2023 report by the World Health Organization. Nearly half of all Americans live with high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association. About a third of those have “resistant” hypertension, high blood pressure that has not responded despite the concurrent use of three types of medications. A 2021 study found men ages 20 to 49 are up to 70% more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension than women of the same age. “Most people today eat way too much salt because it’s added into nearly everything we eat,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “A teaspoon of salt may seem like a small amount. However, that added salt seems to have an effect on blood pressure that is surprisingly large,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. The study, published Saturday in the journal JAMA, assigned 213 people ages 50 to 75 to one week of a high- or low-sodium diet. After eating that diet for seven days, each person then switched to the alternate diet. About 25% of the participants had normal blood pressure, while another 25% had untreated hypertension. Of the remaining group, 20% had blood pressure under control, while 31% did not. During the high-salt week, people ate their normal diet, along with two bouillon packets, each containing 1,100 milligrams of sodium. During the low-salt week, people ate foods with low sodium, purchased and given to them by dietitians. The goal was only 500 milligrams of salt a day, a dramatic drop. The drop in blood pressure while on the low-sodium diet was quick and dramatic, according to the study. Compared to the high-sodium diet, blood pressure on the extremely low-salt diet dropped 8 millimeters of mercury. “Compared to their normal diet, people reduced their blood pressure by about 6 millimeters of mercury, about the same effect you’d see for a first-line blood pressure medication,” Allen said. “In addition, that drop happened pretty quickly and was consistent for people with normal blood pressure, slightly high blood pressure or those already on medications.” Cutting this amount of salt didn’t have any significant side effects, Allen said, unless you count adjusting to a blander diet. “When you go from a high-salt diet to a low-salt diet, everything tastes bland,” she said. “I want to encourage people to stick with it because your taste buds do adjust within a couple of weeks or so, and you really do get taste and flavor back and normal things will taste very salty. “Taste bud adjustment takes a little bit longer, but the blood pressure improvements are pretty quick,” she added. Blood pressure medications, however, can have many side effects, including cough, constipation or diarrhea, dizziness, lack of energy, headache, muscle pain, nausea, nervousness, fatigue, weight gain or loss, and erection issues. Typically, these ease over time, according to the National Library of Medicine. Putting down the saltshaker is a good start, “but that’s not where most people get their salt,” Freeman said. “It’s in foods you’d not expect to have a lot of salt: A couple of slices of bread could have 400 or 500 milligrams of salt; a pickle has a full day’s worth of salt; and a bowl of soup could have several days’ worth of salt in it,” he said. But careful shopping can accomplish the task, Allen said. Dietitians purchased the low-sodium diets provided in the study after reading labels at local grocery stores, Allen said. CNN looked at the low-salt menu and found most breakfasts included store-bought quick oats, Greek yogurt and grapes, while lunch featured grilled chicken, lettuces dressed with oil and vinegar, and low-salt versions of lentil soup, breads, peanut butter and tortilla chips. Dinners included ready-to-eat brown rice and veggies, burritos and lasagna. “They were the low-salt versions of vegetable lasagna,” Allen said. “They were apples and bananas and things everyone could get at the grocery store. They were not specially prepared by a chef.” The award-winning DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, is an expert-approved method of lowering salt intake. DASH has a simple premise: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods; limit foods high in saturated fat; and limit your sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams a day, just as this study did. The DASH meal plan includes four to six servings of vegetables and another four to six servings of fruit, three servings of whole-grain products, two to four servings of fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and several servings each of lean meats and nuts, seeds and legumes each day. Regardless of which diet plan chosen, those who want to cut salt are better off making their own foods at home, where they can read labels and calculate sodium levels, Freeman said. Eating at a restaurant, even if it’s healthy, could be troublesome. “Take a vegetable dish at a restaurant: Those green beans may have been prepared with salted butter with salted crispy onions or whatever on top. Before long you’ve had a huge salt load that was never intended,” Freeman said. “The best way to eat is to eat as unprocessed as possible.”",Health
Opinion: Here’s one more reason to stop shaming parents," For years, experts and self-anointed experts like momfluencers have been telling parents like me that following certain practices would get our kids to put themselves to sleep and sleep through the night. Now, a new study suggests the reason some kids don’t sleep well is because they’re genetically predisposed to insomnia — not because their moms can’t get sleep training right. I hope these findings will prompt our society to radically rethink the way parents — but, let’s face it, especially mothers — are instructed, judged and shamed for our parenting practices. The new research, published Wednesday in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, finds that children who have genetic predispositions for insomnia are more likely to have trouble falling asleep and tend to wake up more throughout the night. This makes perfect sense to me because, as a baby, my first child was a terrible sleeper. For the first several years of her life, it took her an incredibly long time to fall asleep, and she woke up regularly all night long. Reading this study, I have to wonder if maybe the reason was genetic. Of course, as a new mom, I was asked by everyone — pediatricians, family members, fellow mamas, strangers I passed on the sidewalk — how my baby was sleeping, and when I said it wasn’t going well, I almost always got the same answer: I needed to try harder to sleep train her. The problem, most people seemed to assume, was that I wasn’t tough enough to let her cry it out for a few nights until she got the hang of things. Sleep training — or letting a baby cry until they learn how to sleep — feels like the predominant advice given to parents these days, though there are also plenty of people who will shame parents for doing so (of course). I tried this method with my first child. It didn’t work. This new study suggests it’s possible that it wasn’t my parenting after all — maybe my kid’s genetics just make it difficult for her to sleep. There’s a bigger lesson here that goes far beyond what parents should be taught about getting kids to sleep. It’s that there isn’t a right way to parent all kids because every one is different. So, when we see a momfluencer share a TikTok with the tips that help her get her kid magically to sleep, what she’s sharing is what works for her child in the context of her family’s circumstances. That’s often quite different from what will work for others. Yet so many moms are left feeling like they can’t cut it if other people’s recipes don’t work for them. As I argue in my forthcoming book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls and How We Can Take It Back,” all this advice targeted at moms on social media can help explain why, as the use of social networks exploded from 2000-2015, the rate of postpartum depression among women who gave birth in hospitals rose by a rate of seven, according to a 2019 study. I don’t want to judge momfluencers too harshly here. Amy Tuteur, an obstetrician I interviewed for my book, pointed out that many moms who share their tips online are doing so because it’s one of the only ways moms can get validation in our society. “There’s a lot of doubt involved in parenting,” she told me. “You never know if you’re doing it the right way, and it’s not like your child is helping you. Your child isn’t saying, ‘Thank you for sending me to time out and helping me learn about delayed gratification.’ No, they’re lying there on the floor screaming at you.” But, when we see these posts, we should take them for what they are: advice that worked for one family. If it’s helpful (and safe), take it — but if it doesn’t work given the (likely very different) characteristics of our own kid and life, it doesn’t mean we’ve failed. It just means we’re different! Our society, too, should stop preaching what works for some people as universal gospel. The study released this week reminds us that when a kid struggles, it’s often not their parent’s fault. So, it would be a good idea for everyone to think twice before pushing their parenting strategies on others — and perhaps, instead, acknowledge how very hard parenting can be. Not having to deal with these kinds of messages of failure would at least give parents one less thing to lose sleep over.",Health
Amazon pulling seven brands of eye drops after FDA warning," The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning to Amazon for selling several brands of eye drops that the agency considers “unapproved new drugs.” On Monday, the FDA released a warning letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy noting that the e-commerce website was selling seven brands of eye drops marketed as treatments for conditions like pink eye, dry eyes, dust irritation and cataracts. As a result, the agency says, the products can be classified as “new drugs” that Amazon is distributing without FDA approval. The brands included in the letter are Similasan Pink Eye Relief, the Goodbye Company Pink Eye, Can-C Eye Drops, Optique 1 Eye Drops, OcluMed Eye Drops, TRP Natural Eyes Floaters Relief and Manzanilla Sophia Chamomile Herbal Eye Drops. Amazon says it has begun removing the products from its online marketplace. “Safety is a top priority at Amazon,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We require all products offered in our store to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The products in question have been investigated and are in the process of being removed.” Amazon’s sale and distribution of the eye drops – which the FDA says are not “generally accepted as safe and effective” – without prior agency approval constitutes a violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and United States Code, according to the letter. “These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective,” the FDA’s letter says. “Ophthalmic drug products, which are intended for administration into the eyes, in general pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body’s natural defenses.” Monday’s warning letter follows others from the FDA raising the alarm about eye drops. In October, the agency warned that dozens of over-the-counter eye drop products, including those sold under store brands including CVS, Target, Walmart and Rite Aid, could lead to eye infections resulting in vision loss or blindness. Although eye drops are supposed to be sterile, the agency reported that the facility where the drops were manufactured had “insanitary conditions” and “positive bacterial test results from environmental sampling of critical drug production areas” in the facility. CVS, Rite Aid and Target removed the products from store shelves and websites. Cardinal Health, which had six of its Leader brand eye drops on the FDA’s list, issued a recall for the products in early November. On Wednesday, Mumbai-based Kilitch Healthcare India Ltd., which manufactured the affected eye drops from the October recall, also issued a recall for all the eye drops on the FDA’s warning list. Kilitch Healthcare India Limited said it had not received any reports of adverse events related to the recall as of November 15. Earlier this year, the FDA warned against using several other eye drop products due to contamination from bacteria or fungus. In February, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged health care providers and patients to avoid using EzriCare eye drops after an investigation into bacterial contamination linked with over 80 infections across 18 states. The infections involved a rare strain of the drug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never before been identified in the US. Four deaths were reported, along with 14 instances of vision loss and four cases in which eyeballs had to be surgically removed.",Health
Why most men don’t have enough close friends," Friendships aren’t just about those you sit with on the school bus or play alongside on your childhood baseball team — they are a core component of the human experience, experts say. But making and retaining deep, meaningful friendships as an adult is hard, especially for men, according to research. Less than half of men report being satisfied with their friendships, and only about 1 in 5 said they had received emotional support from a friend in the last week, compared with 4 in 10 women, according to a 2021 survey from the Survey Center on American Life. The falling off of friendships between men begins around middle and late adolescence and grows starker in adulthood, said Judy Yi-Chung Chu, who teaches a class on boys’ psychological development at Stanford University. And those who do maintain friendships with other men say they tend to have lower levels of emotional intimacy than women report. “Boys don’t start emotionally disconnected; they become emotionally disconnected,” said Dr. Niobe Way, a researcher and a professor of applied psychology at New York University. All humans have the innate capacity and desire for close, emotionally intimate connections with others. We need these relationships for survival as babies and then to thrive as we get older, Chu said. Research has shown close friendships protect our mental and physical health, she added. And men who prioritize those relationships are fighting off one of the most harmful things to human health — loneliness, said Dr. Frank Sileo, a psychologist based in Ridgewood, New Jersey. “What (men) are at risk of losing is this sense of not being alone in the world or not being alone in their experience,” Sileo said. Research has shown “disclosure of emotional distress improved (men’s) emotional well-being, increased feelings of being understood and resulted in less reported loneliness,” he added. Just as many men strive to eat right, exercise, succeed in their careers and raise children, men should prioritize developing friendships as adults, he said. When Sileo first began conducting research on male friendships in 1995, many participants assumed his survey was about homosexuality, he said. Such stereotypes that male bonding would be, or become, sexual in nature are inaccurate but revealed some of what may be holding some men back from deep friendships, he added. Assumptions nearly 30 years later might be different, but social pressures remain that make it difficult for men to express the vulnerability and intimacy needed for close friendships, Sileo said. We are all born with two sides of ourselves: the hard side that is stoic and independent and the soft one that is vulnerable and interdependent, said Way, author of “Deep Secrets: Boys’ Friendships and the Crisis of Connection.” The hard side has been characterized as masculine and inherently preferable, and the soft side has been seen as feminine and lesser than, Way said. Boys receive messages that growing up and “manning up” mean shedding that soft side — a mindset that neuroscience, social science and developmental psychology all show is harmful to them, Way said. “We gender relationships as feminine,” Chu said. “If that’s a feminine thing, it becomes a weakness or a liability if (men) admit to needing friendships.” Characterizing the gender of these experiences has a clear impact, Sileo said. Men who were more emotionally restricted, focused on power and who scored high on surveys measuring homophobia are less likely to have intimate and close friendships, he said. And the drive to toughen up and never show vulnerability that restricts men from friendships can lead them to loneliness, violence and anger, Way said. “We live in a culture that clashes with our nature,” she said. “If we raise children to go against their nature, we shouldn’t be surprised if some of those children grow up to struggle.” Heterosexual men seeking closeness might turn to those they see as better at building relationships and feel comfortable exploring their vulnerability with: the women in their lives and their romantic partners, Way said. It may seem like a good solution, but it works neither for the men nor the women they look to, Sileo said. Putting everything on a romantic partner can strain a relationship, he said, whether it is going to a female partner exclusively for emotional support or depending on her to cultivate friendships and get-togethers for holidays and weekends. It is crucial to have multiple people to go to for support for different perspectives, Chu added. “(Men) need to know it’s not just a woman thing,” she said. “They need to know that men can do it, too.” Community is important, and keeping struggles, questions and concerns with one person or one relationship doesn’t always provide the best help to see them through, Way said. “A male partner thinks it’s betrayal to talk to another person,” Way said, “but the female partner is saying, ‘Please do it, please get other perspectives.’” If you are wishing you had close friendships or that the ones you have went deeper, experts say it’s OK to start small. You don’t even have to disclose your own vulnerabilities at first, Chu said. “A very powerful place to start is listening and asking real questions,” she said. “All people love when they can trust that this situation is safe and that someone is genuinely interested in them.” The key is to move beyond banter and general niceties and ask questions you find meaningful, such as what friends like about their jobs or what happens to their feelings after breakups, Way said. Don’t worry. It’s not rude to do so. Most people report wanting to be asked these questions, she said. Each relationship has its own rules and protocol, and it’s good to work within these, Sileo said. You might start asking something of a friend and find that person is hesitant to talk about it, Chu said. If this is the case, you can jump in and offer your own vulnerability by talking about how that topic might be bothering you or how you’ve been thinking about it. Sometimes the rules of the relationship might mean avoiding the vulnerability of sitting face-to-face, Sileo said. In those cases, find an activity such as the gym, work or a community project where you can connect side by side through a shared purpose, Sileo added. And if you need to build friendships from scratch, follow the lead of the women in your life and ask someone to grab coffee or a bite to eat, Way said. Putting in time, effort and intention is the key, Sileo said. Showing up and spending time is crucial to building those important friendships. “Quality counts here,” he said. “If you can have a handful of friends that are quality, that’s better than having a slew of friends.”",Health
"About three-quarters of Americans do not fear getting Covid-19 this holiday season, KFF survey finds"," Most adults in the United States are not worried about getting sick with Covid-19 or spreading it over the holidays, a new survey from KFF found. Only about half say they plan to get the latest vaccine, and there’s a similar split around plans to take other precautions. Overall, about three-quarters of adults say they are “not too worried” or “not at all worried” about getting Covid-19 over the holidays, and two-thirds say they are not worried about spreading the virus to people close to them, according to the new survey. Concern about rising cases and hospitalizations is slightly higher, with nearly half (46%) of adults saying they are “very” or “somewhat” worried that Covid-19 hospitalizations will increase this winter – about the same as last year. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that there were about 14,700 Covid-19 hospitalizations for the week ending November 4, compared with about 23,600 hospitalizations during a comparable week in 2022. But last year, hospitalizations rose significantly the week after Thanksgiving after a similar lull. Flu activity is also starting to rise across the US, CDC data shows. Covid-19 vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalization, yet just over half of adults say that they do not plan to get the latest Covid-19 vaccine that became available in September, including nearly a third of adults who have previously been vaccinated against the coronavirus. Lack of concern about the virus was a factor for most of those who got an earlier version of the vaccine but haven’t gotten the newest one, the KFF survey found. And about half of adults say they do not plan to take other precautions to reduce their risk, the KFF survey found. Only about a third of adults say they plan to avoid large gatherings this respiratory virus season, more than a quarter plan to wear a mask in crowded places or avoid travel, and about a fifth said they would avoid indoor restaurants or take a Covid-19 test before visiting family and friends. There are stark political divides and differences among racial and ethnic groups in attitudes toward Covid-19, the survey data shows. Democrats are about three times more likely than Republicans to say they’ve gotten the new shot or plan to do so, and they’re more than twice as likely to say they will take precautions against Covid-19 this respiratory virus season. Black and Hispanic adults are much more likely than White adults to say they plan to take at least one precaution and more likely to say they have gotten the new vaccine or plan to do so. The findings in the KFF report are based on responses from a nationally representative sample of about 1,400 adults who were interviewed between October 31 and November 7.",Health
Report on worker’s death finds that marijuana-processing workers may be at high risk of developing asthma," Workers who process marijuana may be at high risk of developing asthma and these cases can be serious, according to a new report that highlights a recent death in the cannabis industry. Findings from the death investigation are published in Thursday’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the medical journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 27-year-old woman who died worked as a cycle counter — a worker who tracks inventory — and worked in areas where cannabis flowers were ground to make joints or pre-rolls that are sold in dispensaries. She began working at the facility, located in Massachusetts, in May of 2021, according to the report. By July of that year, she had begun to wheeze, which was noted in her medical records. She had not previously been diagnosed with asthma. Her mother told federal and state investigators that she had developed a runny nose, cough and shortness of breath after 3 to 4 months on the job. In October, she moved to flower production, where cannabis flowers were ground and high levels of plant dust were generated. She wore an N95 mask and long sleeves and gloves, but other employees reported that her cough increased, particularly when the grinder was on. On November 9, 2021, she struggled to breathe and was taken by ambulance to the emergency room. On the way to the hospital, she was given albuterol through a nebulizer and was able to breathe more normally. She told the paramedics she thought she might be allergic to something at work. She was prescribed steroids and advised to follow up with her primary care physician. On January 4, she complained to a co-worker that her cough was getting worse. Later that day, while she was filling pre-rolls, she began sneezing and her coughing increased. Despite using an inhaler, her shortness of breath worsened, and her co-workers called an ambulance. Her heart stopped before the ambulance got there. Her colleagues performed CPR and she regained circulation, but she never regained consciousness. Doctors declared her brain dead 3 days later and life support was withdrawn. Medical experts with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated her case. They found dust levels at the facility were within permissible limits, though their report notes that a new shop vacuum with a HEPA filter had been purchased by the company since the employee’s death. Levels of endotoxin, an inflammatory substance produced by bacteria that can contaminate cannabis flowers, were also within legal limits, leading the investigators to conclude that even exposures below those limits may be high enough to trigger asthma and other allergic symptoms. Investigators interviewed 10 current and former co-workers of the woman who died, and four of them also reported work-related breathing problems or skin irritation.  One man, who no longer worked here, also had symptoms of occupational asthma, according to the case report. The researchers note that one study of a cannabis production facility in Washington found almost half the 31 workers had symptoms suggestive of asthma.  Of 10 employees with symptoms of cannabis allergy related to their work, seven had abnormal breathing tests, and five reacted to cannabis on skin prick tests, which are used to diagnose allergies. The researchers warn that occupational asthma can take months or years to develop after a person is first exposed to an irritant, and that fatal attacks can occur even when disease is considered mild. They say workers at cannabis processing plants appear to be at high risk for developing the condition, and they say new strategies are needed to protect workers in this rapidly expanding industry.",Health
CRISPR treatment has been greenlit in UK in global first. Here’s who it could help," The United Kingdom has become the first country to give regulatory approval to a medical treatment involving the revolutionary CRISPR gene editing tool. The country’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Thursday it had given a greenlight to a treatment known as Casgevy, which will be used to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Both genetic conditions are caused by errors in the genes for hemoglobin, which is used by red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. There is no known universally successful treatment for either disorder. Sickle cell disease, which can result in attacks of debilitating pain, is more common in people with an African or Caribbean family background. Beta thalassemia mainly affects people of Mediterranean, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin, the statement said. “Both sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia are painful, life-long conditions that in some cases can be fatal. To date, a bone marrow transplant — which must come from a closely matched donor and carries a risk of rejection — has been the only permanent treatment option,” said Julian Beach, the interim executive director of healthcare quality and access at the MHRA, in a statement. “I am pleased to announce that we have authorised an innovative and first-of-its-kind gene-editing treatment called Casgevy, which in trials has been found to restore healthy haemoglobin production in the majority of participants with sickle-cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia, relieving the symptoms of disease.” The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique allows scientists to make very precise changes to DNA. Its inventors — Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna —  won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020. Casgevy isn’t a simple pill or injection. The treatment, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is administered by taking stem cells out of a patient’s bone marrow and editing a gene in the cells in a lab. Patients then must undergo a “conditioning treatment,” which can involve an immunosuppressing drug, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, to prepare the bone marrow before the modified cells are infused back into the patient, according to the MHRA. “After that, patients may need to spend at least a month in a hospital facility while the treated cells take up residence in the bone marrow and start to make red blood cells with the stable form of haemoglobin,” according to the statement. The US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the same treatment and is expected to make a decision on whether to greenlight it by December 8. “This is a great step in the advancement of medical approaches to tackle genetic diseases we never thought would be possible to cure,” said Alena Pance, a senior lecturer in genetics at the University of Hertfordshire, in a statement released by the Science Media Centre, which provides information to journalists. “Modifying the stem cells from the bone marrow of the patient avoids the problems associated with immune compatibility, i.e. searching for donors that match the patient and following immunosuppression, and constituting a real cure of the disease rather than a treatment,” Pance added. The release from the MHRA did not say how much the treatment would cost, but it’s likely to be expensive. CRISPR-Cas9 has had a major impact on biomedical research, clinical medicine and agriculture and is widely used in labs around the world. The cutting-edge technology was tainted with controversy after Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced in 2018 he had created the world’s first gene-edited babies. Scientists say the powerful technique should not be used to manipulate human genes that will be passed down from one generation to the next.",Health
‘Squid Game: The Challenge’ turns the dystopian drama into a super-sized ‘Big Brother’," Just producing a reality-competition show based on “Squid Game” is a pretty good way of signaling to the world that you didn’t really get “Squid Game.” Setting that aside, Netflix’s massive version of the South Korean series, dubbed “Squid Game: The Challenge,” logically morphs the concept into a super-sized “Big Brother,” mirroring the original drama’s look if not (thank goodness) its body count. The numbers certainly paint an impressive picture, with 456 contestants vying for a record prize of $4.56 million, winner take all. If that sounds like a casting nightmare, it clearly is, and the sheer scale of the exercise suggests the program will probably need to run several years just to amortize the cost of assembling it, beginning with that creepy doll presiding over the game of “Red Light, Green Light.” The producers try to humanize the players as best they can, sprinkling up-close-and-personal interviews throughout the festivities, in a way that creates expectations – and occasionally subverts them – about what comes next. It’s certainly an eclectic bunch, from a mother-and-son tandem to a former football player whose coalition-building tactics and swagger quickly make him a target of other participants. Yet even with the distinctive design, down to the matching numbered sweatsuits and faceless “guards” monitoring the action, “Squid Game: The Challenge” perhaps inevitably falls back on traditional language and tropes of the reality-competition genre, a tale as old as “Survivor” and “Big Brother’s” invasion of the US almost a quarter-century ago. Loosely translated, that means psychological gamesmanship and strategizing, tears and near-meltdowns, and plenty of brash talk about being in it to win it and not being there to make friends. Inevitably, there’s also plenty of padding, with the music working overtime to stoke the suspense. The tension, frankly, is somewhat mitigated in the early going by the massive odds against surviving – the equivalent of the NCAA basketball tournament times seven, with the stakes slowly rising as the herd gets thinned and the chance of victory comes into sharper focus. Netflix does break with form in one respect, spreading the 10 episodes (five were previewed) over three weeks – its own version of March Madness to kick off the holidays. The contestants have obviously studied the series seeking clues or hints that might enhance their chances of survival. What the game can’t approximate (mercifully) is the life-or-death aspect of the experience, which the producers try to approximate – and the players oddly mime – by having people dramatically drop to the ground when they’ve been “shot” with paint pellets as a sign of their elimination. The original 2021 dramatic series, which has the green light for a second season, derived part of its allure from its dystopian vision of how the class struggle and reality television might intersect, with the poor desperately striving and dying to the amusement of the rich. The competition series incorporates its share of sob stories, but despite the cut-throat jockeying – and reports of some contestants requiring medical attention during filming in the UK – producers might toy with contestants for our collective amusement without tipping over into “The Hunger Games” or “The Running Man.” Of course, if “Squid Game: The Challenge” hangs around long enough to justify the investment in those massive sets, it’s anybody’s guess where the “red light” will be, or how far players will go for that big ball of cash. For now, a little emotional turmoil and a whole lot of time-filling is, as they say, just part of playing the game. “Squid Game: The Challenge” premieres November 22 on Netflix.",Entertainment
"Matt Rife stirs backlash with domestic abuse joke, responds with link to medical helmets"," Comedian Matt Rife is doubling down on his humor. The comic, who gained popularity on TikTok and has appeared on shows like “Wild N’Out” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” has stirred controversy with a bit about domestic violence in his recent Netflix special, “Matt Rife: Natural Selection.” The set includes a joke about a female server at a restaurant having a black eye. “My boy who I was with was like: ‘Yeah, I feel bad for her, man. I feel like they should put her in the kitchen or something where nobody has to see her face, ya know?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, but I feel like if she could cook, she wouldn’t have that black eye,’” Rife said. The humor didn’t go over well with some, which Rife appeared to anticipate as he followed up the joke by saying, “I figure if we start the show with domestic violence the rest of the show should be smooth sailing.” After a clip of joke circulated on social media and drew criticism, Rife responded on Instagram Stories. “If you’ve ever been offended by a joke I’ve told, here’s a link to my official apology. Tap to solve the issue,” linking to a site which sells helmets to protect against head trauma for individuals with special needs. CNN has reached out to representatives for Rife for comment. Some people on Rife’s Instagram account defended his comedy and urged him to not back down. He also faced criticism in 2016 and 2020 for offensive tweets. On Wednesday, Rife posted an Instagram story letting his followers know he also has two comedy special that can be streamed for free on YouTube.",Entertainment
Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan to kick off another chapter of ‘The Karate Kid’ franchise," Get ready to wax on, wax off, yet again. Perennial favorite film franchise “The Karate Kid” will return next year with a new movie scheduled to go into production soon, Sony Pictures announced on Tuesday. The film will feature Ralph Macchio – who was the titular “Kid” in the first three movies in the franchise – and Jackie Chan, who took over from Oscar nominee Pat Morita in role of the older martial arts master who acts as mentor in the 2010 reboot. Macchio and Chan appeared in a YouTube video on Tuesday morning in support of the new film being announced and to launch a casting search for the next young star of the franchise. Next June will mark the 40th anniversary of the first “Karate Kid,” which starred Macchio as a California high school student who learns how to fight – as well as act with honor and restraint – from his neighbor after a group of bullies target him. Macchio went on to appear in “Karate Kid Part II” in 1986 and “Karate Kid Part III” in 1989. A fourth installment, “The Next Karate Kid,” came five years later and featured Hilary Swank. In 2010, Chan starred in “The Karate Kid” reboot opposite Jaden Smith, but the franchise truly gained fresh traction a number of years later, when “Cobra Kai” premiered in 2018. That Emmy-nominated series, soon airing its final season, catches up with Macchio’s Danny and the character of Johnny – the bully played by William Zabka in the first two movies – all grown up. “Cobra Kai” has gone on to become wildly popular on Netflix, with a fifth season wrapping up last year. A representative for Zabka did not immediately return a request for comment on whether he will be featured in the new feature film alongside Macchio. The new “Karate Kid” installment is set to premiere in theaters on December 13, 2024.",Entertainment
Martha Stewart clarifies her holiday plans: ‘It’s not true that I gave up Thanksgiving!’," Not to worry. Martha Stewart, hostess extraordinaire, is still participating in the holiday most associated with food and entertaining this year. Stewart on Tuesday took to social media to clear up recent reports that she had cancelled Thanksgiving after being “turkeyed out,” as she said on Kelly Clarkson’s daytime talk show. “It’s not true that I gave up Thanksgiving!,” Stewart wrote in a multi-part Instagram post. “What I cancelled was the planned gathering at my house due to guest cancellations and travel plans!” Far from putting her feet up, Stewart wrote that she was “prepping to bake thirty pies” and getting ready to cook a “stuffed and roasted 20-pound organic, heritage bird” to help “supplement” her friend Stephen Sill’s “buffet.” And that’s not all. The lifestyle and food expert also shared that she was “baking lemon tarts, cranberry tarts, chocolate pecan pies, pecan pies and pumpkin pies.” Cooking isn’t the only thing that’s keeping Stewart busy. “In addition, we are staying home for two days to plant 75 new peonies, dig up hundreds of other peonies for relocation, move dozens of hostas and finish planting the Spring flowering bulbs,” she wrote. “Leaves are systematically being blown and composted, compost is being spread atop all the flower beds, and burlap coats are being made to cover the hundreds of boxwood shrubs for the cold winter ahead,” There is one thing that won’t be a part of her holiday this year, however. “My colossal chocolate turkey, crafted using my giant antique turkey mold, did not survive storage since October, crumbling into itself,” she wrote. “I am melting the chocolate and using it for the chocolate pecan pies.” Stewart ended her message asking followers to share photos of their Thanksgiving meals or table settings. She also shared her hopes for more peace in the world.",Entertainment
The Rolling Stones are hitting the road next year on a tour sponsored by AARP," After 60 years, The Rolling Stones are still going strong and gearing up for another concert tour.

"BTS members RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook enlist for South Korean military service"," Four more members of South Korean boy band BTS are set to start their compulsory military service as the group’s hiatus continues. This means all seven members of BTS are now either serving in the South Korean military or in the process of enlisting. “We would like to inform our fans that RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook have initiated the military enlistment process,” the band’s music label BIGHIT Music wrote in a statement. “The artists are preparing to fulfill their military service duties. We will inform you of further updates in due course,” it added. “We ask you for your continued love and support for RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook until they complete their military service and safely return. Our company will spare no effort in providing support for our artists,” the statement continued. Military service is mandatory in South Korea, where almost all able-bodied men are required to serve in the army for 18 months by the time they are 28 years old. South Korea’s parliament passed a bill in 2020 allowing pop stars – namely those who “excel in popular culture and art” – to defer their service until the age of 30. In October 2022, the label announced that members of the band would embark on military service, with Jin, the oldest member, the first to start the process. Jin turned 30 in 2022, and the band also announced a break from group musical activities to pursue solo projects in June that year. Members J-Hope and Suga enlisted earlier this year. BTS is expected to reconvene as a group around 2025, according to BIGHIT Music. The record label said it has been looking at the timing of the band’s military service, “to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men,” and it said the time was “now.” BTS formed in 2013 with seven members: RM, Jin, V, J-Hope, Suga, Jimin and Jungkook. The band went on to achieve global fame, with number one singles in more than 100 countries around the world. In 2022, BTS was the 5th most streamed artist in the world on Spotify, and the most streamed K-pop artist.",Entertainment
Cara Delevingne says Travis Kelce and her friend Taylor Swift’s relationship is ‘very different’," Cara Delevingne sounds thrilled about her friend Taylor Swift’s relationship with Travis Kelce. The model and actress spoke with E! about the twosome. “I’m so, so happy for her,” Delevingne said over the weekend at the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix. “There’s definitely something very different about them.” Delevingne is one of Swift’s close friends. She was recently part of a girls’ night out in New York City with Swift, Selena Gomez, Sophie Turner, Gigi Hadid and Brittany Mahomes, who is married to Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and teammate of Kelce. Delevingne sounds happy for Swift and Kelce. “I’m always rooting for my girl,” she told the outlet. Her comments came as Kelce has also opened up about his relationship with Swift. He is featured in WSJ Magazine’s new issue and said of Swift, “Obviously I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I’ve never dealt with it.” “But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it…. The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life,” Kelce told the publication. “When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.” It’s the first time the professional football player has gone public with the fact that he and Swift are dating, even though it’s been assumed, especially after footage of Swift running to kiss him after her “Eras Tour” concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina went viral.",Entertainment
"André 3000 thinks he’s too old to keep rapping. Jay-Z, Eminem and Big Boi would like a word"," André 3000, half of the beloved rap duo Outkast and obscure flute aficionado, hasn’t released a proper solo rap song since he and Big Boi recorded their final album in 2006. André’s fans have relied on memorable but brief features (his verse on Beyoncé’s “Party”) or barely-there snippets (the two words he sings on Kanye West’s “30 Hours”) to hear the rapper’s velvety voice. Now it seems fans will have to keep waiting for Dré’s grand return to rap: In an interview with GQ tied to last week’s release of his instrumental flute record “New Blue Sun,” he said it sometimes “feel inauthentic for me to rap because I don’t have anything to talk about in that way.” “I’m 48 years old. Not to say that age is a thing that dictates what you rap about, but in a way it does,” he told GQ. “What do you talk about — I gotta go get a colonoscopy? What do you rap about — my eyesight is going bad?” Those who have followed the Atlanta favorite since Outkast’s first album nearly 30 years ago would undoubtedly be thrilled to hear Dré rap candidly about aging. But 48 is by no means rap’s retirement age. Genre stalwarts like Jay-Z, Eminem, Missy Elliott, the duos Black Star and Run the Jewels and even former bandmate Big Boi have found material to mine well into their late 40s and early 50s. Others have set rap down to enter new phases of their careers beyond music — Pharrell is leading Louis Vuitton’s men’s division, and Dr. Dre became one of the richest men in rap after he sold his popular headphone brand Beats to Apple for billions of dollars in 2014. André, as ever, is charting his own path, appearing in recent films by acclaimed directors Noah Baumbach and Kelly Reichardt, while still being spotted by fans across the world, often with a woodwind in hand. He even hinted to GQ that he secretly played on some of the flute-heavy tracks released by beloved rappers in the last several years. His new album has courted acclaim for its ambient, engrossing musical landscape. But if André ever decides to return to rap for more than the occasional feature, he’s got plenty of influential artists’ examples to follow. André and Big Boi started recording their debut Outkast record, “Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,” when they were teenagers. That album was about growing up in the South, a region the music industry had long ignored at that time when it came to rap, and the lengths the two had to go through to receive recognition. Their rap matured over several acclaimed albums, and it became more distinctive, too: The 2003 double album “Speakerboxxx/The Love Below” saw the duo recording what were effectively solo albums that explored their respective strengths, and André emerged a master of funk love songs in the vein of Prince, albeit with his own off-center spin. Now, 20 years later, André has debuted another new side, heavy on woodwinds. But aging hasn’t stopped many rappers of his generation from pushing their own boundaries and ascending to new levels of success and acclaim as they age. Jay-Z was 47 when he released “4:44” in 2017, a starkly candid portrait of his marriage, familial history, anti-Black racism and the darker sides of his prodigious success. It was met with glowing reviews, Jay’s best in years, and was rewarded with eight Grammy nominations. “Older” rappers can still produce a prolific output: Run the Jewels, a rap super-duo comprised of frequent Outkast collaborator Killer Mike and indie rapper-producer El-P, have released four albums in 10 years. Mike, 48, came up with Outkast in the Atlanta rap scene in the early 2000s, and he’s since leveled socially conscious lyricism into activism, maintaining his influence across industries. Rappers who take years, even decades, between albums are often met with heightened anticipation despite their absence. Mos Def (who now goes by Yasiin Bey) and Talib Kweli formed their duo Black Star in 1996, when both men were in their early 20s, before launching successful solo careers. They reunited for the 2022 album “No Fear of Time,” promoting it with performances on “Saturday Night Live.” Rolling Stone’s Will Dukes, in a five-star review, called the album “searingly relevant” 24 years after the duo’s debut album. Many rappers are not discarded when they age; they’re celebrated. Jay-Z and LL Cool J were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, with Eminem following in 2022 and Missy Elliott this year. Their inductions came more than 25 years after their respective debut albums, and all, with the exception of LL, have at least featured on tracks in the last two years. And artists like Big Boi, André’s longtime friend and the other half of Outkast, have stayed relevant in rap among changing trends and emerging styles by staying true to themselves. Big Boi’s last solo album, 2017’s “Boomiverse,” was released the same year as Kendrick Lamar’s Pulitzer-winning opus “DAMN.,” Jay-Z’s “4:44” and Migos’ breakthrough “Culture.” Critic Jayson Greene, writing for Pitchfork, praised Big Boi for forgoing hip-hop’s defining trends of the time to make something entirely his own: “Everyone on Boomiverse sounds out of touch and fantastic,” Greene wrote. Outkast fans have largely embraced “New Blue Sun” as a new phase for their beloved Three Stacks, though many of them remain hungry for their favorite rapper to return to rapping. André knows his fans are hungry, too: The opening track to “New Blue Sun” is titled “I Swear, I Really Wanted to Make a ‘Rap’ Album but This Is Literally the Way the Wind Blew Me This Time.” He hasn’t completely starved his listeners, though: Earlier this year, he appeared on  Killer Mike’s album “Michael,” opening the track “Scientists & Engineers” with a meditation on success that includes the following line: “Hope I’m 80 when I get my second wind.” There’s hope for those who desperately miss his idiosyncratic rhymes and dulcet tones that he may one day record a solo album — even if it takes another 30 years.",Entertainment
Axl Rose accused of sexually assaulting former Penthouse model in new lawsuit," Axl Rose, lead singer of the rock band Guns N’ Roses, has been accused of sexually assaulting a Penthouse magazine model in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York. Model and actress Sheila Kennedy, identified as the plaintiff in the complaint, alleges that Rose “violently” sexually assaulted her in 1989 after they met at a New York City nightclub, and is suing the singer for battery, assault, gender-motivated violence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday with the New York State Supreme Court and was obtained by CNN. Kennedy is suing for an unspecified amount. According to the complaint, the incident occurred when Rose “was at the peak of his commercial success,” and alleges he “used his fame, status, and power as a celebrity and performer in the music industry to gain access to manipulate, control, and violently sexually assault Kennedy.” The complaint describes an incident that took place in a New York City hotel room, where Kennedy alleges Rose, now 61, “knocked her to the floor,” dragged her by the hair, restrained her hands and proceeded to sexually assault her “while he was in a sexual, volatile rage.” “Kennedy did not consent and felt overpowered,” the complaint reads. “She understood that the safest thing to do was to lie in bed and wait for Rose to finish assaulting her.” As a result, Kennedy has suffered “severe emotional, physical, financial and psychological distress,” according to the complaint. CNN has reached out to a representative for Rose for comment. “We expect that Sheila Kennedy’s decision to file this suit will be an important turning point for the music industry,” Dr. Ann Olivarius, chair of the executive committee at McAllister Olivarius, said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday. “Her account is unfortunately all too typical of a culture of violence and sexual misconduct that has been allowed to exist in plain sight for decades. It’s not just individual musicians stepping out of line, but an industrial system of enabling them and then covering up their misconduct and crimes, silencing survivors and normalizing sexual assault. We hope Sheila’s bravery helps other victims find their voice.” Kennedy is an actress and a model who has appeared on the cover of the adult magazine Penthouse. In 1983, she was featured as Penthouse’s “Pet of the Year” model. She has previously outlined the allegations against Rose cited in Wednesday’s lawsuit in her 2016 memoir “No One’s Pet.” Rose is the lead singer for Guns N’ Roses, a popular heavy metal rock band that formed in the mid-1980s with founding members Slash, Duff McKagen, Izzy Stradlin, and Steven Adler. Guns N’ Roses has been nominated for three Grammys and is known for hits such as “Sweet Child O’ Mine” and “Paradise City.” Kennedy’s lawsuit was filed under the pretense of the New York’s Adult Survivors Act, which went into effect in late November 2022 and allows adult survivors of sexual abuse to sue their abusers in New York – even if the statute of limitations on their claims had expired. The law has given adult survivors of sexual assault one year to file lawsuits against their perpetrators and is set to expire on November 24.

‘Wish’ tries to thaw out some of Disney’s ‘Frozen’ magic," More than 70 years after Disney had a cricket sing about wishing upon a star, “Wish” picks up that theme, in an animated movie that desperately wants to thaw out some of the studio’s “Frozen” magic. Hailing from members of that movie’s creative team, “Wish” doesn’t quite reach the stars, but it does shine intermittently while introducing another plucky teenage female heroine, gamely voiced by Ariana DeBose. Despite plenty of original songs (courtesy of Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice), “Wish” doesn’t feature the kind of showstopper that had everyone who saw “Frozen” letting go or “Encanto” not talking about Bruno. The movie does however celebrate the power of wishes, and in the process, decades of Disney history. Whether that sort of pleasant but unspectacular production can rekindle box-office magic remains to be seen, but like its predecessors, it’s destined to enjoy a long shelf life. Set in the fictional kingdom of Rosas, the movie features DeBose (an Oscar winner for “West Side Story”) as Asha, a 17-year-old girl who – like her contemporaries – yearns for nothing more than to serve the dashing King Magnifico (Chris Pine). Loved by his people, he uses his magical powers to both protect them and periodically grant wishes at a ceremony that has vague echoes of “Logan’s Run.” After meeting the king, however, Asha realizes that his seemingly benevolent actions actually rob his subjects of what’s most precious to them, an awakening that prompts her to wish upon a star, only to be surprised when the little round-faced fellow – clearly designed to sell about a million plush toys – plummets to Earth, bringing wondrous magic with it. Directed by Chris Buck (“Frozen”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), from a script by another “Frozen” alum, Jennifer Lee, and Allison Moore, “Wish” contains a traditional dollop of anthropomorphic cuteness (the aforementioned Star and Alan Tudyk’s little goat Valentino), which should appeal to younger kids. That said, the movie’s strongest asset lies in Magnifico, who recalls some of Disney’s grand sorcerer villains, with Pine portraying him as both regally self-absorbed, reminiscent of his toothy role in “Into the Woods,” and genuinely malevolent in denying the residents of his kingdom free will. That concept pays off in a strong climactic sequence that elevates the movie, and even has something rather profound to say. Until then, it’s an amiable animated diversion, if one that feels a little too self-conscious about checking off the anticipated boxes without bringing much new to them. Disney has experienced a rough year at the box office, with even Indiana Jones and “The Marvels” falling well short of expectations. Notably, one of its bright spots, Pixar’s “Elemental,” also came in the realm of animation, reflecting that families are still eager to find such alternatives.

Gayle King says Oprah told her to stop begging Jay-Z for an interview," Gayle King says she “groveled” before she scored her recent interview with the press-shy Jay-Z. King said in an interview with Access Hollywood about her attempts to get a sit down with the mega-star that even her bff Oprah Winfrey thought she should give up on her attempts to get him to talk. “Even Oprah said, ‘You are making a damn fool of yourself. Stop asking him. He doesn’t want to do it.’ But I couldn’t let it go,” Gayle said. “I don’t know why he said yes or why he changed his mind … I’m just grateful that he did.” The pair finally met up, and Jay-Z opened up about everything from his career and family life to the hypothetical internet debate about whether a person should choose $500,000 instead of a chance to have lunch with him. “You’ve gotta take the money. You’ve got all that in the music for $10.99,” he said. “I wouldn’t tell you to cut a bad deal. Like, take the $500,000, go buy some albums, and listen to the albums.” Jay-Z met up with King for an exclusive tour of “The Book of HOV,” an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library that explores his work and career. The rare interview aired on CBS.",Entertainment
‘Monarch: Legacy of Monsters’ could use more Godzilla and fewer people," Let’s face it, people generally don’t come to Godzilla-related projects for the actors and drama, which is basically the leap that “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” asks viewers to make. Stretched into a multi-generational Apple TV+ series, the show is as much a Titan-ic soap opera as a monster mash, proving mildly watchable but without enough of the city-leveling antics for which the big guy is known. The most intriguing aspect of “Legacy of Monsters,” as it attempts to build a decades-spanning mythology, involves the character of Lee Shaw, played in the present day by Kurt Russell and in the 1950s by his son, Wyatt Russell. The uncanny resemblance is rendered murkier by the fact the math doesn’t quite work – the elder Shaw would be well into his 90s – which becomes just one more aspect of the slow-developing mystery. The younger Shaw is working for a then-nascent Monarch, serving as the military liaison assigned to protect a married pair of scientists, William and Keiko Randa (Anders Holm and Mari Yamamoto, respectively), investigating strange phenomena related to the existence of Titans – or, Godzilla’s genus of giant creatures. Shaw’s feelings for Keiko, however, cloud the mission, while the trio struggle to fend off military leaders who remain skeptical about their work. That reasonably entertaining thread, alas, oscillates with a modern cohort that includes Keiko’s grown-up grandchildren (“Fast & Furious” co-star Anna Sawai and Ren Watabe) awkwardly brought together by a family secret, before being thrust into this world of big monsters and the threat of massive devastation. Unfortunately, that part of the story doesn’t really hold up its end, mostly due to the indifferent nature of the characters. The 10-episode show does receive a boost when the elder Russell belatedly shows up, like a world-weary Indiana Jones, but frankly, “Monarch” would benefit from more monsters and less of the people – a byproduct, no doubt, of budgetary limitations, since even a lavish TV series can’t compete with the recent made-for-Imax Godzilla/Kong titles on that score. Indeed, the very title “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” implies what becomes clear soon enough – namely, that the series caters to an audience plugged into the deeper mythology surrounding the MonsterVerse and the shadowy organization tasked with protecting the world, which feels at best like a subset of those who watch these things for the action and visual spectacle. For that latter contingent, “Legacy of Monsters” should be mildly entertaining, but even with Apple’s sizable investment, it too often feels like a gigantic donut with a Godzilla-shaped hole in the middle. “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” premieres November 17 on Apple TV+.

I listened to Dolly Parton’s new 2 1/2 hour-long ‘Rockstar’ album in one sitting. This is what I took away," It’s already a vital American truth that Dolly Parton is a national treasure, and has been for decades. When the accolade of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was heaped onto the septuagenarian singer-songwriter-actress-theme park owner and entrepreneur last year, a curious thing happened: Parton said no thank you, as politely as you’d imagine she would, because she didn’t think of herself as a luminary in the world of rock ‘n’ roll. From there, Parton saw a challenge to become a rockstar in her own right, and after her husband suggested she do a rock album, she embarked on the journey, culminating with Friday’s release of her appropriately titled forty-ninth (!!) solo studio album, “Rockstar.” The record is an event, clocking in at over 140 minutes with 30 tracks, plus three bonus songs on the limited edition CD. It calls to mind a not-too-long-ago era when albums were cohesive pieces of content (remember the concept of a “concept album”?). “Rockstar” starts out gamely enough, with the original opening title track featuring Richie Sambora and including some spoken vocals that clue the listener in to the idea this is a rock album Parton wanted to make since she was a young thing. The second track is also an original song, “World on Fire,” which dutifully tries to ruffle some feathers (like a rockstar would) by commenting on the state of the world today. From there, the album dips heavily into some covers, and because Parton is who she is, it has the distinction of attracting an insane number of collaborators, many coming back to perform their most recognizable song, something most of them would probably not rehash if it weren’t for the chance to rehash with Dolly herself. The results are a mixed bag. “Magic Man (Carl Version)” with Ann Wilson of Heart sounds incredible, while the less energetic “Long As I Can See the Light” with John Fogerty feels somewhat unnecessary. Other missteps include working with Kid Rock on an original track, as well as an equally unnecessary update of Queen’s “We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You.” But it can all be forgiven by some of the “Rockstar’s” shiniest baubles, like Parton’s transcendent rendition of Prince’s “Purple Rain,” a version that feels respectful and pared down in a way that showcases her still-steely vocals. The thought occurred to me that I hadn’t heard a cover of “Purple Rain” … perhaps ever, because who would dare attempt such a thing since Prince left us? Dolly would, and it’s a good thing she did. Another shining moment is Parton’s duet with her goddaughter Miley Cyrus for a gorgeous rework of the latter’s 2013 hit “Wrecking Ball” we didn’t know we needed. To say Dolly lets her hair down on “Rockstar” would be an understatement, with fun moments including original team-ups with Stevie Nicks, Melissa Etheridge and Ronnie McDowell – the latter for a spirited tribute to Elvis Presley – in which their banter back and forth is just as engaging as the actual singing. Her cover of “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” by The Rolling Stones benefits from some new blood, brought by Pink and Brandi Carlile, while the immediate recognizability of songs like “Baby I Love Your Way” by Peter Frampton and “Keep on Loving You” by Kevin Cronin of REO Speedwagon make the album almost feel like a piece of sterling karaoke – and why should it be considered a bad thing?? (And yes, Frampton and Cronin come back for their respective ballads with Parton.) Some song selections, like Elton John’s “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down On Me,” resuscitate the age-old conversation of what actually defines a rock ‘n’ roll song, but the experiment pays off thanks to Parton’s commitment. Then there’s the nearly 8-minute-long take on “Stairway to Heaven,” featuring none other than Lizzo on her flute, which has its own name, Sasha Flute. It’s a combination of elements leading to something magical, even with the marked absence of the surviving members of Led Zeppelin. All in all, it’s clear this was a labor of love for Parton, as heard evidently enough on tracks such as her revisit of 4 Non Blondes’ “What’s Up?” featuring Linda Perry and “Heartbreaker” with Pat Benatar and Neil Geraldo. While the immediate effect of listening to covers like these may elicit a smirk – like, really? She chose that one?! – Parton’s trademark ever-earnest nature comes through on the record in a way that is entirely hers, even with a staggering 21 cover songs in the tracklist.",Entertainment
How ‘The Day After’ brought Americans together – and helped end the Cold War," On November 20, 1983, a record audience estimated at more than 100 million Americans assembled in a very different TV era to watch a “What if?” movie about nuclear annihilation. That made-for-TV film, “The Day After,” not only served as a highwater mark for the genre but almost surely contributed to hastening the end of the Cold War. Even before the movie aired, the subject matter alarmed the Reagan White House, which feared the depiction of a nuclear strike and its effects on a group of people in Kansas might shake America’s resolve and potentially cause panic. The dialogue between the administration and ABC executives included reports President Ronald Reagan asked ABC’s chairman, Leonard Goldenson, to “bury the movie” over a game of golf. “The Day After” was the brainchild of then-ABC Entertainment chief Brandon Stoddard, inspired in part by the 1979 movie “The China Syndrome,” which imagined a possible meltdown at a nuclear plant – and received a real-life boost from an unsettling episode at the Three Mile Island facility weeks after the film opened. In an interview for the Television Academy’s Archives of American Television, Stoddard, who died in 2014, recalled that advertisers were “terrified to be in the movie,” which carried only 12 minutes of commercials, and went ad-free the last 45 minutes when the bombs fell. “The Day After” didn’t air in a vacuum. It premiered the same year as the movies “WarGames,” which dealt with a nuclear threat caused by artificial intelligence; and “Testament,” a quietly devastating PBS production that also played in theaters. Still, the ABC presentation brought the horror directly into living rooms on a mass scale. According to Nielsen research, 46% of all US homes tuned in. The network followed the movie with a special broadcast of a news program hosted by Ted Koppel, “Viewpoint,” addressing the anxieties that the movie reflected – and provoked. The huge audience for “The Day After” – second only to the “MASH” finale earlier that year among entertainment programs (thus excluding Super Bowls) – reached the country and influenced public opinion in ways that seem almost unimaginable in a streaming age characterized by an abundance of content and the fragmented viewing that goes with it. David Craig, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School, documents the movie’s impact in a new book, “Apocalypse Television: How ‘The Day After’ Helped End the Cold War.” A veteran producer of TV movies, Craig became interested in the commitment by Stoddard and his team to use television to tell important stories, leveraging their successes with more commercial fare that “afforded them the chance to once in a while put everything on the line for something like this,” he told CNN. The book also explores the effect “The Day After” had on Reagan and the country at large, with Craig’s reporting suggesting that Reagan – who, given his background in movies, famously saw and described the world through cinematic narratives – changed the tone of his rhetoric within weeks of the broadcast, later finding a receptive counterpart in the Soviet Union’s Mikhail Gorbachev. “In a way, I believe the movie finally gave Reagan the license to come out as a nuclear abolitionist,” Craig said. In a foreword to Craig’s book Robert Iger, the current Disney CEO who replaced Stoddard as president of ABC Entertainment, lauded his predecessor for having “harnessed the power of the medium to educate the public and raise awareness, while still delivering ratings and profits to the network.” The Cold War would end, at least in that form, but so would the dominance of the Big Three networks – and the prevalence of shared viewing experiences – that “The Day After” so vividly illustrated. (The FX series “The Americans,” about Soviet spies operating in the US, dramatized the powerful reaction the movie unleashed in a 2016 episode.) “The Day After” made its debut not only during the arms race but the peak of broadcast TV, epitomized in the 1970s and ‘80s by programs like “Roots” and “Dallas’” “Who Shot J.R.?” episode, which also amassed huge audiences. “After 1983,” Iger wrote, “the arrival of cable, streaming services, and the atomizing effect of the Internet meant that television would never be the same.”",Entertainment
‘Rustin’ dutifully gives the March on Washington leader an overdue showcase," Giving an unsung hero of the civil-rights movement his overdue moment, “Rustin” shines a flattering if dutiful spotlight on Bayard Rustin – the ally of Martin Luther King Jr. who organized the March on Washington – in a movie biography that isn’t as good as Colman Domingo’s central performance. Despite a glittering pedigree, the result is an earnest film deficient in the inspirational qualities of its subject matter. The “why” of Rustin’s dismissal by history resided in his status as an openly gay (or as openly as the world would allow) Black man in the 1960s, as well as political jockeying within the movement. The latter included skepticism regarding King (played by Aml Ameen) from congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (Jeffrey Wright), and intense pressure to mount an event that would bring out enough people and celebrities to gain the attention of the Kennedy administration. Rustin, meanwhile, deals with personal distractions, including his attraction a married pastor (Johnny Ramey) grappling with inconvenient secrets about himself, a detour from the focus on the march that doesn’t add as much to the story as it should. Domingo (“Fear the Walking Dead”) gets past Rustin’s distinctive mannerisms and voice (as well as makeup reflecting old injuries) to the man underneath, one committed to the cause, stirred by his partnership with King and essentially resigned to occupying a back seat in terms of his public profile because of who he was. Still, he didn’t suffer from self-doubts about his contributions and value, laying them out to naysayers – while his appreciative staff looks on – in one of the film’s better scenes. As for the pedigree, in addition to acclaimed stage director George C. Wolfe working from a script by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black (“Milk”), the producers include Barack and Michelle Obama under their Higher Ground production banner. (Obama posthumously honored Rustin with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.) Yet if “Rustin” provides its namesake recognition he was largely denied in life, it does so in a somewhat paint-by-numbers package, creating few memorable moments from anyone beyond Domingo despite a supporting cast that also includes Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, Audra McDonald and CCH Pounder in relatively small roles. Landing on Netflix after the obligatory theatrical run, “Rustin” finally works better as history than it does as drama. While its namesake might have assisted King’s rise to the mountaintop, in cinematic terms, the movie occupies a tier somewhere below it. “Rustin” premieres November 17 on Netflix. It’s rated PG-13.",Entertainment
Gwyneth Paltrow explains why she ‘stepped away’ from acting after Apple’s birth," Gwyneth Paltrow is talking about how becoming a mother influenced her professional choices. In a cover story interview with People magazine, the Goop founder said she’s not fully appeared in a movie since the birth of her first child, her 19-year-old daughter, Apple. “I really stepped away from acting when Apple was born,” Paltrow said. “The last time I was in every scene of a movie was when I was pregnant with her.” Paltrow shares her daughter and 17-year-old son with ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. Motherhood changed her she said. “When I had her, it just, everything felt redefined for me, and I thought, ‘I’m not sure that I want to do this so much as a career,” Paltrow said of acting. “I definitely don’t want to…I’m not going to go away for months on end.’” It’s not the first time she talked about her look-alike daughter. Paltrow told Bustle that Apple is “more girly than I am.” “It’s great because she’s plugged into the cool stuff, and not the rubbish-y, depressing part of our culture,” Paltrow told the outlet. “We were FaceTiming yesterday and she was telling me how she uses all the Goop products. I never pushed anything, but over time she’s just migrated over to it, and so I was beaming from ear to ear.” She formed the lifestyle brand Goop in 2008.",Entertainment
David Letterman returns to ‘The Late Show’," David Letterman’s return to the Ed Sullivan Theater earned him a standing ovation. The former late-night talk show host was back at his old stomping grounds for his first time as a guest on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” In the episode which aired Monday night, Letterman came out to a crowd on their feet in raucous cheers and chants of “Da-vid, Da-vid!” “What happened? What are they doing now? Is there going to be trouble?” Letterman joked before quipping, “Stephen, control your people.” “I will say this is the most enthusiastic audience I have been near since the night I announced I was quitting,” Letterman teased. He departed “The Late Show” in 2015 after 22 years hosting. Letterman remarked on the nice the dressing rooms, the generational differences on the show compared to when he was there, and suggested that he was famed talk show host Ed Sullivan (who died in 1974). “That got me right in,” Letterman joked. “By the way, congratulations on the great success you and your staff have had,” Letterman told Colbert, who took over for him when he left. “It must be very, very gratifying and as a handful of people recognized, it’s not easy, but you make it look very easy. So, again, congratulations to you and the entire staff.” The comedian has hardly been retired since he left the late night. Letterman has hosted the Netflix series “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” - which is how Colbert introduced him on Monday night - and has made appearances on several other talk shows, including “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” But it was the return to his former studio which stoked the most excitement. Letterman wished his wife an happy birthday and touched on some of what he misses about hosting “The Late Show.” “I miss everything. I mean mostly, it’s fun,” he said. “Very few things in life provide one the opportunity. And I can’t speak for you or to you on this topic, but for me, if you muck one up 24 hours later you get to try again.” Letterman and Colbert also recreated the selfie they took in 2014 when it was announced that Colbert would be taking over for Letterman.",Entertainment
Colombian superstar Shakira settles tax evasion suit with Spanish authorities," Colombian superstar Shakira settled her tax evasion suit with the Spanish authorities on Monday, avoiding a trial that was due to start that day. The Grammy-winning singer admitted the charges against her and agreed to pay the amount owed in full and an additional fine, according to a statement released by the Barcelona prosecutor’s office on Monday afternoon. She paid a total of €17.5 million ($19 million), an amount composed of the taxes she owed plus interest, as well as a fine of €7.3 million ($8 million), the statement said. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of more than eight years in prison if Shakira were convicted on all six counts of tax fraud. But the settlement said that, instead of prison, she would pay additional fines of about $437 a day for a three-year sentence, or just over $470,000. Monday’s court proceedings lasted about 10 minutes, during which time the judge announced a last-minute agreement submitted by all parties to avoid trial. Shakira was asked by the judge if she was aware of the deal and the latest fines agreed, to which the singer responded “yes.” A statement released by the singer’s communication team shortly afterward announced her lawyers reached an agreement to end a tax case that covered the years between 2012 and 2014. Shakira said in a statement that she “was ready to face trial and defend my innocence,” but came “to the conclusion that it is not a triumph to win if the price is that (they) steal so many years of life.” “I had two options: keep fighting until the end, taking my peace of mind and that of my children, stop making songs, albums and tours, without being able to enjoy my career and the things I like; or agree, close and leave this chapter of my life behind, looking forward (to the future),” she added. Spanish prosecutors had alleged the Colombian singer failed to pay personal income and wealth tax between 2012 and 2014, currently valued at about $15.6 million. In a 2021 ruling, Judge Marco Jesús Juberías said Shakira lived in Spain for more than 200 days in each of those three years, making her liable to pay taxes. Spain’s tax code states that anyone who resides in the country for at least six months and a day – or 183 days – in a given year is liable to pay taxes. The star disputed that, calling the accusations “false” in an interview with Elle magazine in September 2022. “First of all, I didn’t spend 183 days per year at that time at all. I was busy fulfilling my professional commitments around the world. Second, I’ve paid everything they claimed I owed, even before they filed a lawsuit. So as of today, I owe zero to them,” the artist told the magazine, adding she would have her day in court as “a matter of principle.”",Entertainment

Bradley Cooper practiced six years for six minutes of conducting in ‘Maestro’," Talk about commitment. Bradley Cooper has revealed more about some of his preparation to play composer Leonard Bernstein in the film, “Maestro.” According to IndieWire, the actor discussed it during a Los Angeles screening for the film that included a conversation moderated by “Hamilton” Tony-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. Cooper broke down a scene in which Bernstein famously conducted the 1976 London Symphony Orchestra in Ely Cathedral. “That scene I was so worried about because we did it live,” he said. “That was the London Symphony Orchestra. I was recorded live, I had to conduct them. And I spent six years learning how to conduct six minutes and 21 seconds of music.” Whew. Now that is method acting. Cooper, who also directed the film and co-wrote the script, said he watched raw footage of Bernstein conducting at the event to replicate it as authentically as possible. “It was really about dialing exactly what I wanted cinematically and then inviting them into then inhabit that space and trusting that they have all done the work,” he said. “Because I think that I knew, I was terrified, absolutely terrified that if I hadn’t done the work that I wouldn’t be able to enjoy myself in these scenes. And everybody did.” Cooper has faced criticism for the prosthetic nose he wears in the film to portray Bernstein, who was Jewish, despite members of the composer’s own family defending the choice. “Maestro” will have a limited theatrical release on Nov. 22 before it starts streaming on Netflix in December.",Entertainment
‘Modern Family’ cast reunited with one notable absence," The cast of “Modern Family” reunited for the first time since the show ended in 2020, but not everyone made it.

We even had our two dads [co-creators] Chris Lloyd and Steve Levitan there!” One person who wasn’t present was actor Ty Burrell, who played dad Phil Dunphy on the popular ABC show for its 11 seasons. That sparked concern that he was unwell, especially because in the group photo, Ariel Winter, who played his daughter Alex, is seen holding a photo of Burrell and Vergara posted a video in which cast members express to the picture that they miss Burrell. But all appears to be well. “For 11 years we would take family pictures for Modern Family and without missing one ever, I would always say, ‘now let’s do one without Ty.’ Last night Ty couldn’t make it to our little impromptu reunion, so I had to bring his favorite picture of Phil so we could ‘do one without Ty,’” Stonestreet explained in the caption of his set of photos. “Modern Family” is currently streaming on several services including Hulu.",Entertainment
Susan Sarandon is no longer represented by UTA after comments made at pro-Palestinian rally," United Talent Agency, one of Hollywood’s premiere talent agencies, is “no longer representing Susan Sarandon” in light of recent comments she made at a pro-Palestinian rally, a spokesperson for the company told CNN on Tuesday.

‘Fargo’s’ fifth season feels too much like an accent in search of a series," Once you get past the kick of seeing Juno Temple nailing a Minnesota accent, FX’s fifth season of “Fargo” plays like a thin version of the concept, while owing a sizable debt to director David Cronenberg’s “A History of Violence” with its story of a seemingly ordinary family person hiding a secret past. Just like the past is sometimes best left buried, the same principle applies to anthology series short on inspiration. Bearing scant resemblance to her “Ted Lasso” persona, Temple stars as Dot, a midwestern mom who gets arrested at a local political melee, placing her fingerprints into the criminal database and opening her up to those who have been searching to find her. The idea that Dot might have a secret life certainly comes as news to her milquetoast husband (David Rysdahl), while proving a little less surprising to her wealthy mother-in-law, the proprietor of a debt-collection empire. The latter is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh with a sneering drawl that sounds like an exaggerated impression of a 1940s gun moll, cranked up to an 11 or 12 when a nine would surely do. “I’m not your mom,” she snaps at Dot. “You’re married to my son.” Presided over by producer Noah Hawley, who has wrung an impressive amount of mileage out of the Coen brothers’ concept, “Fargo” finds its heavy in Roy Tillman (Jon Hamm), a North Dakota Sheriff who is on Dot’s tail. Hamm milks a fair amount of humor out of the character – a Marlboro Man-type figure who adheres to his own code – while padding his very busy TV resume, which in short order has included “The Morning Show,” “Good Omens” and the upcoming animated series “Grimsburg.” Tillman’s eccentric circle includes his dimwitted son (“Stranger Things’” Joe Keery), who isn’t nearly as tough or clever as he seems to believe; and a hitman named Ole Munch (Sam Spruell), who takes the plot in farcically bizarre directions. Arguably, “Fargo” peaked in its second season, featuring Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons, with subsequent iterations proving diverting enough without reaching those heights. To the extent the latest version delivers a modest kick from its trademark mix of deadpan humor and explosive violence, is it possible to enjoy this season (six of the 10 were made available) strictly on its terms? You betcha. Thus far, though, this feels like a case of an established formula gradually yielding diminishing returns. And while conjuring a mystery about who and what made Dot run and who will survive her sudden exposure, this time the show plays a little too much like an accent in search of a series. “Fargo” premieres November 21 at 10 p.m. ET on FX, streaming the next day on Hulu.",Entertainment
‘Next Goal Wins’ takes a shot with Taika Waititi’s whimsical soccer comedy," Director Taika Waititi’s eclectic resume has ranged from Marvel’s Thor sequels to oddball comedies featuring vampires and Nazis, which makes his latest, the whimsical fact-based sports movie “Next Goal Wins,” notable mostly for how conventional it is. Warm and eager to please, it’s part underdog story, part fish out of water, hitting theaters first but likely to do most of its scoring on the fields of streaming. Premiering the same month “The Killer” landed on Netflix, the movie also represents a change of pace for the versatile Michael Fassbender, who stars as Thomas Rongen, a down-on-his-luck soccer coach essentially forced to take a job overseeing the hapless team from American Samoa. Notorious for giving up a record number of goals, the team receives a modest objective from their organizer (Oscar Kightley) – not to win, but simply to score, something his squad has never done in international play. Fassbender’s tightly wound coach proves an odd fit for an island where everyone obeys the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit and life simultaneously comes to a stop at a preordained time each day for prayer. Plus, the team is populated by an assortment of eccentrics, as well as a trans player, Jaiyah (Kaimana), who Rongen – the film takes place circa 2011 – initially has no idea how to treat or handle. There’s some other business at play, including a woefully underused Elisabeth Moss as Rongen’s estranged wife. Still, “Next Goal Wins” (which actually filmed in Hawaii) mostly exists to violate the old “Seinfeld” “No hugging, no learning” rule, beginning with the simple concept that there might be something more important than winning. Working from a script he co-wrote with Iain Morris, Waititi (who also appears in a small role) as usual rather gleefully toys with expectations, including his version of an inspiring locker-room speech and a training regimen that includes referencing “The Karate Kid” movies. Ultimately, “Next Goal Wins” derives most of its modest charm from the film’s sheer unpretentiousness, which also makes it light enough to feel fairly disposable, despite being equipped with likable characters and scenic locales. Then again, the movie and its makers deserve some credit strictly for taking a chance on this sort of low-key effort, recognizing that while it’s challenging to score with such material, the only way to really find out is to take a shot. “Next Goal Wins” premieres November 17 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13.",Entertainment
‘The Crown’ loses more of its luster as its final season turns to Princess Diana," Blame it on the subject matter, or perhaps merely the difference between more recent events and decades-old ones, but “The Crown” has saved the worst for last, following its disjointed fifth season with a sixth that feels more tabloid-y and less stately. After sweeping the Emmys with the previous iteration of its cast, the Netflix drama looks ready to limp across the finish line unbowed, but slightly bloodied. Splitting the final season into two parts, the first four episodes focus on a pair of relationships in the wake of the divorce that shook the world. Yet because the audience knows what’s coming, there’s an almost morbid quality to this batch of shows, not really helped by the framing device that writer-producer Peter Morgan employs, or the flights of fancy in which he later indulges. While it’s still a splendid cast, center stage inevitably belongs to Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) as she begins her romance with wealthy heir Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla), who, despite being engaged, is egged on by his imperious father Mohamed Al Fayed (Salim Daw) to woo her. The elder man sees the princess as a priceless bauble, one that will bring the family a level of respect that, despite his money, has eluded them. Elsewhere, in one of those epically cringe-y moments, Charles (Dominic West) practically pleads with his mother (Imelda Staunton) to attend the 50th birthday party that he’s throwing for Camilla (Olivia Williams), realizing that the Queen’s presence would go a long way toward validating his companion in the eyes of a skeptical public. Elizabeth and Prince Philip (Jonathan Pryce) have grown even more tone-deaf to the modern demands of the monarchy and can’t hide their irritation over what their son has wrought. For his part, Charles – treated more charitably than in Season 5 – recognizes that he’s in a public-relations battle with his ex, proclaiming to his handlers, “This is war,” before adopting a more measured tone. As for Diana, she experiences the pain of seeing her efforts to do good charitable works eclipsed by the sensational coverage of her personal life. The show also takes time to delineate how the financial incentives dangled in front of the paparazzi – after pictures of her sold for record sums – ultimately led to her death, leaving plenty of accomplices, including the public that ate all that up before pivoting to mourn her. The problem, for anyone who was alive and vaguely sentient in 1997, is that we’ve seen this movie before – indeed, probably multiple versions of it, including documentaries and even a musical. While “The Crown” remains impeccable in its commitment to detail, the nuanced characterizations of the Royals in these latest seasons have occasionally given way to near-caricatures, a description that also applies to the pressure Mohamed Al Fayed exerts on his son. The initial genius of “The Crown” stemmed from its ability to flesh out fascinating chapters in British history, roughly a decade at a time, taking the audience inside the palace walls in a way that humanized – or at least shed light on – the most privileged people on the planet. The fifth season premiered not long after Queen Elizabeth II’s death, which somewhat obscured its shortcomings. Whether it’s the Royals or the filmmakers who lost their golden touch, after all those well-deserved laurels “The Crown” and its perfectly stiff upper lips remain intact, but reputationally, the buildup toward the finish has dulled at least some of its luster. “The Crown” begins its sixth season November 16 on Netflix. The final six episodes will premiere on December 14.",Entertainment
‘Napoleon’ saddles up Joaquin Phoenix to lead the charge in Ridley Scott’s chilly epic," Ridley Scott’s storied career has included directing great (“Gladiator”) and not-so-great (“Kingdom of Heaven,” “The Last Duel”) period epics. “Napoleon” lands somewhere in between, a solid and sweeping version of the French leader’s war-torn life that proves too flat between the action sequences – a shiny bauble with a hollow core – despite the best efforts of Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby. Although the movie’s long, the running time is only about half that of the 5 ½-hour silent classic by the same name, offering some sense of just how much Napoleon story there is to tell. Saddling up behind Joaquin Phoenix – who excels at creepy and eccentric characters, none more so than his take on “Joker” – Scott has found a seemingly ideal candidate to portray the Little Corporal, whose fearsome strategic prowess on the battlefield brought about his rise at the turbulent end of the 18th century, becoming France’s emperor in 1804. That said, there’s not really a whole lot of depth to the character, who his soon-to-be spouse Josephine (Kirby) quickly sizes up as an unmannered brute, telling him, “You are nothing without me,” before getting him to dutifully repeat the phrase. Indeed, the title notwithstanding, “Napoleon” is generally at its best when exploring Josephine’s side of the story, which hinges foremost on her inability to provide Napoleon with the heir that he so desperately wants. That’s in no small part thanks to the alluring yet mysterious quality that Kirby, of “Mission: Impossible” and “The Crown” renown, brings to her. Those tensions at home alternate with Napoleon’s adventures abroad, including, in the movie’s most visually dazzling sequence, the snowy battle at Austerlitz. Working from a script by David Scarpa (with whom he collaborated on “All the Money in the World”), Scott presents those sequences in brutal, unflinching fashion, while capturing the almost feral nature of Napoleon’s military acumen. What doesn’t come through, at least not enough, is the charisma that would prompt so many men to follow him to their deaths. Instead, the character seems defined by his quirkier, odd moments, until the final chapters revealing the hubris – like not heeding warnings about Russian winters – that often goes hand in hand with unfettered power. “Napoleon” also has the distinction of being the second lengthy historical film upon which Apple has placed a very sizable bet this awards season, following another prestige-seeking entry from an octogenarian filmmaker, Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” The aforementioned winter, however, isn’t the only part of “Napoleon” that’s a little too chilly. Perhaps that’s why the film, while technically superb, feels like it wins several battles but doesn’t entirely qualify as a success in terms of the overall war. “Napoleon” premieres November 22 in US theaters and will later play on Apple TV+. It’s rated R. (Disclosure: Lowry’s wife works for a unit of Apple.)",Entertainment
‘The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes’ falls flat in going back to the future," Set 64 years before the movie that launched the cinematic franchise, “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” is the prequel nobody really needed, exploring the origins of Panem’s authoritarian leader Coriolanus Snow. Splitting the movie into three chapters seems appropriate, since the film delivers a trifecta: overwrought, overacted, and overlong. The somewhat intriguing conceit in adapting Suzanne Collins’ novel involves how the Hunger Games came to be, and how the young Snow (played by Donald Sutherland in the earlier movies) essentially descended to the dark side. Unfortunately, this fresh-faced version of Snow (played by British actor Tom Blyth, of the “Billy the Kid” TV series) is a particularly bland construct, joining other privileged young residents of the Capitol in serving as mentors to the youths chosen to compete and die as tributes. Snow’s charge is Lucy Gray Baird (“West Side Story’s” Rachel Zegler, who hopefully will be served better by “Snow White”), who hails from District 12, arriving with a natural flair for playing to the cameras, a killer singing voice and an unfortunately distracting Southern-ish accent. Snow is understandably smitten, and he soon begins scheming to ensure that Lucy survives the deadly competition. Still, that means navigating its eagle-eyed masterminds, Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage, who, as in “Game of Thrones,” both drinks and knows things) and Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the latter appearing to channel Cruella de Vil in her look and line delivery. Keeping Lucy alive won’t be easy. And as Highbottom bluntly tells Snow, the mentors’ task is simply to help create good television, developing “spectacles, not survivors.” Of course, “The Hunger Games” and director Francis Lawrence (who oversaw the three initial sequels) are no strangers to flamboyant performances, which here also includes Jason Schwartzman conjuring a few welcome laughs as Lucky Flickerman, a weatherman turned emcee of the games with a familiar surname. Still, “Songbirds & Snakes” careens all over the place, from its limp romantic aspect to the personalities of the various mentors and tributes, which beyond the central duo barely register. Perhaps that’s why the movie features a whole lot of action and sumptuous sets and still manages to feel like a bit of a bore. In some respects, the chapter format makes the film play like a limited streaming series, which, given the prequel narrative, might have offered a way to better flesh out this dense roster of unknown characters. As is, “The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” might issue a siren song to curious “Hunger Games” fans, but for those on the fringes, it’s not a call worth answering. “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” premieres November 17 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13.",Entertainment
How Usher is preparing for his Super Bowl performance to take it to ‘another level’," It’s a short commute from Usher’s “My Way” residency show to Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where he’s been in heavy rehearsals for the 2024 Super Bowl. The singer will headline the halftime show on Feb. 11 and release his ninth studio album, “Coming Home,” the same day. He’ll then head out on a world tour for much of the year. Usher told CNN in a recent interview that he’s stacked his current schedule to compensate for feeling like he had nowhere to put his creative energy during the pandemic. “I had a lot of energy on reserve,” he said. Getting back on stage, his “comfort zone,” allowed him to “find passion and connection to the world” again, Usher explained. “To be able to have everybody for that first night in a room together, celebrating this music and to just get back to some sense of normalcy, that’s what fueled all of this,” Usher said. While he didn’t take performing for granted before the pandemic, he was eager to return to live performing. “That is my comfort zone,” Usher said. “Making music and being creative and doing other things are true places of passion. I truly do it for the live experience. I’ve always done it for the live experience.” As for his upcoming Super Bowl performance, Usher said his preparation is “more mental than it is physical.” “The physical is obviously just staying in the flow,” he said. “I’m in the middle of the residency, so I happen to already be extremely busy. Now this preparation just kind of pushed it to another level.” While he declined to offer specifics on his plans for the halftime show, Usher said the message will be one of unity. “I’ll be celebrating a multitude of things. I’m celebrating the places I’ve gone. I’m celebrating the inspirations. I’m celebrating the music. I’m celebrating the dance. I’m celebrating the idea of this momentous moment for all the entertainers who played it before and how they managed to bring the world together,” he said. Usher added that he’s focused on giving his all for the 13-minute performance. “I’m gonna be very happy to be able to play that stage. I’ve worked my entire life to be able to,” he said. Among his early calls after it was revealed he’d be performing at the Super Bowl was to Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. Usher asked for her help dressing him for the occasion. “The first thing she asked is what are you wearing,” he laughed. “Had we detected my child’s type 1 diabetes before their diagnosis it could have given us valuable time to prepare,” he said. He hopes to provide people with information on how to get early screenings before any noticeable symptoms. “[This] might’ve made it a lot easier for me to live with the idea that you can have some sense of normalcy,” Usher said. Off stage, Usher is focused on advocacy. He’s a spokesperson for Sanofi’s The 1 Pledge movement, a nationwide education campaign urging families to get screened for type 1 diabetes. He has a child who has type 1 diabetes and said he never stops thinking about it. His family was also top of mind when he named his upcoming album “Coming Home.” “’Coming Home’ is the fact that I’ve gone around the world and not just literally around the world, but musically around the world, creatively around the world, energetically around the world,” Usher explained. “Now, here I am back at this incredible place, where I’m connected in a way that I don’t think I’ve ever been.”",Entertainment
‘Albert Brooks: Defending My Life’ dines out on the career of a comedy genius," The term “genius” gets bandied around too loosely, but the who’s who of voices assembled for “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life” make a strong case for its subject, both as a comedian and filmmaker. Part tribute, part documentary, part “My Dinner With Andre,” the HBO presentation serves as a warm and wonderful trip down memory lane for those who know Brooks’ work, and a grand introduction for those who don’t. Spending much of the documentary in conversation with his former high-school classmate and pal of nearly 60 years, Rob Reiner, who directs with a light touch, Brooks is hailed as “one of the most original thinkers that we’ve ever seen” by Chris Rock, “a shining god of comedy” by David Letterman and a “comedic tornado” by Steven Spielberg. And that’s just in the first 10 minutes. Jon Stewart likens Brooks to Letterman in terms of being “deconstructionist geniuses,” as Reiner dutifully goes back to his and Brooks’ high school underpinnings as the children of famous comedic talent, Carl Reiner and Harry Einstein, respectively. (Einstein went by the stage name Parkyakarkus and famously died after performing at a Friars Club event.) Growing up in show business, their classmates included the children of Groucho Marx, Joey Bishop and actor Lee J. Cobb. Born Albert Einstein (a name that reveals his parents’ sense of humor), Brooks began distinguishing himself as a teenager doing strange conceptual pieces, successfully migrating the act to TV and eventually landing on “The Tonight Show,” where receiving the blessing of Johnny Carson elevated his profile in a way almost nothing else could. “Not until you do Carson do you realize what that was,” Brooks recalls, citing the on-the-street reaction that greeted his first appearance. After abruptly souring on stand-up, Brooks began carving out his path as a filmmaker, with deadpan shorts for “Saturday Night Live” followed by 1979’s “Real Life,” a remarkably prescient satire that anticipated the world of reality television. After that came “Modern Romance” and “Lost in America” in the early-to-mid ’80s, and “Defending Your Life” in 1991. The Brooks-Reiner banter is so understated and natural as to basically feel like eavesdropping on one of their lunches, which practically yields more memories than insights. Most of the latter come courtesy of the other folks interviewed, augmented by clips like Brooks’ ventriloquist shtick or his elephant tamer who has to substitute a frog, a gag that really must be seen to be appreciated. The only understandably false note resides in the title, which plays off one of Brooks’ best films but doesn’t really convey the nature of the exercise. Because there’s nothing defensive about “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,” which is rather a celebration of a talent who, in his chosen field and on his terms, actually managed to live up to his birth name. “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life” premieres November 11 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.",Entertainment
Meet the Season 6 cast of ‘The Crown’," The final season of “The Crown” will return with several new cast members and some familiar faces. Netflix’s royal family drama series will culminate with its sixth season in a two-part series finale beginning on November 16, with part two coming on December 14. “Harry Potter” franchise star Imelda Staunton will make her encore performance as Queen Elizabeth II after starring as the monarch in Season 5. Plus, “The Affair” and “The Wire” star Dominic West returns as then-Prince Charles (who, in real life, was crowned King Charles III after the death of Queen Elizabeth last year), and “Phantom Thread” actor Lesley Manville is back as Princess Margaret. Season 6 of “The Crown” covers Queen Elizabeth’s reign in the 1990s through the aughts, including the time that leads up to the late Princess Diana’s tragic death and the ensuing aftermath. Keep reading to get to know the new and returning cast members for Season 6 of “The Crown.” Elizabeth Debicki as Diana, Princess of WalesElizabeth Debicki returns to portray the late Diana, Princess of Wales, in her final years before her tragic death in 1997. Debicki starred as the “People’s Princess” in Season 5, a performance for which she earned Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. She’s previously appeared in the BBC’s crime series “The Night Manager,” plus two “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” and Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” among others. Khalid Abdalla as Dodi FayedKhalid Abdalla will reprise his role as Dodi Fayed, the son of Egyptian businessman Mohammed Al-Fayed who enters into a highly publicized, and ultimately fatal, relationship with divorcee Princess Diana.

Adballa has previously appeared in 2007’s “The Kite Runner,” Marvel’s “Moon Night” TV series, “Assassin’s Creed” and “Mission Impossible 5.” Meg Bellamy as Kate Middleton﻿Meg Bellamy makes her on-screen debut as Prince William’s then-girlfriend, Kate Middleton in Season 6. The role marks the Berkshire native’s first professional acting gig. According to Hello, Bellamy was offered the role after submitting an audition video in response to an open casting call for “The Crown” put out on social media. She has one credit on IMDb for appearing in a 2021 short titled “The Prince of Savile Row,” but previously held a job as a performer at Legoland in Windsor, according to the Telegraph. Ed McVey as Prince William and Luther Ford as Prince Harry﻿You may recognize newcomer Ed McVey from photos Netflix released in April introducing a first-look at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate Middleton. McVey is a recent drama school graduate with professional experience on the London stage, and will make his TV debut when he appears as Prince William, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Rufus Kampa will appear as the young prince in the season’s early episodes. Luther Ford is an aspiring British filmmaker who will pick up as an older version of Prince Harry after Fflyn Edwards appears as the “spare” in earlier episodes of Season 6. Ford, who will also make his on-screen debut after working behind the camera, told Hero magazine last month that he won the role of Prince Harry after he attended an open casting call “on a bit of whim.” Jonathan Pryce as the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Phillip﻿Returning to portray the late Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, is Jonathan Pryce. Pryce was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance of Prince Philip in Season 5 of “The Crown,” and is a highly celebrated actor. He’s known for roles that include playing Juan Perón in 1996’s “Evita” alongside Madonna, as well as the High Sparrow in “Game of Thrones,” and as Pope Francis in “The Two Popes,” a performance that earned him an Oscar nod in 2020.",Entertainment
OutKast’s André ‘3000’ is releasing an instrumental flute album," André “3000” Benjamin is set to release his debut solo album, “New Blue Sun,” an entirely instrumental album centered around woodwinds. Co-produced by Benjamin and multi-instrumentalist Carlos Niño, the album will feature instrument playing from Nate Mercereau, Surya Botofasina, Deantoni Parks, Diego Gaeta, Matthewdavid, V.C.R, Diego Gaeta, Jesse Peterson, and Mia Doi Todd. According to a press release, the album is a “a celebratory piece of work in the form of a living, breathing, aural organism.” “Over the past decade, André 3000 has lived without anchors, gently floating in a breeze. Blink and you might miss him: There he is in Japan, flashing a bright smile and a peace sign, his other hand holding a custom wooden flute,” the release states. “There he is again, this time in an airport terminal, playing a few spare notes to pass the time. Wait, is that André in SoHo with a latte? Casually walking around like he’s not who he is?” It continues: “André isn’t BigFoot. He isn’t some mythical being living in the hills. He’s very much aware of his legend as an award-winning actor, one-half of the Grammy-winning rap duo OutKast, and master of the show-stopping guest verse.” Benjamin called wind the “most essential element” of his new album, which features his own flute playing throughout. “I’ve been interested in winds for a long time, so it was just a natural progression for me to go into flutes,” he said in a statement. “I just like messing with instruments and I gravitated mostly toward wind.” “New Blue Sun” has some long-running songs with equally long-winded titles. The opening song is 12 minutes and titled, “I Swear, I Really Wanted to Make a Rap Album But This Is Literally the Way the Wind Blew Me This Time.” The album drops November 17 via Epic Records.",Entertainment
‘The Gilded Age’ builds its soapy second season around a fight at the opera," “The Gilded Age” returns for a second (and possibly final) season that feels even more conspicuously like “Downton Abbey Lite.” That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the show remains highly watchable as a finely tailored, lushly decorated soap, with the added benefit of incorporating 19th-century history, like early struggles of the labor movement (timely, given Hollywood’s recent woes) and the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. As in Season 1, there’s a lot going on both upstairs and downstairs around 61st street in 1880s Manhattan, some of it a little clunkier and more hurried during this eight-episode flight. The central conflict boils down to the continuing clash of titans between the new-money Russells and the family’s imperious matriarch Bertha (Carrie Coon, again spectacular), and old-money society heavyweight Mrs. Astor (Donna Murphy), whose battle plays out through dueling opera houses. It all forces the town’s well-heeled citizens to uncomfortably choose sides – with apologies to the Marx brothers, a fight at the opera, if you will. Elsewhere, Bertha’s husband George (Morgan Spector) faces the early pressures of an organized labor movement, and the impulse of the old robber barons, of which he’s one, to crush workers in the face of demands for enhanced safety protocols and shorter workdays. It’s hard to overlook that storyline playing out during a strike that has hobbled Hollywood, even if modern tactics are less bare-knuckled and overtly brutal. As with “Downton,” too, the class struggle generally takes a back seat to more romantic concerns, including a potential love interest for Marian (Louisa Jacobson); Peggy (Denée Benton) facing her own personal and professional complications, after the terrible revelation about her father’s betrayal at the end of the first season; closeted Oscar (Blake Ritson) still seeking a wealthy wife who won’t ask too many questions; and the Russell children’s quests to pair up, with Larry (Harry Richardson) taking an architectural job working for an attractive widow (Laura Benanti, one of several welcome new additions to the cast). Series creator Julian Fellowes again treats the show as a virtual companion to “Downton Abbey,” weaving in real-life events, such as the Bridge, and historical figures like Oscar Wilde and Booker T. Washington, albeit in fleeting appearances. Of course, Marian’s situation plays out under the watchful eye of her aunt Agnes (Christine Baranski), whose acerbic wit and exasperation over shifting societal norms and “the new people” makes her the closest thing to “Downton’s” Dowager Countess that TV currently has to offer, which is practically worth the price of admission by itself. Fellowes (who as usual writes or shares credit on every episode) juggles too many balls to tie them up neatly, but there’s enough closure that it might suffice should “The Gilded Age’s” opera season turn out to be its coda. Despite its various charms and splendid cast, it’s fair to say the series didn’t generate the commercial, awards or critical adulation HBO normally seeks, factors that might prevent another encore. Given the frothy, at worst PG-rated shenanigans that preoccupy these upper-crust New Yorkers and their servants, the series also still feels like something of an outlier for HBO, but an enjoyable one. If that’s not enough to elicit thunderous applause, in keeping with the spirit of the season, it’s certainly worthy of an opera clap. “The Gilded Age” begins its second season October 29 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.",Entertainment
Sylvester Stallone reminisces about his ‘Rocky’ rise in the nostalgic ‘Sly’," Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger can look back and laugh now about their heated rivalry as they once sought to one-up each other in terms of box-office muscle. Give Arnold the edge when it comes to Netflix documentary memoirs, with his eponymous three-parter easily topping “Sly,” a too Stallone-centric rumination on his “Rocky” rise. Simply put, too much of the documentary involves Stallone holding forth regarding his life and career, with a few noteworthy revelations – from fortuitous casting developments on “Rocky” to Dolph Lundgren putting him in the hospital during the making of “Rocky IV” – but also a lot of self-serving and frankly tired insights. Stallone opens up about living with his abusive father, how he started writing out of frustration with the thuggish roles he kept getting offered, and how he turned down what was then a lot of money when making “Rocky” because, while the studio liked the script, they adamantly opposed the idea of him starring in it. As old clips and current interviews remind us, “Rocky” changed Stallone’s life overnight, while relegating his brother, Frank, to the unenviable status of being known as little more than “Rocky’s brother.” Easily forgotten, though, is that Stallone’s efforts to follow that early success yielded failures like “F.I.S.T.” and “Paradise Alley,” before he found a home in the franchise business with the alternating “Rocky” and “Rambo” movies as they piled up sequels and profits. Despite featuring interviews with Schwarzenegger along with “Rocky” co-star Talia Shire, filmmaker and unabashed admirer Quentin Tarantino, and Henry Winkler (who co-starred with Stallone in “The Lords of Flatbush”), director Thomas Zimny (“Springsteen on Broadway”) appears content to let this basically be “The World According to Sly.” The intent, clearly, is to humanize its subject, presenting an older and wiser Stallone blessed with perspective about his drive to rack up theatrical wins. That includes his later-in-life realization about the importance of family (the documentary briefly touches upon the tragic death of his son, Sage, in 2012) and the unresolved issues – primarily about his dad – that found their way into his work. There’s even a short section about his ill-advised forays into lighter fare, like “Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot,” which Schwarzenegger claims he essentially tricked him into doing. Still, the steadfast emphasis on Stallone’s perspective prevents “Sly” from doing as much as it should in contextualizing how his filmography fit into the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s, particularly in the way Rambo and Rocky became Cold War foot soldiers. Simply put, Zimny has sat back and allowed this to feel too much like a licensed product. Like “Arnold,” “Val,” “STILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie” and any number of other nostalgic documentaries unleashed in the last few years, “Sly” possesses value as a pop-culture record, letting an influential talent tell their story to those weaned on their work. Compared to the best of that fertile genre, though, it’s more of a lightweight than a genuine contender. “Sly” premieres November 3 on Netflix.",Entertainment
‘Black Cake’ rises to the challenge of adapting Charmaine Wilkerson’s mystery," Adapting an acclaimed novel that earned praise from, among others, Barack Obama, “Black Cake” serves up a sizable slice of period drama, deflated somewhat by the central character’s less-interesting children. The mix of soap-opera elements and mystery still makes this Hulu production enticing, but not as unreservedly as it could and perhaps should be. Counting Oprah Winfrey as a producer, the limited series is buoyed by star-in-the-making Mia Isaac (whose recent credits include “Not Okay”), playing the young Covey, whose tale is related by her older self (Chipo Chung), posthumously, via a series of recordings left behind for her grown children. Thanks to her father’s financial struggles in their native Jamaica, the teenage Covey was being forced to marry a much-older man to whom her dad (Simon Wan) owed money, leaving him bearing the pain and shame of having “sold your little girl.” When the would-be groom suspiciously dies on their wedding day, Covey flees to Scotland, then England, enduring various ordeals and tragedies as a stranger in a strange land during the even more overt racism and sexism of the 1960s. Through her attorney (Glynn Turman), Covey – now known as Eleanor – shares all this as part of presenting her will to her daughter Benny (Adrienne Warren), who has been estranged from the family; and son Byron (Ashley Thomas), who understandably resented his sister’s absence, which included missing their father’s funeral. While Covey’s plight, and the lingering mystery about what actually happened at her wedding, remains consistently engrossing, the present-day issues surrounding her kids – from Benny’s domineering boyfriend (Elliot Cowan) to Byron trying to find his place in the corporate hierarchy – prove more stilted and heavy-handed, making “Black Cake” feel as if it’s simply killing time until the narrative shifts back to Covey’s story. Working from Charmaine Wilkerson’s book, showrunner Marissa Jo Cerar (who teamed with Warren on ABC’s “Women of the Movement” about Mamie Till-Mobley) nicely teases that out over the eight episodes, aided by the twists and turns that punctuate the story. The narration preserves the literary feel of the production, while revealing the heartbreak and regrets that Covey/Eleanor kept locked away. “You can’t run from who you really are,” the mother explains to her children in voiceover. “Eventually, the truth will surface.” Coming on the heels of another solid mystery in “The Other Black Girl,” Hulu has burnished its credentials as a platform showcasing diverse talent. “Black Cake” doesn’t possess the sort of consistency that would put it on the top tier of limited series, but the during portions featuring Isaac it rises to the occasion. “Black Cake” premieres November 1 on Hulu.",Entertainment
"‘Saltburn’ director Emerald Fennell explores the dark side of the British ruling class: ‘Everything is personal, isn’t it?’"," Emerald Fennell knew exactly what she was doing, dressing Jacob Elordi like that. The “Euphoria” actor is having a busy fall. First, Elordi was Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola’s “Priscilla,” now he stars in “Saltburn,” Fennell’s latest provocation, playing Felix, an aristocrat who takes a fellow student under his wing for a hot and heavy summer at the titular family estate. Felix is a magnetic presence – one not unfamiliar to the writer-director. “Look, if you’re asking if I’ve fallen for a man with a Livestrong bracelet and an eyebrow piercing, then the answer is yes. We’re all human,” Fennell told CNN in a recent interview. “When I saw Jacob for the first time in his outfit as Felix, I thought, ‘Not again. I won’t fall for this again, sir. Nice try.’” Fennell, an Oscar winner for “Promising Young Woman” (2020), might not have been taken in by Elordi’s ghost of lotharios past, but she’s quite content to turn him loose on audiences. Part Dickie from “The Talented Mr Ripley,” part Sebastian from “Brideshead Revisited,” the immensely privileged Felix is played with an easy charm by the Australian actor. It’s understandable why the bookish, working-class Oliver – played with a distinctly uneasy charm by Barry Keoghan – is so drawn to him. Who wouldn’t be? “Saltburn” is a film in the British country house gothic tradition, complete with snobbish butler, black-tie dinners, calcified ways and repressed emotions. Far from shying away from her influences, Fennell (of some privilege of her own) cites a semester’s worth of reading material, including “Rebecca,” “Jude the Obscure,” “The Go Between,” “Atonement,” “The Little Stranger,” and “The Line of Beauty.” “All of these works of art exist in the public imagination,” she said. “I like making things that exist in a genre and that play with that genre. And the more specific and precise the genre, the more you can squeeze it.” In Fennell’s satirical take on a tried and tested formula, her two young men meet at Oxford University, circa 2006 (roughly the same time she was there herself). For a generation, her recreation of university life will be transporting. For others, it could baffle. Giants of indie music rubs shoulders with throwaway pop by The Cheeky Girls. Students smoke in pubs, rugby jerseys are elite fashion and the yellow charity band Felix wears is the summer’s most sought-after accessory. “There’s nothing more humanizing than the fashion and the makeup and the social mores of 15 years ago, because it seems demented. Fifteen years ago wherever you are in time is just dire,” said the director. “It was about making sure we treated it like a period drama, being as diligent and slavish as we would be if we were setting something in 1919,” Fennell added. The challenge, she said, was much of what she needed wasn’t in costume warehouses but still in people’s wardrobes; some raiding was was required. Felix, troubled by Oliver’s difficult home life, offers him an escape route with an extended stay at the imposing family home. There Oliver meets Felix’s parents, Richard E. Grant’s retiring Sir James and Rosamund Pike’s scene-stealing Elspeth, a woman with “a complete and utter horror of ugliness,” she declares without irony. There’s also sister Venetia, firmly in her brother’s shadow, and cousin Farleigh, a fellow Oxford student who sees Oliver’s ingratiating tendencies for what they are – partly because they mirror his own. Oliver, a perceptive reader of insecurities, sets about finding ways to grow closer to the family in a cunning act of social mobility. He stalks the corridors of this monument to inherited wealth and status in a fashion that makes it unclear whether he seeks to one day own it or bring it all crumbling down (such is the British complex relating to class, and its cognitive dissonance of aspiration and resentment). As Oliver climbs society’s greasy pole, a psychosexual drama plays out between multiple family members, pushing Keoghan into daring and transgressive places by his director. “Barry is exceptional,” Fennell said. “He is like me: only interested in getting to something sticky, something difficult, something that hasn’t been seen before.” “He’s such a physical actor. He really understands that it’s a visceral experience,” she added. “We were really trying to find those places that make both of us and everyone else gasp.” (Reader, I did. More than once.) Without spoiling the film, Fennell’s screenplay runs riot in the third act – not unlike her previous film, rape revenge drama “Promising Young Woman.” She pushed back on whether to describe what happens in “Saltburn” amounts to a twist (“I think they can feel gimmicky”). Instead, the writer-director said she’s drawn to “that feeling of life getting out of control. And when things get out of control, they get frightening and messy and complicated.” “In most genres, the point of crisis asks to be resolved,” she added. “I’m not sure you can … I suppose for me the third act is always about how we can give some kind of catharsis, while also acknowledging that it’s an impossible thing to do, and that life isn’t really like that.” It’s an intriguing insight into how her storytelling brain works: to know that for Fennell, “Promising Young Woman’s” shocking ending contained a form of wishful thinking. “Saltburn” doesn’t aim for something so excoriating in its satire of class warfare. It’s certainly easier to cheer at the moments it punches up through the social strata than the moments it punches down, but Fennell’s choice to do both is of note. And while there’s some evidence here to suggest she thinks Brits may all be victims of the class system, there’s also a critique of its elite through Oliver, who reflects the same cut-throat psyche that elevated the upper class in the first place. “Everything is personal, isn’t it?” she said, when asked if there was ever a Felix or an Oliver figure in her past. “The only stuff I’m interested in making, really, are examinations of the things that we find uncomfortable in ourselves and in the world,” Fennell added. “I’m never going to be able to completely extricate myself from the thing.” “Saltburn” is released in the UK and on limited release in the US on November 17, before going nationwide on November 22.",Entertainment
Please Don’t Destroy gets a bigger canvas for the same shtick in ‘The Treasure of Foggy Mountain’," Back in the day, Albert Brooks made a nifty transition from producing “Saturday Night Live” shorts to full-blown movies. The Please Don’t Destroy trio don’t fare as well with “Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain,” an irreverent and silly comedy that, keeping NBC’s modern stooges in the family, premieres on its Peacock streaming service. The twentysomething team of Martin Herlihy, John Higgins and Ben Marshall wrote and star in the film, working with director Paul Briganti (another “SNL” product) and producer Judd Apatow. Throw in Conan O’Brien as the lanky Ben’s dad, and there are proverbial adults in the room, though obviously not imposing much serious supervision. Think bigger canvas, same old shtick. The plot, if you can call it that, has Ben, Martin and John embarking on a search for a legendary treasure. Ben is eager to impress his dad (who he works for at a store called Trout Plus), Martin spends a lot of time with his girlfriend (Nichole Sakura) and the hapless John, feeling neglected, really just yearns for an excuse to hang out with his buddies again. Not surprisingly, what ensues has the feel of an assortment of sketches, with John Goodman serving as the narrator and “SNL’s” Bowen Yang popping in as a cult leader they encounter during their travels. As part of the treasure hunt, they also cross paths with park rangers (played by Meg Stalter and X Mayo) and an unusually aggressive hawk, just one of the vaguely surreal moments sprinkled throughout. There’s obviously some talent at work here, but not much in the way of stretching, and the initial energy and sheer dorkiness doesn’t generate enough laughs – some decidedly low-brow (like John’s fascination with videos of mating animals), others cleverer – to sustain a movie. In that sense, Peacock essentially serves as an off-Broadway platform where the gang can workshop their material for potentially bigger projects ahead. Please Don’t Destroy has become a staple of “SNL” with its viral videos, and it’s understandable both that the gang would aspire to try their hands at longer-form content and NBC would want to cultivate that while keeping them in the corporate fold. Seen that way, this “Treasure” could very well yield dividends down the road. For now, “The Treasure of Foggy Mountain” more closely resembles a molehill. “Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain” premieres November 17 on Peacock.",Entertainment
‘Inside Out 2’ teaser introduces a new emotion we can all relate to," Hello, Anxiety! The teaser trailer for “Inside Out 2” has all of the feels and introduces audiences to the new emotion. According to a press release from Disney, the Pixar film features Anxiety joining the other voices in the main character’s brain. “The little voices inside Riley’s head know her inside and out—but next summer, everything changes when Disney and Pixar’s Inside Out 2 introduces a new Emotion: Anxiety,” the release states. “The new character promises to stir things up within headquarters.” “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” director Kelsey Mann said in a statement. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” In the trailer, Riley turns 13 and is still a whirlwind of emotions. Hawke is joined by Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. The film is the sequel to Pixar’s widely successful “Inside Out” that was released in 2015. “Inside Out 2” comes to theaters in June 2024.",Entertainment
"The internet chewed up and spat out Nicolas Cage. With ‘Dream Scenario,’ he’s processing all that"," Nicolas Cage did not choose the meme life. The meme life chose him. The Oscar-winner, he of big acting swings and erratic yet prolific output, is fully aware of what you’re posting about him online. He’s seen the “Nicolas Cage Losing His Shit” compilation video and the other internet detritus that has contributed to his “memefication” (his word). Cage, 59, is not angry, but he is curious about the phenomenon. “I think I might have been the first actor that experienced (this),” he said in a recent video interview with CNN. “It just started growing exponentially and compounding on itself and there was nothing I could do to stop it.” “It wasn’t why I got into making movies,” Cage added, only a touch forlorn. It must be said: many of us have been guilty of jumping on the most asinine takes and drawing the wrong conclusions about this earnest performer, with this writer being no exception. When Cage’s “Renfield” co-star Nicholas Hoult mentioned in an interview earlier this year that the actor had based his Dracula on Anne Bancroft in “The Graduate,” my headline could not have been more locked in if I’d carved it in stone. There’s something undeniably funny about Cage and the sincerity with which he describes his craft sometimes. Particularly when those words are juxtaposed against the sight of him as a delusional literary agent running through the streets of New York hollering, “I’m a vampire, I’m a vampire!” in 1988’s “Vampire’s Kiss.” Or screaming “Not the bees!” as he’s tormented by a cult in “The Wicker Man” from 2006. Or literally any moment he’s channeling John Travolta in 1997’s perennial action classic “Face/Off.” But if we think Nicolas Cage does not demand to be taken seriously, it’s only because we’ve made it so. The internet has shrunken our aperture and reduced him to his most absurd. We forget he has serious chops (see: “Raising Arizona,” “Adaptation.,” “Bringing out the Dead,” “Wild at Heart,” his Oscar-winning turn in “Leaving Las Vegas,” “Moonstruck”… the list goes on). But recently, there’s been something of a Cage reappraisal. First there was “Pig” (2021), in which he went dramatic as a traumatized chef, followed by last year’s “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,” a meta comedy in which he wrestled with his own celebrity by playing an outlandish version of himself. Now we have “Dream Scenario,” combining both Cage the celebrity whose fame stalks and distorts him, and Cage the self-described thespian. In Kristoffer Borgli’s satire, he plays unremarkable academic Paul, who wakes up one morning to learn people have been dreaming about him. Family, friends, students and complete strangers. As the public begins to connect the dots and discovers he’s real, Paul embraces his newfound fame, appearing in interviews and meeting with an agency who want him to front advertising campaigns. Paul’s great aspiration, however, is to find a publisher for his book on ants. But when everyone’s dreams of Paul take a turn, so do Paul’s real-life fortunes, as he’s forced to carry the can for his dream-state behavior. Cage and I are talking over Zoom. It turns out the internet can also deliver the actor unfiltered and unmemed. He’s loquacious and candid, eager to discuss what he calls “one of the best” performances of his career. “It’s in that mode where I felt like I was acting less and being more,” he said. “(In ‘Pig’ – another favorite entry of his within his sprawling oeuvre) I felt like I had access to my emotions. In ‘Dream Scenario,’ I felt that I could apply my life experiences.” He says before he learned of his own viral fame, he “wasn’t very familiar with what you could do with the internet” (he cites T-shirts and Photoshopping without elaboration). Seeing his performances remixed for clicks wouldn’t have been on Cage’s career wish list when chasing his first credits in the early ’80s. Yet once the work’s in public hands, you can’t make a claim on how it’s interpreted. Being at peace with that lack of control is another matter though. “When I read this script, I thought, ‘Well, I think I understand what Paul feels like,’” said Cage. “I’ll just apply those feelings towards this character.” Paul is woefully unprepared for the world he’s entering, but just egotistical enough to think he can steer the runaway train that is his celebrity. “Fame is something that everyone can experience now, both positive and negative,” Cage mused, and “we all know that it can go in many different directions.” “The feelings are profound,” he added, likening it to his past gambling (the actor says he’s quit). “It was like, ‘Wow, I’m on top of the world’ when you won something. But when it turns on you, when you lose, that feeling is more profound that the feeling of winning. And I think you see that in ‘Dream Scenario’ … I think there’s some truth in this movie.” As much a lampoon of fleeting celebrity as cancel culture, the film is not just laugh-out-loud funny, but wincingly so. Watching Paul bungle an affair and a meeting with his academic rival is excruciating, thanks to a game Cage. But when circumstances make him an outcast, the plot – if not the tone – veers towards ’70s paranoid thriller. Paul is reluctant to enter the culture wars but is advised to take “the Jordan Peterson route” and lean into his notoriety. It turns out there’s an equally well-maintained path to fame lurking on the underside of the one he’d previously been walking. In poking fun at cancel culture and the backlash against it, is there a danger the film could be co-opted by some of the same people it’s satirizing? “I can’t really answer that question. I didn’t really see it in those terms either,” said Cage. Later he added, “the audience is going to determine whatever they want to determine. And how they receive it, they’re not wrong. It’s up to them.” Cage reminded me that though there’s parallels between his life and Paul’s, the film is not his baby, it’s Borgli’s. The writer-director, he says, was more interested in bringing to life the ideas of Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung, particularly the collective unconscious. “All our brains are communicating so fast now, with whatever means, whether it’s the phones and computers we all have in our hands, that it’s becoming a kind of reality,” said the actor of this tech-enabled manifestation. If the film’s conclusion offers little comfort for anyone either seeking or avoiding their 15 minutes of fame, at least Cage can find solace in his performance here. With well over 100 screen credits to his name, he’s never done anything quite like this before. “I’m trying to get more personal in the choices I make in terms of filmmaking,” he said. “I feel like if I can get more personal, it becomes more of a connection with the audience.” “My best moments going to the cinema were the moments where I could relate to the character and feel like I was in on the secret that that character was experiencing, whether it was James Dean in ‘East of Eden’ or whoever,” Cage recalled. “I felt it was our own private connection, our own communication between the film performance and the audience member.” “With ‘Pig’ and ‘Dream Scenario,’ I felt like I was giving the audience something – that secret connection,” he added. As is his wont, Cage has a long list of projects in the pipeline. Who knows which, if any, will match this quality. Who knows where that secret connection will next be forged. Though one thing seems certain: it won’t be through a damned meme. “Dream Scenario” is released in the UK and on limited release in the US on November 10, before going nationwide on November 22.",Entertainment
‘The Holdovers’ passes the ‘should see’ test with flying colors," Nothing about “The Holdovers” sounds particularly special, and yet it’s one of director Alexander Payne’s best films – very funny, occasionally touching and a sterling example of the bonds that can be forged by an unlikely family. Set in a stiff New England private school in 1970, it passes the “should see” test with flying colors. Reuniting with “Sideways” star Paul Giamatti, Payne and screenwriter David Hemingson incorporate a touch of “A Christmas Carol” in the plight of the handful of kids attending prep school who can’t go home over the holidays and need to be babysat for the two weeks around Christmas and New Year’s. Giamatti’s Paul Hunham, a history teacher who delights in tormenting his students, has drawn the unenviable assignment — in part as punishment for failing the son of a privileged family, in part because he has nobody to spend the holidays with himself. Also adrift on that island of misfit toys is Angus (newcomer Dominic Sessa), whose newly remarried mother has embarked on a vacation with her rich new husband; and Mary (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, stealing every scene in award-worthy fashion), the school cook, who also faces an empty house with her son having died in Vietnam. The story at the heart of “The Holdovers” transcends place and time, although the hairstyles, well-chosen music and pop-culture references (such as the film “Little Big Man”) sprinkle nifty touches of authenticity that help peg the year. After butting heads in the early going, it seems obvious the relationship between Paul and Angus will thaw during this time together, even if the weather doesn’t. Yet Payne and Hemingson fill the story with surprises, unexpected detours and small revelations that delineate the characters and the origins of their prickly shells. Giamatti has kept plenty busy since Payne had him railing about not drinking Merlot (including the recently ended “Billions”), but this still represents a delightfully snide performance, assuring a student who blurts out that he can’t fail his class that having read his work, he’s pretty sure he can. While small-boned movies of this kind have struggled to ace the box-office test, “The Holdovers” falls into a category (the John Hughes classic “Planes, Trains & Automobiles” comes to mind) set around the holidays but not exactly about them, destined to enjoy a long shelf life and forge their own traditions. In that sense, the movie lives up to both halves of its title: “The Holdovers” gets a hold on you, while looming over most stories built around the simple idea that families are often defined by what you make of them, not what you inherit. “The Holdovers” is expanding its release in US theaters November 3 and November 10. It’s rated R.",Entertainment
How ‘Nightmare Before Christmas’ went from cult classic to beloved Disney property," “The Nightmare Before Christmas” is, today, a proud Disney property. You can find its spindly hero Jack Skellington across Disneyland during Halloween and Christmastime, and his skeletal smile adorns everything from pillowcases to backpacks to Build-a-Bear stuffed creatures. It’s one of the company’s most unique artistic achievements and a proven moneymaker, even 30 years on. In 1993, though, a Halloween-Christmas film hybrid starring a slightly demented but well-meaning skeleton in a bat bowtie who nearly gets Santa killed was no easy sell. Worried the film would frighten young viewers used to “The Little Mermaid” and “Aladdin,” Disney released the film under its Touchstone Pictures banner, reserved for titles with more mature themes than standard Disney fare (a few years earlier, “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” got the same treatment). The film made a modest box office dent upon release. But many viewers who found the film over the years, usually on home video, appreciated its impressive puppets, offbeat rhythm and many seasonal earworms. Audience support led to multiple rereleases, elevating the film from a cult classic to a must-watch movie during both Halloween and Christmas. Thirty years later, Disney has wholeheartedly embraced “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” The company has incorporated the film’s characters into its Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland in California. It’s re-released the film several times. And no longer are Jack Skellington and his motley crew of undead dreamers relegated to Hot Topics and novelty shops — now, “Nightmare” characters are sold as stuffed animals and figurines alongside Ariel and Mickey Mouse. Disney is commemorating the deliciously bizarre film’s 30th anniversary with a theatrical rerelease. Here’s how a small film about a bunch of undead dreamers enchanted viewers — and became an essential offering among Disney’s holiday entertainment. “Nightmare” was masterminded by Henry Selick and Tim Burton, who got their start as animators at Disney in the 1980s. They found it hard to nail Mickey and other Disney stalwarts, preferring to sketch off-kilter characters: “We weren’t the typical Disney people,” Selick told A.frame, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ digital magazine, earlier this month. Burton’s first iteration of “Nightmare” was a poem, populated by ghoulish characters who tried their hand at Christmas. Disney didn’t bite at the time. But after the “Beetlejuice” filmmaker departed the studio and proved his success in helming his first “Batman” film, Disney returned to the project. With Burton directing a “Batman” sequel, Selick was brought on to lead the meticulous stop-motion film, whose production would stretch to over three years, he said. The beefed-up story saw Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King and beloved resident of Halloween Town, yearn for a chance to do something other than scare trick-or-treaters. He finds his chance when he stumbles upon Christmas Town, the cheery center of Santa’s operation. He decides to give the man in red the year off, with disastrous results — the evil Oogie Boogie gets his hands on “Sandy Claws” and puts Christmas in peril. Meanwhile, the living rag-doll Sally, who pines for Jack from afar, helps save Christmas — and Jack’s undead life. Even though Disney execs tapped Selick to bring Burton’s dark-but-big-hearted vision to life, they didn’t expect the film to be a huge hit, Selick told IGN in 2006, ahead of the film’s 13th anniversary rerelease. They feared its cast of murderous child sidekicks, warty witches and a “clown with a tearaway face” would prove too scary for young audiences. “They never felt (“Nightmare”) was a Disney film,” Selick told IGN. “Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, was they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.” “Nightmare” got a wide release on October 29, 1993, without Disney’s name attached. It made $50 million at the US box office in 1993, a mild success (meanwhile, the highest-grossing film of the year and another dark but crowd-pleasing classic, “Jurassic Park,” made over $357 million in its domestic release). It also earned an Oscar nomination for best visual effects, losing to the aforementioned “Jurassic Park.” “​​(It was this initial) small success,” Selick told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018 for the film’s 25th anniversary. “It made double its money, and they made a few toys and it went away. And then it slowly became this other thing.” In the years after its release, “Nightmare” was embraced by audiences at home who found the film on VHS and, later, DVD. It connected with people, even and perhaps especially young viewers, who felt, like Jack, that they were misunderstood or destined for more than their circumstances allowed. Roger Ebert said as much in his glowing three-and-a-half star review of the film in 1993: “This is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.” Disney warmed to the film in the years after its release: In October 2001, Disneyland debuted Haunted Mansion Holiday, a “Nightmare”-themed overlay of the classic Haunted Mansion attraction that featured Jack and company redecorating the spooky home for Christmas. Jack and Halloween Town denizens were also mainstays at stores like Hot Topic, which catered to customers with alternative tastes, where “Nightmare” merchandise was sold year-round. And in 2006, Disney finally released the film under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, this time in 3D, earning more than $8.7 million in the US. “Disney didn’t know what they had, but eventually they figured it out,” Selick told A.frame. “Nightmare” characters now make regular appearances at the Disney parks during Halloween and Christmas, greeting young visitors and appearing on seasonal merchandise. Disney films even more explicitly dealt with death: The popular Pixar film “Coco” starred several skeletons, and the studio even released a fully animated version of “Frankenweenie,” based on Burton’s short film of the same name. Burton has even gone on to direct more children’s films for Disney, including “Alice in Wonderland” and “Dumbo,” his dark streak dampened but still intact. Its cult success also set the stage for other macabre animated children’s films like “Corpse Bride,” also by Burton, “Paranorman” and the Henry Selick-directed “Coraline” — proving, Selick said, that kids’ fare can be dark and age-appropriate. “It wasn’t too dark, too scary,” Selick told IGN. “Kids love to get scared … Even little, little kids, as young as three, a lot of them love (“Nightmare”) and respond well to it.” The latest rerelease has earned over $7 million, and “Nightmare” remains a marquee title on Disney+, where it’s highlighted among family-friendly scares and Christmas classics. Selick and Burton have fended off rumors of a sequel for years, and though Selick has expressed some openness to the idea, he’s content with what he’s made — and the comfort it’s brought to proud weirdos the world over.",Entertainment
Here are the dozen brands that have paused ads on X amid ongoing crisis for Elon Musk’s platform," At least a dozen major brands have halted ad spending on X, formerly Twitter, since its latest advertiser exodus began last week over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech on Elon Musk’s social media platform. Fox Sports, Ubisoft, Axios, TechCrunch and Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media all told CNN in recent days that they’d paused their ad spending on X, joining other large advertisers that jumped ship last week. The ongoing exit of advertisers marks a deepening crisis for X, which was already struggling to woo brands back to the platform following Musk’s takeover last year. And it comes as growing numbers of X users also decamp to alternate platforms. The White House joined Threads this week, giving a boost to Meta’s X competitor. The latest revolt began last week when IBM said it had suspended advertising on X after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters found its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform. IBM’s decision also came after Musk had publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post on X earlier in the week. On Friday, a slew of major media brands including Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and CNN-parent Warner Bros. Discovery followed suit, although they did not specify their reasons for halting advertising on X. Apple also reportedly pulled its ad spend on X as of last week, according to reports from multiple news outlets. X has called on its advertising partners to help protect what it calls “freedom of speech.” The company on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing Media Matters of misrepresenting how likely it is for ads to run alongside extremist content on the site. X also said it had made the pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters ineligible for monetization, meaning ads can no longer be run on their pages. And CEO Linda Yaccarino has continued to tout brand safety controls that the company says can help prevent ads from running beside objectionable content. (Media Matters has vowed to fight the lawsuit from X and says it stands by its reporting.) But the company has done little else to reassure advertisers that its platform is safe. The pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters remain active on the site, along with other far-right and White supremacist accounts, some of whom Musk had reinstated on the platform following his takeover. CNN on Wednesday observed ads for the University of Michigan running on the page of the X account belonging to Richard Spencer, a known White nationalist. (A University of Michigan spokesperson told CNN the university is “watching developments on X closely as we continue to evaluate our use of the platform.”) Musk this week also boosted the years-old, debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that in 2016 prompted a gun-wielding man to fire shots inside a Washington, D.C., pizza shop. Some advertisers have remained on X despite the hate speech concerns. The National Football League — one of the platform’s biggest ad partners — told CNN Tuesday that it had repeatedly expressed concerns about hate speech to X leadership directly, although it has not pulled its spending from the platform. –CNN’s Oliver Darcy, Liam Reilly and Brian Fung contributed to this report.",Tech
OpenAI’s wild week. How the Sam Altman story unfolded," In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week’s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world’s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup’s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he’s back as the company’s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you’re just catching up, here’s what you missed from a week so incredible you’d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI’s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI’s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman’s ouster just minutes before the board’s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what’s next later.” Brockman promptly quit. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.” A key factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI’s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI’s headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman’s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon’s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI’s chief technology officer. In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman’s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company’s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i’m so excited. one team, one mission.” The drama was far from over. The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. “Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.” Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s CEO, the company said on X. “We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft. It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.” Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”",Tech
OpenAI had a confusing week. Who came out on top? And who lost out?," The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future. In some ways, the outcome was a return to the status quo: Sam Altman would be restored as CEO, with the company’s deep and lucrative business partnership with Microsoft, which took a $13 billion stake in the company even as it ramps up its own AI research efforts,  left intact. But in other ways, the agreement is still a watershed moment for OpenAI and the artificial intelligence field writ large. The tumultuous week seems to have resulted in a big victory for Altman personally; proponents of widespread AI adoption; and some of the country’s most established elites. And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks. Sam Altman: A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe. Microsoft: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI. But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed. “One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.” Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross… if it happens.” New board members: In naming ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to OpenAI’s board, the agreement stands to align the company even more closely with the country’s wealthiest and most influential elite. Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering. Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized. The push to slow AI development: OpenAI’s ousted board members: In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: A belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI. In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated. OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor. And after having wowed US lawmakers by calling for AI regulation, Altman will likely continue to be a prominent figure in the global debate over rules for artificial intelligence. Still, deserved or not, the dispute appears to have done long-term damage to the credibility of certain deep skeptics of AI, and lifted the fortunes of the Microsofts and Altmans of the world who are pushing to get artificial intelligence into the hands of the public. And that may have untold ripple effects for AI development for years to come.",Tech
"Spotify to slash royalties for rain sounds, white noise and other non-music tracks"," Spotify’s new royalty system means so-called functional noises like the sound of rainfall will earn significantly less than traditional music files. In an attempt to crack down on “bad actors” using the genre to fraudulently generate revenue, Spotify announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be increasing the minimum track length for functional noise recordings to two minutes, as well as valuing streams of the sounds at a “fraction of the value” of music track streams. A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry. Until now, creators of functional sounds have been able to game Spotify’s streaming system to maximize revenue with minimal effort. Since streaming royalties are paid out partly based on the amount of times a track is played and sounds like white noise are often listened to for hours, Spotify says creators are shortening sounds to as little as 30 seconds (the platform’s current minimum track length) and looping playlists so that the same clip gets listened to over and over again, bumping up streaming numbers and royalty cash outs. While Spotify did not state how much the platform would be devaluing the streams, Billboard reported that functional tracks would now be worth one-fifth of their music counterparts. The functional genre includes nature sounds, white noise, sound effects and silence recordings. “It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof,” Robert Kync, Warner Music Group CEO, said in a May earnings call, a sentiment echoed by other music executives. “Obviously white noise is very different from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ but it, currently under this model, is paid the same,” Marina Guz, chief commercial officer at Endel, an AI-driven functional music company partnered with Universal Music Group, told CNN. Guz explained that there has been rising pressure from labels and artists to change the way Spotify makes distinctions between functional noise and music. “There’s been an ongoing conversation this entire year of the value of music and how something like someone just putting up white noise is different than paying for an artist that had spent a year in the studio making the album with all kinds of instruments and people involved,” Guz told CNN. In another attempt to clamp down on malicious behavior, the platform announced Tuesday it is moving to charge labels and distributors by track when “flagrant” artificial streaming is suspected. Artificial streaming is when streams counts are increased fraudulently, such as through bots. The company is also making changes to its royalty system, moving to only compensate tracks that generate more than 1000 streams. Spotify has also come under scrutiny for white noise podcasts, with Bloomberg reporting in 2023 that podcasts featuring only ambient sounds were accounting for three million daily consumption hours and accidentally being boosted by Spotify’s own algorithm, resulting in a $38 million loss in potential annual profits. Creators of such podcasts could reportedly rake in as much as $18,000 a month in ads, Bloomberg found in 2022. Spotify’s changes will roll out early next year.",Tech
"The NFL, Washington Post, and Walmart: Here are the major companies still advertising on X despite Elon Musk’s antisemitic endorsement"," Some of the world’s most recognizable brands have opted to continue their advertising partnerships with X despite the surge in hate speech on the platform and owner Elon Musk’s continued peddling of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, including an endorsement last week of an antisemitic post. The NFL, Walmart, State Farm, Wendy’s, Office Depot, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, USAA insurance, Formula 1 and Mondelēz International, the maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz Crackers, are among the most recognizable companies that have maintained their relationship with the embattled social media platform amid a swell of controversy. All of the brands have stated company values that would indicate they oppose hate. But outside the NFL, none of the companies responded to CNN’s requests for comment. Brian McCarthy, the NFL’s chief spokesperson, told CNN in a short statement that the sports league “unequivocally denounces all forms of hate speech and discrimination” and had expressed “concerns directly to X.” The decision from the NFL and other companies to continue linking arms with X stands in contrast to how other major brands have responded to the controversy spurred by Musk, who took ownership of the platform formerly known as Twitter last year. Since Musk’s takeover, the platform has reinstated accounts previously banned for harassment and abuse, eliminated verification of authentic information sources and instituted a paid blue checkmark system that has boosted the visibility of racist accounts. Musk has also embraced and fanned the flames of dangerous conspiracy theories, sued an organization exposing the rise in hate speech on the platform, attacked George Soros — a frequent source of antisemitic abuse — and threatened the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group. In recent days, Apple, Disney, IBM, NBCUniversal, Paramount, Fox Sports, Paris Hilton’s 11:11, Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent company) and others have all suspended their advertising campaigns on X. For its part, X said it has removed the ability for certain pro-Nazi accounts to monetize and implemented brand safety controls meant to prevent their ads from running alongside objectionable content. But those assurances have rung hollow as advertisements have continued to be placed on accounts posting hate speech and conspiracy theories. While Musk maintains that he is not antisemitic, industry experts have said that continuing a relationship with X is unwise and could cause brand damage. “Elon introduced unique risks,” marketing industry veteran Lou Paskalis, the founder and chief executive of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory, told CNN. “If I was still running advertising … I would not recommend returning to this platform until three months after he sold it.” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, said it is “irresponsible” for companies to continue marketing their products on X. “It’s self-destructive for any advertiser to be associated with him,” Sonnenfeld told CNN. “It’s pathological.” Musk last week ignited fierce backlash when he backed an antisemitic post that accused Jewish people of “hatred” against White people. His endorsement of the post came as the progressive watchdog Media Matters issued a report that indicated advertisements for major brands appeared next to neo-Nazi hate speech on X. The one-two punch led to an advertiser exodus Friday that has bled into this week. Instead of apologizing for his conduct and acknowledging advertiser concerns, Musk has lashed out at his critics. On Monday, he filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, which said it stood by its reporting and would fight Musk in court. Legal experts have told CNN that the lawsuit is deeply flawed and could open the billionaire up to embarrassing revelations during the discovery process. “This lawsuit is riddled with legal flaws, and it is highly ironic that a platform that touts itself as a beacon of free speech would file a bogus case like this that flatly contradicts basic First Amendment principles and targets free speech by a critic,” First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous CNN. “And in some ways it’s a dream come true for the people at Media Matters,” Boutrous added, “because it could allow them to use the litigation discovery process to force X to divulge all sorts of embarrassing, damaging private information that it would much rather keep secret.” CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report.",Tech
Economist Larry Summers joins the board of OpenAI as ousted CEO Sam Altman returns," Economist Larry Summers, the former Obama and Clinton official, is joining an initial, revamped OpenAI board, as the company welcomes back CEO Sam Altman just days after he was ousted by the previous board. The addition of former Clinton Treasury Secretary Summers — as well as former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chair and the retention of Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo — suggests a major change in the board. Summers brings leadership experience from politics, corporate boards and having served as former president of Harvard University. He currently sits on the board of Block, the company behind Cash App, and the software company Skillsoft. Taylor has lots of experience with tech companies and has two degrees in computer science from Stanford University. He stepped down from his position as co-CEO of Salesforce last year. Prior to Salesforce, Taylor founded and led collaboration platform Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016. Taylor also worked as chief technology officer at Facebook during the company’s IPO. D’Angelo, meanwhile, joined OpenAI’s board in 2018 and remains on it. In high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, he developed music suggestion software along with other students including Mark Zuckerberg. After graduating from the California Institute of Technology, he worked at Facebook as chief technology officer and founded the questions and answers platform Quora in 2009. He was one of the OpenAI board members who voted to oust Altman. However, D’Angelo has praised OpenAI’s unorthodox board structure (non-profit controlled with a for-profit entity within), telling Forbes in January, “my hope is that we can do a lot more good for the world than just become another corporation that gets that big.” Those three directors have significantly more experience than much of the previous board, which abruptly fired Altman late on Friday only to see an employee revolt and wide-ranging repercussions in the tech and business worlds. Days later, OpenAI said it had reached an agreement in principle for Altman to return. The company, which posted the news in the early hours of Tuesday morning, gave few details about what the board structure would ultimately look like, as well as how many members it might eventually include. Nor did the company elaborate on what it meany by calling the three-person board “initial.” Instead, the organization said it was working on what happens from here. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” the company posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “Thank you so much for your patience through this.”",Tech
"OpenAI: The cast of characters of Silicon Valley’s latest, juiciest upheaval"," When technology firm OpenAI ousted its CEO Sam Altman last week with little warning and less explanation, it set off shockwaves throughout Silicon Valley and beyond. Late Tuesday, in a complete reversal, he rejoined the controversial firm he had helped found, effectively bouncing from the board some of the people who had fired him. Altman has served as a poster boy of the company’s groundbreaking efforts in artificial intelligence, including its ChatGPT generative AI product. But the drama pushed a web of other characters key to AI or internet history into view of the public. Some have worked together for years and have invented some of the household name products of the internet. What has made this tale so unusual and so magnetic? The speed at which it went down, the diversity and (relative) youth of the board of directors and the nature of the company — a non-profit thought to become a tremendously profitable one at one point. Marquee names like Elon Must and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella fueled interest, too, as did the long-standing friendships between some of the whiz-kid players. But, perhaps most of all, there appears to be a moral, or at least procedural, split between some past and present OpenAI executives and board members over the considerable threat posed by the technology itself and the people who would control it. With echoes of Shakespearean dramas as well as hit TV series such as “Game of Thrones,” “Billions” and “Succession,” here are some of the characters involved in the boardroom and backroom brawling at OpenAI. Sam Altman Former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman became a household name over the past year as OpenAI’s ChatGPT gained 180 million users seemingly overnight, revolutionizing technology and threatening to turn some industries upside down. Altman, 38, spoke to Congress in May and said, AI technology “can go quite wrong, and we want to be vocal about that.” Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he dropped out of Stanford University to work on a location app called Loopt. That startup was in the first batch of eight at an accelerator called Y Combinator, along with Reddit and a company called Kiko co-founded by OpenAI’s interim head Emmett Shear. Before OpenAI, Altman was president of Y Combinator, mentoring a host of founders and expanding his network in Silicon Valley. Satya Nadella As CEO of Microsoft, a 49% stakeholder in OpenAI, Nadella could have been the biggest loser in Altman’s departure from OpenAI. Then, Nadella’s tweet Monday announcing a new AI division headed by former OpenAI co-founders made him, and Microsoft, a winner. Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday following the announcement after dropping 1.7% in the immediate aftermath of Altman’s firing. With Altman back at OpenAI, its stock is back near an all time high over $379 a share. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. Mira Murati Named by the OpenAI board as Altman’s interim successor on Friday, Murati was replaced by Shear before the weekend was done. After her short stint as interim CEO, Murati signed a letter along with an estimated 700 other OpenAI employees threatening to quit over Altman’s dismissal and calling for the resignation of the board. Murati, 34, CTO of OpenAI, joined the company in 2018. The Albanian-born Murati is in charge of the distribution of image generator DALL-E and text-based ChatGPT. She graduated from Colby College and Dartmouth University and has worked at Tesla. “Mira has helped to scale the company from a startup to one of the most important AI companies in the world,” Nadella wrote in an essay about her for Time magazine in September. Ilya Sutskever In 2019, Brockman, Altman and Sutskever jointly formed OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity that exists within the larger nonprofit company’s structure, which helped take OpenAI to a proposed valuation of $90 billion in just a few years. Sutskever’s fate could be in jeopardy given his role in the board drama. Sutskever is OpenAI’s chief scientist, co-founder and a board member who appears to have played an outsized role in Altman’s firing. Sutskever later signed the employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman and Brockman to return. On Monday, as news of the letter emerged, Sutskever posted an apology on X: “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions,” he said. “I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we’ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.” His future with the company now seems unclear. Adam D’Angelo D’Angelo joined OpenAI’s board in 2018 and will remain on it even after the upheaval. In high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, he developed music suggestion software along with other students including Mark Zuckerberg. After graduating from the California Institute of Technology, he worked at Facebook as chief technology officer and founded the questions and answers platform Quora in 2009. He was one of the OpenAI board members who voted to oust Altman. D’Angelo has praised OpenAI’s unorthodox board structure (non-profit controlled with a for-profit entity within), telling Forbes in January, “my hope is that we can do a lot more good for the world than just become another corporation that gets that big.” Bret Taylor The new board chair at OpenAI, Bret Taylor, was formerly the chair of the board at Twitter that forced Elon Musk to make good on his acquisition attempt. Before that, Taylor was co-CEO at Salesforce and worked at Facebook, Google and other companies. He has two degrees in computer science from Stanford University. Emmett Shear Shear, 40-year-old co-founder of Amazon’s streaming service Twitch, announced Monday he would join OpenAI as interim CEO. He replaced Mira Murati, who was named interim CEO, and held the job for less than 48 hours, after Altman was fired. It’s unclear what his role will be now that Altman is back. A native of Seattle, Washington, and a graduate of Yale University, Shear was one of four co-founders of Justin.tv, an early precursor to Twitch built to livestream the life of Justin Kan, Shear’s childhood friend and classmate. In 2011. Shear was also once a Microsoft intern — though it seems the now-CEO was not a fan. He tweeted in July, “When I was interning for Microsoft every paycheck felt like I was getting the payment for a little chunk of my soul in the mail.” Tasha McCauley McCauley joined the board of OpenAI in 2018 and is chief executive officer of GeoSim Systems, a 3D city modeling company based in Israel. She once served as CEO of a robotics company called Fellow Robots and has been an adjunct senior management scientist at Rand Corporation. Married to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, she serves on the advisory board of the Centre for the Governance of AI. McCauley has a bachelor’s from Bard College and an MBA from the University of Southern California. Greg Brockman Greg Brockman co-founded OpenAI and quit his role as President in protest after Altman’s firing and joined Microsoft Monday. Wednesday morning he said on X, “Returning to OpenAI & getting back to coding tonight.” His exact role is still unclear. Brockman grew up in North Dakota before attending Harvard University and MIT. He dropped out of MIT to work for Stripe, eventually becoming chief technology officer of the payment-processing firm. That startup received investment from Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others in 2011. He left Stripe in 2015 to start OpenAI with Altman and Musk. Helen Toner Toner joined AI’s board in 2021. She is a director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology and previously worked as a senior research analyst at Open Philanthropy, focusing on AI policy and strategy. She lived in Beijing and studied China’s AI ecosystem as a researcher with Centre for the Governance of AI, an organization where she serves on the advisory board. Toner has a bachelor’s in chemical engineering and a master’s in security studies from Georgetown. Joshua Kushner Kushner heads VC firm Thrive Capital and is a major tech investor. Thrive was reportedly leading a funding round in October to buy OpenAI shares at a price that would value the company at $80 billion, according to Crunchbase and other reports. That funding would also have valued shares that OpenAI employees may receive as compensation. Kushner is the brother of Jared Kushner and husband of supermodel Karlie Kloss. His father, Charles Kushner, was pardoned by then-president Donald Trump in 2020 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Kushner co-founded Oscar Health and is a minority owner of the Memphis Grizzlies. He’s an alumnus of Harvard College and Harvard Business School. Larry Summers Summers is an economist who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations including as a Treasury Secretary. He joined the OpenAI board on Wednesday as the company welcomed back Altman and others. Summers brings leadership experience from politics, corporate boards and having served as former president of Harvard University. Shivon Zilis Another previous OpenAI board member, Zilis exited in March. The director at Neuralink, Musk’s brain implant start-up, is the mother of two children with the billionaire, according to Musk biographer Walter Isaacson. In September, she joined the board of directors of Shield AI, a defense technology company building AI pilot technology for aircraft. Born in Canada, Zilis graduated from Yale University. Will Hurd After joining the OpenAI board in 2021, Hurd was the third director to exit in 2023. He left because he was running for President of the United States as a Republican. He dropped out of the race in October and endorsed Nikki Haley. A former Texas congressman and CIA officer, Hurd joined OpenAI while working at investment bank Allen & Company and was seen as bringing public policy expertise. Hurd was born and raised in Texas and graduated from Texas A&M University, where he majored in computer science and was elected student body president. Reid Hoffman LinkedIn co-founder Hoffman left OpenAI’s board in March citing conflicts of interest with other AI ventures. Just two months later, his company Inflection AI unveiled a ChatGPT-like chatbot named Pi. Hoffman was also an early investor in OpenAI. Hoffman and Musk were part of the PayPal founding team before Hoffman became co-founder, CEO and Chairman of LinkedIn. He’s been a tech investor with several firms including a partner at Greylock Partners for the past 14 years. He’s on the board of several companies including Microsoft. He has a bachelor’s from Stanford University and a master’s from Oxford in philosophy. Elon Musk Musk, a co-founder and previous board member of OpenAI, left in 2018 citing a conflict of interest with Tesla. Musk has since expressed safety concerns over AI’s threat to society and the possibility that Microsoft would take over the company. Musk, one of the richest people in the world, leads several companies including SpaceX, Tesla, the Boring Company, and the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk is connected to many characters in the OpenAI drama and has publicly feuded with Altman about the future of AI. “What tangled webs we weave,” he wrote on X, shortly after Altman was announced back at OpenAI early Wednesday morning. This is an ongoing story. It will be updated.",Tech
Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes," Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. “We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker’s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman’s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman’s ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company’s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.” Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” Altman’s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. “Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?” But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI’s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft’s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. — CNN’s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.",Tech
Pro-Nazi posts next to Apple ads: Elon Musk’s X sues watchdog for its damning report," After a devastating advertiser exodus last week involving some of the world’s largest media companies, X owner Elon Musk is suing the progressive watchdog group Media Matters over its analysis highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X — a report that appeared to play a significant role in the massive and highly damaging brand revolt. The lawsuit filed Monday accuses Media Matters of distorting how likely it is for ads to appear beside extremist content on X, alleging that the group’s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site. “Media Matters knowingly and maliciously manufactured side-by-side images depicting advertisers’ posts on X Corp.’s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white-nationalist fringe content and then portrayed these manufactured images as if they were what typical X users experience on the platform,” the complaint filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas said. “Media Matters designed both these images and its resulting media strategy to drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.” The lawsuit marks the latest example of Musk’s favored response to his critics, and seeks to direct blame for the advertiser backlash onto third-party groups after Musk, in the same week, publicly endorsed the antisemitic claim that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.” The lawsuit simultaneously names Media Matters and Eric Hananoki, its senior investigative reporter, as defendants. It calls for a judicial order forcing Media Matters to remove its analysis from its website and accuses Media Matters of interfering with X’s contracts with advertisers, of disrupting their economic relationships and of unlawfully disparaging X. In a statement Monday evening, Media Matters President Angelo Carusone vowed to defend the group against the suit. “This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X’s critics into silence,” Carusone said. “Media Matters stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court.” On Monday evening, X CEO Linda Yaccarino chimed in defending the social media site. “If you know me, you know I’m committed to truth and fairness,” Yaccarino posted. “Here’s the truth. Not a single authentic user on X saw IBM’s, Comcast’s, or Oracle’s ads next to the content in Media Matters’ article.” Following the lawsuit’s filing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton piled on, announcing he would be investigating Media Matters to determine whether its study of content on X might constitute “potential fraudulent activity” under Texas law. He also called the group a “radical left-wing organization” that “would like nothing more than to limit freedom by reducing participation in the public square.” And Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey posted on X that his office was also investigating Media Matters, news to which Musk responded: “Great!” Musk had teased the litigation on Saturday after major brands including Disney, Paramount and CNN’s parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, halted their advertising on X. Musk threatened a “thermonuclear lawsuit” against Media Matters and “ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company,” including, he said in a follow-up post, “their board, their donors, their network of dark money, all of them…” In previewing X’s argument, Musk appeared not to dispute the results of Media Matters’ analysis, instead targeting the group for having created a test account and allegedly refreshing the account until X’s advertising systems ran an ad for a major brand beside extremist content. The result generated by the test would almost never happen in the real world, Musk’s complaint alleged. Legal experts on technology and the First Amendment widely characterized X’s complaint on Monday as weak and opportunistically filed in a court that Musk likely believes will take his side. “It’s one of those lawsuits that’s filed more for symbolism than for substance—as reflected in just how empty the allegations really are, and in where Musk chose to file, singling out the ultra-conservative Northern District of Texas despite its absence of any logical connection to the dispute,” said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst. “The choice of venue can best be described as trying to shore up a weak claim on the merits with a bench more likely to be sympathetic even to weak claims.” “This reads like a press release, not a court filing to me,” said Joan Donovan, a professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University. “X does admit the ads were shown next to hateful content, but argues it was ‘rare.’ This is the same strategy employed by advertisers that got YouTube to demonetize political content in 2017.” One legal expert said the lawsuit could backfire. “This lawsuit is riddled with legal flaws, and it is highly ironic that a platform that touts itself as a beacon of free speech would file a bogus case like this that flatly contradicts basic First Amendment principles and targets free speech by a critic,” First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous told CNN. “And in some ways it’s a dream come true for the people at Media Matters because it could allow them to use the litigation discovery process to force X to divulge all sorts of embarrassing, damaging private information that it would much rather keep secret.” Ken White, a First Amendment lawyer and criminal defense attorney based in Los Angeles, said the decision to file in Texas may have been intended to circumvent laws passed by California, the District of Columbia and dozens of states barring frivolous lawsuits meant to stifle public criticism. “X filed this in federal court in Texas to avoid application of an anti-SLAPP statute,” White said on the X alternative BlueSky, using the acronym that refers to so-called “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” In the federal appeals court that oversees Texas, anti-SLAPP statutes do not apply, White added. “X’s purpose is to harass and abuse and maximize the cost of litigation, and anti-SLAPP statutes interfere with that aim,” he wrote. Monday’s case has been assigned to District Judge Mark Pittman, a Donald Trump appointee who has previously been at the center of some of the nation’s biggest legal battles. Last November, Pittman blocked President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt, one of two such decisions to reach the Supreme Court. Last August, Pittman ruled that a Texas law that bans people ages 18 to 20 from carrying handguns in public is unconstitutional and inconsistent with the Second Amendment and US history.

Microsoft CEO doesn’t dismiss possibility of Sam Altman returning to OpenAI," Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella hinted on Monday that he was still open to Sam Altman rejoining OpenAI – despite an announcement earlier in the day that Altman would join Microsoft’s artificial intelligence innovation division. Nadella said he was “open to both options” when asked in a Monday CNBC interview whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. “Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.” ChatGPT creator OpenAI was thrown into turmoil on Friday when the board abruptly fired Altman. With a $13 billion investment in OpenAI, Microsoft is one of the company’s biggest backers. The firing set off a weekend of chaos: OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman, resigned, and hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit over Altman’s firing. The company appointed an interim CEO, Mira Murati, as well. On Monday, OpenAI announced a new interim CEO, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear – and Microsoft said it would hire Altman. Microsoft’s stock closed at an all-time high after the announcement. Yet in a fluid leadership situation at OpenAI, reports soon emerged that Altman was mulling a return to the company. Nadella reiterated Microsoft’s commitment to OpenAI and to Altman “irrespective of what configuration.” “We obviously want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they’re not going to be at OpenAI,” he said. When asked about Microsoft’s view of OpenAI and possibility of obtaining a board seat, Nadella said, “It’s clear something has to change around the governance.” In a separate interview on Kara Swisher’s “On” podcast Monday, Nadella demurred when asked whether Altman may one day be considered for the CEO role at Microsoft if he joins the company. “Let’s just say it’s fantastic to have lots of capable people who can become CEOs of Microsoft,” Nadella said.",Tech
White House joins Threads as X owner Elon Musk faces backlash over antisemitic embrace," The White House on Monday joined the social media platform Threads, delivering a boost to Meta’s X competitor as Elon Musk faces backlash for endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory. The White House launched its own official account, as well as accounts for the president, first lady, vice president, and second gentleman. Additionally, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign told CNN that the president, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, would launch personal accounts on Threads as well. The move, which the White House said had been in the process for several weeks, comes as Musk and X remain ensnared in controversy over hate speech roiling the platform formerly known as Twitter. Musk himself explicitly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy last week, prompting a stinging denunciation from the White House, a major advertiser exodus, and greater public outrage. The White House’s decision to join Threads gives the Mark Zuckerberg-controlled platform, which Musk has repeatedly assailed, added credibility. It also comes as some key public figures declare that they are switching from X to Threads entirely, citing Musk’s conduct as the impetus for the move.",Tech
"Who is Emmett Shear, OpenAI’s third CEO in three days?"," A sudden and seismic leadership crisis at OpenAI has led to a revolving door of CEOs at the artificial intelligence company, with tech entrepreneur Emmett Shear becoming the latest to take the helm on Monday. Just days earlier, OpenAI’s board abruptly ousted then-CEO Sam Altman, installing Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati as interim CEO. As the “Game of Thrones”-style drama played out over the weekend, questions swirled about Altman’s fate. But by Monday morning, Altman had accepted a job at Microsoft, the tech giant with a sizable investment in OpenAI; Shear was named interim CEO; and hundreds of OpenAI employees — including Murati — were calling for the board’s resignation and threatening to follow Altman to Microsoft. The stunning events of the past 60 hours raise deep questions about the future of OpenAI, the company — with its unusual hybrid structure as a non-profit and for-profit — that first brought the world ChatGPT and jumpstarted a global debate about generative AI’s promise and peril. Now, picking up the pieces at OpenAI will be Shear, the 40-year-old co-founder of the video-game live-streaming company Twitch. On Monday, Shear announced he had accepted the job of interim CEO because he believes OpenAI “is one of the most important companies currently in existence.” Whether it can remain so depends on what Shear does next. After leaving Twitch earlier this year to care for his newborn son, Shear takes the reins of a hollowed-out firm that has lost key co-founders, senior employees and is at risk of losing many more. He will have to deal with a potentially moribund board team that voted to trigger the crisis and that allegedly viewed the hypothetical collapse of OpenAI as a beneficial outcome that would serve the company’s own mission. As he vows to investigate the events that led to Altman’s firing, Shear must not only refocus a shrunken team and salvage the company’s position as a leading AI developer — in an industry that changes radically with Altman’s departure — but also redefine what OpenAI stands for in a sprawling global debate about the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence and how to regulate it. “When the board shared the situation and asked me to take the role, I did not make the decision lightly,” Shear said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Ultimately I felt that I had a duty to help if I could.” Despite being known for launching a social media company that was acquired by Amazon in 2014 for $970 million, Shear has become an increasingly vocal commentator on AI, and some of his prior writings and remarks offer a window into his management style and philosophy on artificial intelligence risks. Shear’s first company, a calendar startup named Kiko, graduated from Y Combinator’s program in 2005, part of an initial batch of companies that also included Reddit and Loopt, a location-based social network founded by Altman. The Yale-educated computer scientist, entrepreneur and investor describes himself as a habitual advisor. He’s spent years guiding fledgling tech companies as a part-time partner at Y Combinator, the startup accelerator once led by Altman. He has a penchant for dispensing nuggets of business wisdom on X, sprinkled throughout other posts about video games and science fiction books. In a 2021 thread reflecting on the 10th anniversary of Twitch’s launch, Shear posted 23 tweets distilling what he’s learned into pithy management lessons such as that “for internet companies, growth is more important than profit.” He also wrote “there are only five growth strategies that exist, and your product probably only fits one.” In more recent podcast appearances, Shear has combined his fondness for high-level, abstract thinking with a tendency toward colorful analogies to chess, Star Trek and early human evolution to articulate his views on AI — particularly on artificial general intelligence, an advanced technology that remains years away but that many researchers in the AI field believe could be the ultimate outcome of their work. Shear has said he resembles many of his Silicon Valley peers in broadly favoring limited regulation of technology, or regulations that can better unlock the promises of innovation. But he has also argued that in the specific case of AI, future improvements in the technology are likely to happen so quickly, and eventually independent of any human intervention, that it could easily overwhelm its creators. “You’ll be able to point the thing we’ve built back at itself … that loop will get tighter and tighter and tighter, and faster and faster and faster, until it can fully self-improve,” Shear said in June, outlining his concerns. “That kind of intelligence is just an intrinsically very dangerous thing, because intelligence is power.” A native of Seattle, Washington, Shear was one of four co-founders of Justin.tv, an early precursor to Twitch that was built to livestream the life of Justin Kan, Shear’s childhood friend and classmate. Though Kan’s experiment with live-streaming his own life to the internet was short-lived, Justin.tv expanded to allow virtually anyone to broadcast real-time video to the web. It organized its content by verticals such as sports and entertainment, but Shear and his co-founders soon saw immense potential in video game content. “People hooked up their Xboxes and started broadcasting. We had never even thought of that,” Shear told Forbes in 2013. In 2011, Justin.tv’s gaming vertical was spun off to become Twitch, the platform now owned by Amazon and favored by tens of millions to watch — and share — real-time video. Gaming is a central focus of the site, but it also promotes podcasts and has categories for art, cooking and other pursuits. Some politicians have used Twitch to connect with voters, particularly during the pandemic. But in taking the reins of OpenAI, Shear is now helping to lead an industry with even more potential economic and political impact. And in September, Shear laid out his stance on a charged debate in AI circles: Whether AI development should “pause” due to its potentially existential risks to human society. “The way you make it safely through a dangerous jungle at night is not to sprint forward at full speed, nor to refuse to proceed forward. You poke your way forward, carefully,” he said, adding: “If we’re at a speed of 10 right now, a pause is reducing to 0. I think we should aim for a 1-2 instead.” Even if artificial intelligence does not become smarter than human intelligence, Shear has argued, it could still wreak havoc in the same way that people can. “Imagine 100,000 of the smartest people you know, all running at 100x real-time speed, and able to communicate with each other instantaneously via, like, telepathy,” he said in September. “Those 100,000 people can credibly take over the world. They don’t have to be smarter than a human.” Those views seem to dovetail with concerns about AI safety that reportedly may have been a factor in the OpenAI board’s firing of Altman, though Shear on Sunday disputed that Altman’s dismissal was “over any specific disagreement on safety” and that “their reasoning was completely different from that.” Still, Shear’s perspectives set the stage for OpenAI to adopt a more cautious approach in its post-Altman future as Altman heads to Microsoft. And that raises its own set of questions about how Shear may manage OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft. Each has reiterated its commitment to the other, as part of a deal that has seen OpenAI’s technology baked into the Bing search engine and Microsoft investing billions into OpenAI. But with Altman and his allies working in-house at Microsoft, Shear — and whomever succeeds him as OpenAI’s permanent CEO — may forever be overshadowed.",Tech
US Marshals serve CEOs of X and Discord with congressional subpoenas ahead of Big Tech child safety hearing," Tech CEOs are once again being summoned to Congress to testify about their business practices — and this time, the US Marshals Service is getting involved. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had subpoenaed three top social media executives — X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Discord CEO Jason Citron — for a Dec. 6 hearing on children’s online safety and content moderation. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew are also expected to testify at the hearing, albeit voluntarily without a subpoena, the lawmakers added in a release, saying that discussions with those companies are ongoing. US Marshals were forced to deliver subpoenas personally to Yaccarino and Citron after the companies declined to accept the summons on their behalf, the committee said, describing the companies’ response as a “remarkable departure from typical practice.” The hearing’s topic reflects policymakers’ steady and mounting criticism against social media companies over everything from hosting extremist speech to allegedly harming the mental health of teen users. “At our February hearing on protecting children’s safety online, we promised Big Tech that they’d have their chance to explain their failures to protect kids. Now’s that chance,” said Sens. Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham, the committee’s top Democrat and Republican, in a statement. In a statement, X said it has been cooperating with the committee. “We have been working in good faith to participate in the Judiciary committee’s hearing on child protection online as safety is our top priority at X,” said Wifredo Fernandez, head of US & Canada government affairs at X. “Today we are communicating our updated availability to participate in a hearing on this important issue.” Discord said in a statement that “keeping our users safe, especially young people, is central to everything we do.” “We have been actively engaging with the Committee on how we can best contribute to this important industry discussion,” Discord added. “We welcome the opportunity to work together as an industry and with the Committee.” Meta declined to comment; the other companies didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",Tech
How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device," A complex but concerning method of gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise. Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Some victims also told the publication their bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps. It’s important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device. From there, a thief could use the passcode to change the device’s Apple ID, turn off “Find my iPhone” so their location can’t be tracked, and then reset the recovery key, a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers. Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user’s security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account. “We sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.” On its website, Apple warns “you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. If you lose both of these items, you could be locked out of your account permanently.” Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.” For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. The first step is protecting the passcode. An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. Device owners should also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it. Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they could successfully change an Apple ID. By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password. Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. This won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen.",Tech
US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible," The US government is planning to change auto emissions standards in a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America. Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out. Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too. It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different. ‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said. At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster. So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said. There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%. Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032. California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market. “California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said. Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable. The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand. “Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.” Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, the BZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company is gearing up factories in Ohio to build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two. GM, on its own, will provide a good test of the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country, posted a statement on its website expressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies. “[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement. At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.",Tech
FBI warns consumers not to use public phone charging stations," The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software. Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to a tweet last week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples. “Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term “juice jacking” to describe the problem. “Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,” Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8, explained to CNN in 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer. If a port is compromised, there’s no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts. “The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,” Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI’s Denver branch, told CNN. “This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling.” The Federal Communications Commission also updated a blog post on Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords. “In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,” according to the FCC blog post. “There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.”",Tech
Remember when Angelina Jolie’s thigh-high slit dress kickstarted the ‘Angelina Effect’?," Remember when Angelina Jolie’s right leg became a viral sensation? It was 2012, and the actress arrived at the 84th Academy Awards in a strapless black velvet dress by Atelier Versace. But this was no ordinary gown: It bore a daring thigh slit — one so high that it artfully unveiled just about the entirety of Jolie’s right leg as she posed confidently for the cameras, one hand firmly planted on her hip. Jolie, then 36, was already a red-carpet fixture. But the moment catapulted her into the viral stratosphere, sparking media fanfare, a string of memes and even social media accounts dedicated entirely to “the right leg.” It wasn’t just her thigh that stole the spotlight that evening, though. Amid the sea of pristine white gowns worn by fellow attendees like Gwyneth Paltrow and Milla Jovovich, Jolie stood out in black. It was a striking departure from the icy palette that prevailed at that year’s Oscars — ironic, given that she’d helped spark the trend by wearing a sumptuous satin white satin Versace creation to the Golden Globes a month earlier. In the room, Jolie’s on-stage leg reveal — while presenting the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay — was well-received, prompting imitations by the award’s winners Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (for “The Descendants”). Rash told reporters backstage that it was not a mockery but a “loving tribute.” Jolie’s Oscars gown was praised widely in the fashion press, with The New Yorker’s Judith Thurman crowning her as the evening’s “best-dressed” for baring her “to die for” legs and Harper’s Bazaar’s Joyann King commending how the actress “embraced her sultry side.” Vogue’s late editor-at-large André Leon Talley, meanwhile, celebrated how she made black velvet “super-sexy with a huge slash, totally eighties Versace style.” But not all critics were on board. The leggy look was described as “boring” in TIME magazine, which gave a score of “right leg: 1, black dress: 0.” An opinion piece published in Philadelphia Magazine described Jolie’s posing as “comical and pathetic,” saying she appeared “aloof, arrogant and snotty.” Her slender leg even sparked some uncomfortable and heated debated over the star’s weight among tabloids and TV pundits, with some observers suggesting that she appeared frail. (Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly described her, on air, as “emaciated.”) As for the court of public opinion? Views were also mixed. A parody Twitter account called @AngiesRightLeg, which has since been deleted, amassed over 34,000 followers in two days, according to Reuters, with posts including “Look at the leg!” and “You have to admit I’m one hell of a leg.” A Glamour magazine survey meanwhile found that around three-quarters of readers were “not into” Jolie’s “pose-y stance.” Jolie later said she hadn’t taken notice of the hype. “I heard something, but I didn’t pay any attention. It’s as simple as being a woman picking a dress you like and having a night, and not really thinking about anything else,” she told The Huffington Post the next month. Some years later, at the premiere of 2019’s “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” Jolie added that the dress had been chosen with comfort in mind. “I think when you feel comfortable, when you feel yourself — which is very much the theme of the film, and we know this in life — you embrace it,” she told Extra on the red carpet. The actress nonetheless managed to foreshadow a fall trend, with labels including Balmain, Azzaro and Jean Paul Gaultier bringing thigh-high slits to their runways less than a month after the Oscars. Other stars, from Chrissy Teigen and Beyoncé to Jennifer Hudson and Nicole Scherzinger, also carried the mantle on that year’s red carpets — a proliferation of exposed thighs that The New York Times dubbed “The Angelina Effect” (a term later reappropriated to describe the spike in women with high risk of breast cancer seeking pre-emptive double mastectomies, a procedure Jolie underwent in 2013). In March of this year, Donatella Versace, the designer behind the dress, fondly reflected on her creation while recounting her favorite Oscars looks in The Wall Street Journal. “Sometimes you don’t know which dress is the best,” she said, “but when you see someone wearing the dress it can become fantastic.” Clearly, Angie was onto something and, as always, put her best foot — or leg — forward.",Style
Red carpet fashion at the Billboard Music Awards 2023," The stars were not quite out in force at the Billboard Music Awards last night, which was held in several live venues across California. Instead, the occasion was a disparate affair with stars appearing remotely from “global locations, in the midst of sold-out tours, and in custom venues,” organizers said. Fans on social media weren’t too happy about the new format, but that didn’t stop singers Mariah Carey, Karol G and Bebe Rexha from strutting their stuff on the various black carpets. Carey was ready to reprise her role as the “Queen of Christmas” in a white pleated crystal trimmed minidress with faux fur lined sleeves, that gave a nod to her outfit in her 1994 hit single “All I want for Christmas is you,” while also bringing some 1960s glam with oversized oval sunglasses and thigh-high boots. Colombian singer songwriter Karol G donned a sheer beige latex two-piece, its reddish-brown sinewy accents alongside the star’s wet-look hair styling giving her a just-out-of-the-shower feel. Meanwhile, songstress Bebe Rexha looked out of this world in a silver and metallic bustier with side train and mermaid skirt, sheer black gloves and a sparkling necklace. See below for some of the looks from the evening’s black carpet.",Style
One of Napoleon’s trademark hats sells for record $2.1 million," One of Napoleon Bonaparte’s famous black hats sold for more than $2 million at an auction in France on Sunday. The €1.932 million ($2.1 million) sale set a record for Napoleon’s trademark two-cornered military dress hats. The French emperor is said to have had about 120 versions of the bicorn headpiece. According to the Osenat auction house in Fontainebleau, which sold the hat, only about 16 remain, with most now housed in museums because of their historical significance. The hat was part of a collection belonging to French industrialist Jean Louis Noisiez that went on sale on Sunday. It is made of black beaver felt and is decorated with a tricolor cockade, or military rosette. According to its online listing, the hat - which sold for more than double its original estimate - was made by a furrier at the emperor’s palace. Napoleon is believed to have worn this particular hat in the middle of his reign. He fixed the cockade to his hat in 1815, on his return to France from his exile in Elba. “People recognized his hat everywhere,” auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat said ahead of the sale. He told Reuters that Napoleon always wore the hat with the corners aligned with his shoulders, while most people at the time wore it with the corners front to back. “When they see it in the battlefields they knew Napoleon was there and when he’s in private he always had it on his head or he had it in his hand or sometimes he threw it on the ground. That was the image, the symbol of the emperor,” he said. In 2018, another version of the hat sold for more than $400,000 at an auction in Lyon, France. According to the De Baecque auction house, which arranged that sale, Napoleon constantly had 12 hats in service, each of which had a three-year life span. Napoleon declared himself emperor of France in 1804 and made a lasting impact on the country as a military leader and ruler, waging wars against many of the European powers of the time. After his defeat by the British at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, he abdicated for the second time and was exiled to the remote island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821. Other items featured in the auction included Napoleon’s vanity set - complete with razor and toothbrush - and a handkerchief he used on St. Helena while he was sick. The sale comes as Ridley Scott’s epic movie, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the diminutive emperor, hits the big screen this week.",Style
World’s ‘most sought-after’ whisky sells for $2.7 million," For those who appreciate the finer tipples in life, a bottle of the world’s “most sought-after Scotch whisky” sold for more than £2.1 million ($2.7 million) Saturday at Sotheby’s in London. The Macallan 1926 is one of just 40 bottles drawn after ageing in sherry casks for 60 years, making it the oldest Macallan vintage ever produced, according to the auction house. Sotheby’s had expected it to raise between £750,000 and £1.2 million ($934,274 and $1.4 million), but were in for a shock when the prized bottle fetched a whooping £2,187,500 ($2,724,967), making it a “new record for any bottle of spirit or wine sold at auction,” the auction house told AFP news agency. Ahead of the sale, Sotheby’s head of whisky Jonny Fowle told AFP that he had tried a small sample. “I tasted a tiny drop - a tiny drop - of this. It’s very rich, it’s got a lot of dried fruit as you would expect, a lot of spice, a lot of wood,” he said, calling it an “incredible” whisky that should not be taken lightly. Of the 40 bottles filled in 1986, none were made available for purchase, with some instead being offered to The Macallan’s top clients, a luxury that adds to its appeal, as evidenced in previous sales of the bottles, its description on Sotheby’s website added. In 2019, Sotheby’s sold a bottle of The Macallan 1926 adorned with one of 14 Fine and Rare labels, for £1.5 million ($1.9 million), at the time making it the most expensive bottle of wine or spirit ever auctioned. Saturday’s sale was one of 12 bottles covered with a label designed by Italian painter Valerio Adami, a bottle of which is also believed to have been destroyed during the 2011 Japanese earthquake. This bottle is also the first of The Macallan 1926 bottles to have undergone reconditioning, carried out by The Macallan Distillery in Scotland before the auction. A further 12 were labelled by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, while the remaining two were released unlabelled. Of the unlabelled, one was hand painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon, and became the first bottle of whiskey to surpass £1 million ($1.2 million) when it sold in 2018 for £1.2 million ($1.5 million), the auction house said on its website.",Style
Miss Nicaragua wins 2023 Miss Universe pageant," Sheynnis Palacios of Nicaragua was crowned the 2023 Miss Universe at the culmination of the annual beauty pageant, which took place on Saturday night in El Salvador’s capital, San Salvador. Anntonia Porsild of Thailand placed as first runner-up. Palacios’ win marks the first-ever time a Nicaraguan woman has won Miss Universe. She had previously represented Nicaragua in the 2017 Teen Miss Universe pageant, placing in the top 10, and in the 2021 Miss World pageant. The winners of 84 countries’ national pageants had competed at this year’s Miss Universe, judged by a panel including model Halima Aden, “Queer Eye” star Carson Kressley, TikTok influencer Avani Gregg and two former Miss Universe winners, Janelle Commissiong of Trinidad & Tobago (Miss Universe 1977) and Iris Mittenaere of France (Miss Universe 2016). Twenty semi-finalists were announced at the beginning of Saturday night’s proceedings following the results of the preliminary competition (and a global fan vote). After the swimsuit round, the field was narrowed to 10 — seeing the elimination of the first “curvy” contestant to make the pageant’s semi finals, Miss Nepal, as well as the first contestant to choose a burkini as their swimsuit, Miss Pakistan. The evening gown round cut the number of contestants in half again. Two rounds of hot topic Q&As then left just three women in contention: Palacios, Porsild and second runner-up Moraya Wilson of Australia. Asked in the final round who she would choose to spend a day in the life of, Palacios chose the 18th-century British philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who she said broke boundaries and “gave an opportunity to many women.” “There are no limitations for women today,” she added, via a translator. Miss Colombia, Camila Avella, and Miss Puerto Rico, Karla Guilfú, rounded out the top five, while another member of the top 10, Spain’s Athenea Pérez, was crowned the pageant’s Miss Congeniality. Palacios succeeds the 2022 Miss Universe, R’Bonney Gabriel of the USA.",Style
The shoe with staying power: Louboutin’s red sole turns 30," When it comes to footwear, there are few signifiers more iconic or more aspirational than Christian Louboutin’s red sole. In the 30 years since its inception, the brand has perhaps done more than any other to transform a piece of footwear into an objet d’art — the design of their heels intended to accentuate the curvature of the foot, the flicker of the red sole almost a naughty wink as the wearer walks away. Worn by the showgirls of the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris and on the catwalks of high-end fashion houses, Pamela Anderson, Lady Gaga and Blake Lively are among Louboutin’s many celebrity fans. “My wardrobe is brimming with Louboutins — the classic black Pigalle stiletto in patent or matte black leather is my go-to shoe,” supermodel Kate Moss told British Vogue in 2014. “I have so many pairs that Christian designed a style with a sharper toe and nail-thin heel, which he named the ‘So Kate.’” “Loubis” have appeared in countless television series and movies too— Carrie Bradshaw famously wore a mismatched pair while vacationing in Los Angeles during an episode of “Sex and the City,” while a custom pair were designed for Miss Piggy in the 2011 film “The Muppets.” Taylor Swift wore crystal-encrusted versions on her Eras tour and Beyoncé has worn the red-soled shoe at Coachella. The brand has even had a shoutout from Cardi B in her chart-topping single “Bodak Yellow.” “I call Mr. Louboutin the greatest showman in footwear,” Footwear News style director Shannon Adducci told CNN Style. “To fans, the red sole equals the height of glamor.” The red soles’ origin story is the stuff of fashion folklore: In 1993, two years after launching his independent business, Louboutin designed a shoe collection inspired by Andy Warhol’s “Flowers” lithograph. The prototype came back featuring a floral motif on a pink stacked heel, but the design didn’t “pop” like Louboutin had hoped. After seeing his assistant painting her nails, the designer had an “aha” moment and took red nail varnish to paint the sole instead. “The color red is a representation of love, passion and life,” Louboutin told CNN Style via email. “It’s strong, noticeable, powerful, and known for attracting good fortune.” The Louboutin aesthetic is both decadent and daring — part Marie Antoinette and part femme fatale. Handcrafted in Italy, the brand’s shoes created not only in leather but using crystal, feathers and even velvet studded with silver strass (similar to rhinestone). But they aren’t for the faint of heart. While they may be highly crafted, they’re also highly priced, costing from around $350 for a pair of Louboutin rubber flip flops to almost $4,000 for thigh-high metallic leather boots. All come with the red sole. They’re also vertiginous, with pumps rising to a heel height of 120mm (4.7in) for that much-admired but notoriously hard-to-walk-in style, the “So Kate.” In platforms, heels soar higher still — the “Maria Frou Alta” measures 160mm (6.5in). “A good shoe is a shoe which makes you feel good, look good, feel confident, engaged, and fierce,” Louboutin told CNN. “A good shoe is the one which brings you joy when you think about it and when you wear it. They transform your body language and attitude. They lift you physically and emotionally. Just like the glass slipper (from Cinderella) makes people dream, I try to make my shoes create the same effect, to allow you to be whatever character you dream to be.” Just don’t expect them to always be comfortable. In an interview with British Vogue in 2012, Louboutin said: “People say I am the king of painful shoes. I don’t want to create painful shoes, but it is not my job to create something comfortable. I try to make high heels as comfortable as they can be, but my priority is design, beauty and sexiness.” Nevertheless, Louboutin has proven they play a strong game and are here for the long haul, even weathering the global loungewear and slippers era that was the pandemic. Earlier this year, a spokesperson for the brand told CNN that: “The popularity of heels remained robust during and after the lockdown period,” while acknowledging that “the pandemic did prompt an appetite for a large range of heeled styles reflecting the change in lifestyle and trends (including) platforms, low and block heels.” In recent years, the brand has increased its offering of flats and trainers — with a Louboutin twist. Sneakers range from elegant white tennis shoes with a red trim and sole, to statement-making chunky leather lug sole treads with stud detailing. But flats haven’t been the only diversification for a brand known for its heels. As well as handbags, kids’ shoes and pet accessories, the house now has a beauty division featuring nail varnishes, lipstick and fragrances all referencing both the red sole and the silhouette of Louboutin’s signature pencil-thin heel. With prices from $60 for a lipstick, it’s still a luxury price point, but it brings a piece of the Louboutin magic a little more within reach. In 2011, men’s footwear burst onto the scene too, bringing the red-bottomed shoes to a whole new (but still financially well-heeled) demographic. From calfskin moccasins with tassel detailing or trompe l’oeil embroidery to slip-on Venetian-style loafers covered in tartan or spikes, the designs were so successful that in 2012, Christian Louboutin opened its first men’s store in Paris. The collection now includes leopard print ankle boots with a 70mm block heel, lug sole sneakers adorned with spikes and patent lace-ups with rhinestone heels. “He brought glamor to men’s footwear and made it okay to make a statement and show off a bit,” Adducci said. Be they men’s or women’s, it’s the soles that most obviously set Louboutins apart from the pack. So when the shoes start to lose their distinctive-hued underneath — which does happen with wear — the brand can step in. Louboutin has company-approved cobblers permitted to restore shoes to their former glory using the house’s closely guarded and much protected signature shade — Pantone 18, also known as “Chinese Red.” Perhaps naturally with something so successful,Indeed, the brand has fought hard to protect itself from other companies trying to benefit from a touch of its red magic. So integral have the soles become to the brand’s DNA that, in 2008, the fashion house applied for — and were granted — a trademark by the US Patent and Trademark Office for what their red soles. Since this trademarking, Louboutin has engaged in multiple complex trademark infringement court cases around the world with brands as diverse as high street retailer Zara and affordable Dutch shoe brand Van Haren to luxury French fashion house YSL — with mixed results. One thing’s for sure, Louboutin fans are brand loyal — even, seemingly, the famous ones. “I once turned down a well-paying ad campaign for a major luxury shoe brand because I have such loyalty to (Christian) both as a designer and friend,” burlesque queen Dita Von Teese told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. “I think Christian is the best shoe designer in the world.”",Style
I needed a new wardrobe after chemo changed my hair. Could Korean-style ‘color analysis’ help?," “You have pretty hair,” my colleague said. “Is it your natural color?” “I…. don’t know?” I responded. That wasn’t supposed to be a funny answer. It was the truth. Three years ago, I went through treatment for cancer. The disease took many things from me — one breast, several lymph nodes and my hair. Healing comes in fragments, and “better” is a relative term. But the easiest visual sign of a person’s recovery comes in the form of hair. Every morning, I poked my head expectantly, like my dormant hairs were plants about to burst forth from the earth. When they finally arrived, the auburn I’d had my whole life was a dark chestnut brown. Formerly stick-straight, my hair was now wavy and flopped up at the ends. This is a common experience for people who have undergone chemotherapy. While chemo kills off cancer cells, it also kills a lot of other cells, including hair follicles. I lost my eyebrows, body hair, and some eyelashes in addition to the hair on top of my head. But chemo can also affect the shape of follicles. It’s a phenomenon so common that there’s a name for it used by patients who report their hair growing curly after treatment: “chemo curls.” Treatment affects everyone differently. Some people have darker or curlier hair at first, then find that their “old” texture and shade return over time. For me, though, this doesn’t seem to be the case. Sometimes, I stare in the mirror not knowing who is looking back at me, or try to figure out why the lighting is so strange in the bathroom. I pull hairs out of my brush and wonder if a friend borrowed it without telling me. My post-cancer body reminds me of the post-puberty one I’d had as a teenager, when my old clothes didn’t look right anymore. The “go-to” black cardigans and pink lipstick suddenly seemed all wrong. As I struggled to figure out what to wear, someone suggested trying a “personal color analysis” session. Already a huge trend in South Korea, the process of analyzing people’s natural color tones has surged in popularity in the past year thanks to TikTok. During the session, a stylist holds sheets of different colored cloths up against your face to see which look best on you. Analysts begin with groups of clothes organized by “warm” and “cool” tones, then carry out close-ups of specific single colors for more precision. It may be fashionable now, but the practice has deep roots. Like many women in the 1980s, Ruth Merrion was introduced to personal color theory by the artist Carole Jackson’s bestselling book “Color Me Beautiful.” In the book, Jackson classified women into one of four categories, based on seasons of the year. These categories became a rough rubric for deciphering which colors would be the most flattering for their clothing and makeup choices. But for Merrion, the book didn’t do enough. Australian-born Merrion had resettled in the UK but struggled to make friends. Later, after studying color theory, she realized that her mistake had been choosing clothes in shades that made her “look about 10 years older,” when she’d been trying to project herself as likeable and confident instead. Later, she wrote her master’s thesis on personal color analysis at Australia’s Curtin University. “I learned a hard lesson that (choosing clothing) is not really about being beautiful,” she said in a Zoom conversation. “It’s about good communication.” As Merrion explains it, the colors we wear are about more than just what’s considered flattering. They’re a quick, visual way of telling the world who we are. The connection between the colors around us and the way we feel has been used to influence everything from prisons (painted in pastel colors in the hope of calming incarcerated people) to food packaging (organic products in earth tones, designed to look more “natural”). Vivian Seo trained in color analysis in her native South Korea and started her company, Find Your Colour, in Hong Kong, where we both live. I went to my session with her expecting some general advice about whether I should wear neutrals or pastels. What I got was a combination of makeover and therapy session, both of which I needed desperately. Seo also starts with the four seasons, but then breaks each one down into four sub-categories: clear, soft, deep and light. Each of those 16 types then has a spectrum of colors that best suit specific people. By that methodology, for example, a “soft winter” person should wear gray tones, while a “light summer” one will look good in bright pinks and purples. My personal color analysis session emphasized the personal. Before pulling out the colored drape cloths, Seo asked about how I wanted to perceive myself and my personal style. I mentioned wanting to look professional and finding some go-to office basics, and wrote down prompt words: “classic,” “elegant,” “healthy.” This is precisely what, Merrion would say, these color analysis sessions truly hinge on — I don’t just want to feel pretty again; I want to telegraph to the world that I’m no longer sick. And it’s not just about hair, either. Seo made notes on my eye color, skin tone, facial structure, and more to craft her analysis. Her diagnosis: I’m a “clear spring,” which means I look best in bright colors. It was hard to imagine giving up black, the uniform of every New Yorker (having spent my professional career in the city before relocating to Asia, there’s a significant amount of black clothes in my wardrobe). But there was incontrovertible evidence in the form of seeing myself in the mirror with a turquoise or bright green drape versus a black one. Growing up, I’d always avoided the color orange, as it clashed with my then-reddish hair. But seeing an orange-red lipstick on myself for the first time — and absolutely adoring it — was an unexpected reminder that getting used to something doesn’t mean it’s true forever. Knowing it can be hard to shake people out of their routines, Seo was quick to mention that she’s just offering advice. She also noted that there’s no such thing as a “banned” color. I didn’t have to give up my favorite, yellow — but she suggested trying a more lemon-y shade instead of a buttery one. I also don’t have to throw out all my black clothes just yet. (Not that I have the money to go buy a whole new wardrobe anyway.) Seo suggested black accessories, and noted that black pants and skirts are also “approved” — basically, if it’s not next to my face, it’s fair game. After the session, Seo handed me a pre-printed card with my clear spring colors on it, so I could keep it in my wallet and use as a reference while shopping. Later, she sent me a long, detailed PDF full of suggestions about what to wear — and not only colors. Seo included suggestions about patterns (small ones), jewelry (colorful gems) and earring shapes (swirls over geometric lines), as well as recommended cuts for jackets and blouses, complete with photos of models and celebrities whose outfits worked as examples. A few weeks later, I bought a lemon-yellow dress that made me smile as soon as I saw myself in the dressing room mirror. Although I’m no longer sick, I’ll never be the same person I was before my cancer diagnosis. I’m on medicine that I’ll likely take for the rest of my life. I have mismatched breasts and visible scars. I’m in therapy to cope with the feelings that developed during my treatment. The word “remission” is still something I only say in whispers, a superstition. But maybe the next time I look in the mirror, I’ll recognize myself.",Style
Why a Dutch designer is knitting jumpers from human hair," A wooly coat and a head of human hair have more in common than you think; not only do they help retain body heat, they’re both made from keratin protein fibers. Now, a Dutch startup is questioning why one is worn and the other wasted. Human Material Loop hopes to transform the fashion industry by turning human hair into a textile. So far, it has made prototypes of human hair coats, jumpers, and blazers — with the hope that one day, clothing companies will buy rolls of its alternative material for their own designs. Co-founder Zsofia Kollar says she has long been fascinated by hair’s potential as a fabric﻿. She was intrigued by the emotions people harbor towards it —“How much we care about our hair, but once it’s cut, we are so disgusted by it,” she said. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Kollar had an identity crisis as a designer and decided to rectify the hair industry’s waste issue. Every minute, salons in the US and Canada produce 877 pounds of waste. When hair breaks down without the presence of oxygen, like in a garbage bag buried in a landfill, it releases greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. According to Human Material Loop, 72 million kilograms of human hair waste end up in European landfills every year, the equivalent in weight of seven Eiffel Towers. “It’s a big abundant waste stream that currently has no scalable solution,” Kollar said. She adds that most countries burn this waste, and that many alternative solutions are not environmentally friendly or aren’t suitable to be widely used. Kollar explains that using the hair fabric is not that different from knitting a sweater with any other material. Short hairs are spun together and transformed into a continuous thread to make a yarn, and then dyed with pure pigments. She added that as the company scales up production it may dye the yarn or fabric, depending on which is most efficient. Human Material Loop’s first prototype was a sweater with a wool-like feel. “I needed to make a product that people can relate to, and the jumper was one of the most feasible prototypes we could make, but also the most relatable,” Kollar said. Since then, the company has tested other prototypes, including an outdoor coat stuffed with hair to provide thermal insulation, which it tried out in harsh conditions during an expedition to Aconcagua, the highest mountain in Argentina. These designs aren’t available to buy — the aim is instead to supply the material for other designers and brands to work with. Kollar says the price should be competitive with wool once it reaches a bigger production volume. “We do know that to wear human hair on our bodies, it’s not something that most people are ready [for] yet,” Kollar said. But she believes the idea could grow on the public. For Kollar, it’s not simply about wearing a jumper made from human hair for the novelty or sustainability aspect; she argues that human hair is an incredibly durable material. Human Material Loop sources its hair from salons in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, using hair that is cut or broken off because it says that does not contain nuclear DNA that could identify an individual. It is working on establishing a documentation chain to trace where its material comes from and where it goes. Historically, human hair has been used as a textile in many different cultures. In Micronesia, the Kiribati tribe created woven armor made from natural materials including coconut fibers, shark teeth, palm leaves and human hair, while in the 13th century, people in what is now the Southwestern United States crafted socks by knotting together strands of hair. Kyoto’s Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is one of the world’s largest wooden structures. After a fire damaged it, ropes made from human hair donated from across Japan were mixed with hemp and used during its reconstruction in the 19th century. But using hair as a textile isn’t without challenges, explains Sanne Visser, a Dutch material researcher, designer and maker, and associate lecturer at the University of the Arts London, who isn’t involved with Human Material Loop. “There’s still a taboo around human hair as a material,” she said. “We don’t value it really as a resource — it’s seen as waste, especially once it’s cut off.” In her “Locally Grown” project for London’s Design Museum, Visser worked with hairdressers and imagined a future where hair becomes a valuable resource, coining the term “hair farming.” She also redesigned the barber’s chair so it could catch cut hair – saving time for the hairdresser, and the recycler. Visser says ultimately the implementation of human hair in our products isn’t simple. “There is much more work to do to get people’s heads around into accepting it as a material,” she said, but added, “I can definitely see it coming more into our daily lives, with time.”",Style
The Iranian artist using painting to honor her lost homeland," Soheila Sokhanvari’s retrospective “We Could Be Heroes…” takes its name from David Bowie’s 1977 classic “Heroes,” a song which has particular resonance for the Iranian born, UK-based artist. Like the two lovers separated by the Berlin Wall in Bowie’s song, Sokhanvari was separated from everything she knew and loved by the 1979 Revolution. The experience inspired her vibrantly patterned miniature paintings which evoke a hazily remembered pre-revolutionary past where progressive and conservative values co-existed — albeit uneasily — and resurrects icons the Islamic Republic sought to destroy. Sokhanvari, now 59, arrived in the UK in 1978 as a 14-year-old to stay with family friends, having never been away from loved ones before. The plan was for her to be educated in the UK before returning to Iran, but then the revolution began. “Overnight I lost access to everyone I loved, my language, my culture, everything,” said Sokhanvari from her home in Cambridge via Zoom. She found consolation in a family photo album her mother had packed for her and began drawing from the images. “When I was drawing the people in the photos came alive and I could relive that moment again. It helped me cope with the longing for my family and my people,” she recalled. For as long as she can remember Sokhanvari had wanted to be an artist, but she initially trained as a research scientist to please her mother. However it was a profession from which she always felt alienated. “I felt like I was trespassing in the world of science,” she said. A serious cycling accident in 1997 was the catalyst for Sokhanvari to finally follow her dream. “I promised myself that if I regained my health I would become an artist. I didn’t want any regrets in my life,” she explained. In Sokhanvari’s early work, she used Iranian crude oil — the discovery of which in 1908 would lead to international intrigue, coups and violence — to create sepia-tinged drawings of family holidays and popular culture in pre-revolutionary Iran. The seemingly nostalgic pictures suggest that through our use of oil “we are all implicated in these histories. There isn’t a person on this planet who hasn’t used crude oil in some way. It’s in our clothes, in plastic, in paints,” said Sokhanvari. The images encourage us to acknowledge that the politics around its production and supply “comes with environmental, economic, and human cost,” she said. But it is her later miniatures for which she has become best known. Painted in egg tempera (pigment mixed with egg yolk) on a parchment made from calf vellum (calf skin) using a squirrel hair brush — a technique traditionally associated with Persian miniatures — each small painting takes Sokhanvari between six and 12 weeks to create, working a minimum of 12-hours a day. Her first major solo show, “Rebel Rebel”, which focused on her series of female performers silenced by the revolution, was warmly received by critics when it opened at the Barbican in London in 2022. Jackie Wullschläger in The Financial Times praised her “defiantly joyful art” while Jonathan Jones in The Guardian called it “ the opposite of instant art.” Sokhanvari’s initial inspiration for her miniatures was the family photographs which had consoled her throughout her childhood. “My father and mother were my muses, they were these characters that I built up a story around,” she said. Pre-revolution her father worked as a fashion designer and model and encouraged Sokhanvari’s beehive-wearing mother to embrace western fashions. However her grandmother was far more traditional. “In the same family you can have this chasm between people who embraced western ideologies and those who rejected them,” she recalled. The conflicted ideologies are addressed via the combination of western and Islamic patterns in her work. “I put the two together because these people are trying to negotiate the two opposing cultures,” she said. In “Conquest of the Garden” (2016) her mother can be seen sitting on a chintzy chair in a walled garden decorated in bold Islamic tiles. Fists rise up from the flowerbeds. It was in 2019 that Sokhavani began to focus on Iranian female performers such as  actress Kobra Saeedi, who could no longer work following the 1979 revolution. Banned from performing, singing or dancing in public, many other artists were also imprisoned and allegedly tortured. Any films they had appeared in were burned and their images destroyed as the new regime attempted to erase any evidence that they had ever existed. For Sokhanvari, who was only able to embrace her true vocation as an artist later in life, the desire to create their portraits was deeply personal. “I just thought of how I would feel if I were stopped from creating my art,” she said. Using online images, Sokhanvari resurrects these women in their prime, creating modern day martyr portraits of a generation of women whose lives were destroyed. Some are caught in dramatic poses, others recline comfortably on a sofa, but all are enveloped in a riot of pattern and color, as they call out across the decades to be remembered. Thanks to the UK-based Persian language TV channel Manoto — who interviewed Sokhanvari when “Rebel Rebel” was on — many Iranians now know that they have been. Although Sokhanvari doesn’t want to name names for fear of endangering them, she says that a number of her subjects contacted her via Instagram having seen the program via satellite in Iran. The portraits could never be shown in Iran (the only work Sokhnavari has ever shown there are drawings she mailed to an artist friend in 2015) but at least the women knew they existed. “They said that it felt like a Renaissance for them,” she said. “They were so grateful to have been given a platform.” The Emmy Award-winning actor Shohreh Aghdashloo, one of Sokhanvari’s subjects who was actually able to continue her career having left Iran after the revolution, flew from Los Angeles to the UK to visit the show. “All of these women were her friends. She was so happy that their stories were being told,” said Sokhanvari. She is also cautiously optimistic about the future of her country, thanks to both an increasingly secular younger generation and more men standing shoulder-to-shoulder with women. “If everybody rises up then we will win and the next generation will make a better Iran,” Sokhanvari said. “You have to have hope, right?” Sheila Sokhanvari “We Could Be Heroes” is on at the Heong Gallery, Cambridge, UK, until 4 February 2024.",Style
These portraits show young people who are proud to be Native — even if others don’t see them that way," The people of Pembroke, North Carolina, don’t shy away from their Native identity. In fact, some of them wear it on their sleeves — be it a feather-patterned blanket draped around the shoulders or a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Native Pride.” These kinds of markers are everywhere in Pembroke, the tribal seat of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, and surrounding Robeson County, photographer Maria Sturm said. But when members of this 55,000-strong tribe venture outside their tight-knit community, they’re often told they don’t “look” Native. That tension is at the heart of Sturm’s latest photography book “You Don’t Look Native To Me,” recently published by VOID. Through tender portraits of young Lumbee people, combined with snippets of interview transcripts and historical text, Sturm explores what makes someone Native American. Is it race, tribal citizenship or a community you’re a part of? Who gets to decide? And what do you do when outsiders — the US government and even other tribes — don’t see you the way you see yourselves? “It is more the way you carry yourself, and it doesn’t really matter the shade that you have,” Sturm said in a Zoom interview. “The shade that you have matters in an outside world more than it mattered in that microcosm of Robeson County.” Questions of identity and belonging loom large for the Lumbee, the most populous tribe east of the Mississippi River. Though the state of North Carolina recognized the tribe in 1885 and Congress in 1956 acknowledged the Lumbee as American Indians, the federal government also denied them the rights and funding afforded to other federally recognized tribes. To this day, the Lumbee tribe continues to fight for full federal recognition. The tribe’s in-between status is a product of its history. The Lumbee have roots in various Sioux, Algonquin and Iroquois-speaking nations who migrated to modern-day Robeson County after fleeing disease, the slave trade and warfare brought on by European colonization, as historian Malinda Maynor Lowery documents in “The Lumbee Indians: An American Struggle.” Some of the Natives eventually intermarried with English-speaking settlers, as well as enslaved and free African Americans, resulting in a mixed population with a wide array of physical features. Descendants of these groups make up the community now known as the Lumbee. Even as their culture and traditions evolved over time, and as others question their status as American Indians, the Lumbee maintained an identity as Native people. And as Sturm captures in her photos, many young Lumbee are figuring out for themselves what that identity and culture looks like. Sturm, who is Romanian and grew up in Germany, started photographing the Lumbee in 2011. The project was born out of a conversation with her stepfather, who told her about his friend Jay Hansford C. Vest — a member of the Monacan Indian Nation, which at the time was unrecognized by the federal government. Sturm kept stumbling over the word “unrecognized.” She couldn’t wrap her head around the concept: How could a non-Native entity determine whether a tribe was Native American or not? What did that even mean? Sturm said her stepfather also mentioned that Vest had blue eyes and blond hair — a detail that prompted her to confront her own internalized notions and stereotypes about Native Americans. “In that moment, I thought, ‘Wait a minute. I have never met a Native American person in my life. Why can he not be blond and have blue eyes?’” she said. Sturm visited Vest at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, where he was teaching at the time, and sat in on his classes. Thinking she would explore the issue of unrecognized tribes, she asked Vest’s students if anyone might be able to take her around their community. That’s when she encountered Jonathan Jacobs, a Lumbee man whose musings about Lumbee culture and identity are featured prominently through the book. Through Jacobs, Sturm said she was introduced to other Lumbee and the project grew from there. Over the course of several visits between 2011 and 2017, Sturm documented the lives of the Lumbee, gravitating toward how young people understood their identity and how they chose to telegraph that to the world. “With the rise of social media, there was a new way of being proud of identifying yourself as Native American whereas before it wasn’t always possible,” Sturm said. As Sturm observed, that identity is signaled, in part, through the heavily present Native symbolism. Pembroke “screams of Native American things,” she added. It’s in the roads named “Lumbee Street” and “Dreamcatcher Drive,” in the dreamcatchers hanging on the walls of homes, on cars and in tattoos. In these symbols, Sturm picked up on an implicit message. “For me, it’s a little bit like, ‘Don’t ask me. Maybe I don’t look that way, but it’s clear. We don’t have to have this discussion,’” Sturm said. Some might even perceive it as stereotypical — in one photo, a Lumbee man named Scottie wears a Washington Redskins jacket containing a logo that is now widely considered offensive. When Sturm asked him about it, she said he told her “this is who I am.” “It shows that you know you are something. And because everything is stripped away … you have just these little bits and pieces that you can hold onto,” Sturm said. “I thought it’s pretty impressive that the symbols that a person like Scottie holds onto are not even original, but in a way they give him so much pride and confidence.” Throughout the book, Sturm’s subjects reflect on their personal struggles around their identity. Kayla tells Strum about how her grandmother raised her as Lumbee, but at the same time didn’t take her to powwows and discouraged her from speaking the Lumbee dialect. As a result, she was picked on for “talking like a White girl” at home, yet is considered a “country bumpkin” when she goes elsewhere. Jacobs, meanwhile, pushes back on the idea that the Lumbee even need federal recognition. Even though certain aspects of their culture have been lost or changed over time, he knows he is Lumbee, as do others in the community. For him, it’s all that matters. “I’m like a billion percent sure we will never know what Lumbee language was. I’m a billion percent sure we will never know really where we came from. But that does not mean we are not Indian,” Jacobs says in the book. It’s this sense of self-determination that has stuck with Sturm. She hopes the project will resonate with anyone who has ever had their identity questioned. “I hope at least that many people can relate to this feeling of wanting or belonging to something, but other people are not able to see that about you,” Sturm said.",Style
Capturing the wild days of early-2000s indie rock," If you were a teen at the turn of the millennium, chances are your musical taste fell into one of two camps: You were either a pop kid, with the likes of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, *NSYNC or Destiny’s Child on your Sony Discman, or you were a “new indie rock” kid with posters of Pete Doherty or The Strokes’ Julian Casablancas on your bedroom walls. The latter genre was loosely defined. Indie rock acts ranged in style and sound. The Libertines, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Modest Mouse and Amy Winehouse might all be considered part of the movement, albeit in very different ways. What they shared, though, was an aura of cool — one that Los Angeles-based photographer Piper Ferguson spent much of her early career capturing. Ferguson’s debut book “Indie, Seen” offers a raw and nostalgic look at the early-2000s, with behind-the-scenes portraits depicting artists from Interpol to Kasabian, Peaches to PJ Harvey. Together they form what she described as “a collection of ‘moments’ that really capture what indie was all about back then.” “I have so much footage from those days,” she said over Zoom. “To me, it was such a fantastic, creative era for the music industry.” Comprising some 350 images, many of which spent years languishing in filing cabinets, “Indie, Seen” features live shots and party pictures, candid snapshots and editorial portraits, all shot using film. Many were taken at Ferguson’s own LA club Cafe Bleu, which she opened with best friend Shalyce Benfell in the late 1990s, while later pictures were captured as she traveled the world to photograph festivals for magazines. “I have always been into music — so much so that I originally wanted to direct music videos. Photography didn’t really seem like a career option. Then I bought a small Pentax (camera) and began shooting all the bands that played at Cafe Bleu,” Ferguson said, explaining that she learned her craft from photography books purchased at a yard sale. “I started taking the camera with me everywhere I went, just snapping gigs, the crowds, the backstage. And I fell in love with it.” In 1999, Ferguson had a picture — a close-up shot of Rage Against the Machine performing at the very first edition of Coachella — published in a major music publication, Spin, for the first time. More magazine work, from features to covers, followed. Over the next decade, she established herself as a respected name in the indie circuit and, at the time, one of its very few female photographers. “It was obviously a bit different being a woman in a very male-dominated field,” Ferguson said. “But overall, there were way more people who were supportive than weren’t. I think that’s one of the things that made the indie movement particularly great: There was a collective sense of wanting to do something really cool and help others doing the same. I was treated like a peer, an equal. Everybody was just striving to make something good.” This camaraderie is evident throughout “Indie, Seen,” which sees Ferguson weave together photos with personal, first-hand accounts and vignettes of her experience shooting them. There’s Joe Strummer of The Clash telling her “You can’t rush art, baby” as she apologizes for a shoot taking too long (“one of the greatest moments of my career,” Ferguson said of the playful comment); The Verve front man Richard Ashcroft driving her through a London park in search of the perfect backdrop for a picture; and The Smiths’ guitarist Johnny Marr (who wrote the foreword to her book) becoming a good friend of hers after working on several shoots together. “Mostly, everyone was just really laidback and fun,” Ferguson said. “And a bit wild, of course.” Sections of the book are dedicated to episodes that felt like particularly meaningful cultural moments — The Strokes playing at West Hollywood’s Troubadour in 2001, the year the band’s debut album “Is This It” sealed indie rock as the next chapter of rock ‘n’ roll; or Coldplay performing at LA’s Chateau Marmont in 2002 shortly after the release of “A Rush of Blood to the Head.” “I realized I was witnessing history and tried to take in each and every shoot,” she said. Ferguson also delves into quieter moments with seminal bands like The Killers, Pavement, Interpol and The Libertines. While she said all the shoots felt special, her favorites include a raw on-stage image of the late Amy Winehouse putting on a ballet slipper while balancing on the other foot. “She looked so nervous and was shaking, as if she had no idea why the crowd was going crazy for her,” Ferguson recalled, adding that the late singer looked “so vulnerable.” Then there’s the photo of Beck in a bright green jumper and floral tie, umbrella in hand, looking directly down Ferguson’s lens outside a taco joint in Hollywood. The image, from a Mojo magazine shoot marking the release of his 2005 album “Guero,” graces the cover of Ferguson’s book. “He’s the coolest, most down-to-earth creative kid in town,” she said, “and the epitome of indie rock.” As well as capturing era-defining bands, “Indie, Seen” spotlights some of the 2000s’ lesser-known — but nonetheless influential — bands like The Datsuns, Foxygen and The Bangs. For Ferguson, illustrating the breadth of the movement was key to curating the book. “When I think of indie music from the early aughts, I think of something inherently different, artistic and creative,” she said. “So many bands were part of that, and I thought it was important to show them all. The scene was so wide-ranging.” This might be one of the reasons why the genre thrived in the 2000s, despite being considered “alternative.” Eschewing strict categorizations, indie rock ranged from the catchy and high-energy tunes of The Cribs to the deeply intimate and introspective songs of Cat Power, from Death Cab for Cutie’s atmospheric albums to the folksy vibes of Iron & Wine, all artists Ferguson had the opportunity to photograph. Indie music had what Ferguson called an “almost DIY approach” that, she noted, made it feel authentic and open to experimentation. The genre became the decade’s soundtrack for a generation of millennials – and some Gen X-ers, too. Still, Ferguson hopes the appeal of “Indie, Seen” extends beyond those who grew up in the 2000s. “I’d love for younger generations to pick up the book and go, ‘Let me go find this or that band on Spotify,’” she said. “Indie rock marks a pretty influential period of our music history, so I’d really like for it to continue to reverberate. I want ‘Indie, Seen’ to be a celebration. An invitation to be inspired by those cool kids from back then. Try things. Don’t be afraid. Get out there. That’s the indie spirit.” “Indie, Seen,” published by Insight Editions, is available now.",Style
Is this Banksy’s real name? Resurfaced interview suggests it could be," Anonymity lies at the center of the mythology surrounding the elusive street artist Banksy, but he may have revealed his name in a resurfaced interview. First recorded in 2003, the interview was released Tuesday as a bonus episode of the BBC podcast series “The Banksy Story.” When former BBC arts correspondent Nigel Wrench asked Banksy whether his name was “Robert Banks,” as The Independent newspaper had reported at the time, the artist responded: “It’s Robbie.” Wrench shared the archival interview with podcast host James Peak, a self-confessed “super fan” of Banksy’s work, after hearing the 10-episode series that had charted the artist’s rise and included an unverified recording of his voice from a recovered 2005 interview with US National Public Radio (NPR). However, all might not be as it seems, as is so often the case with Banksy – an artist known for his satirical humor, subversive methods and anti-authority themes. “A name comes out,” Peak told CNN Tuesday. “Is it the right name? Is it a clever joke?” Peak added, alluding to the fact that a name like Robbie Banks could be a good pun. Shielded by his anonymity, Banksy’s distinctive graffiti art has popped up around the world, appearing on the walls of bombed buildings in Ukraine, on T-shirts to support protesters facing trial for toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston during 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in England, and in Paris, highlighting Europe’s migrant crisis in 2018. His 2003 show, which opened shortly after his interview with Wrench, featured graffitied police vans, an image of Winston Churchill with a grass Mohican and live farm animals painted with the Metropolitan Police’s blue-checked patterns. Banksy talks about these political themes within his work with Wrench, revealing the “kernel” of his early ideas before he became a global icon, as he considered the merits of using graffiti as a means to produce art, Peak said. “If you are a guy making art that sells for ridiculous sums of money and you have this… administration around you, I have often wondered how pure you can be in your intention and art,” Peak added. “And what strikes me listening to this interview is all that is present and correct… it’s almost like he’s made up his mind about… what his art is for and the means of engagement for it.” Despite these political themes that have marked his work from early on, Banksy told Wrench in 2003 that he didn’t consider himself to be “that political.” He added: “If you think about anything about your life for longer than a second, then you have to work out that the shoes you wear are made by somebody on a pathetic amount of money and the coffee you drink means somebody, somewhere in the world is getting done over.” Speaking about vandalism and his approach to art, Banksy said: “[Vandalism] is a quicker way of making your point.” “For me, the golden aim really is… it takes you less time to make it than it takes for people to look at it,” he added. Asked whether his exhibition was about anarchism, Banksy told Wrench: “I’m interested in injustice. Who has the right to judge anybody else? If you’ve ever fallen foul of the justice system then it turns you very skeptical about everything, so I guess I like to turn it on its head a little bit… I’m into working out who really is the good guys.” Listening to the archival interview has only increased his admiration of Banksy, Peak said, an admiration that grew from realizing the artistic “brilliance” but also the “warm and human and kind and progressive and liberal… sentiments” underpinning it.",Style
‘The Hesitant Fiancée’s’ 19th-century eye roll is connecting with fed-up women on TikTok," Behold, a woman fuming. Though she’s dressed in an opulent, fur-trimmed gown in a palatial French home sometime in the mid-19th century, her silent fury is recognizable to women the world over who’ve contained their ire to an eye roll. She’s “The Hesitant Fiancée,” the eponymous subject of the painter Auguste Toulmouche’s 1866 painting. The realist work, which had been overshadowed in art history by the arrival of French Impressionist painters soon after, is being reappraised more than 150 years later by art buffs on TikTok. She’s inspired scores of interpretations from users who imagine the undoubtedly irritated thoughts going through her mind when she was painted — “you’d look so much prettier with a smile on your face” — becoming something of a meme template. She’s appreciated by women who share her disillusionment with confining gender roles. And she’s inviting feminist reassessments of the painting itself. When “The Hesitant Fiancée” was first exhibited, works depicting the quiet indignation of women were sometimes seen as unserious, and much of the popular art at the time satirized single women, said Kathryn Brown, associate professor of art history and visual culture at Loughborough University in the UK. But seen through contemporary eyes, “The Hesitant Fiancée” shows women in solidarity, supporting each other in “negotiating oppressive systems,” noted Brown, who wrote about Toulmouche’s work in the monograph “Women Readers in French Painting 1870–1890.” “Over a century and a half later, perhaps we’re still discovering the full political significance of that kind of unity,” she said in an email. Toulmouche painted scenes of elegant, wealthy French women in domestic settings, often chronicling their romantic exploits. The women in his paintings were, on the surface, little more than sumptuously dressed debutantes — the French novelist Émile Zola in 1874 called Toulmouche’s subjects “delicious dolls,” Brown said. Toulmouche’s paintings were successful in their day partly because of the “fantasy of female life” they depicted: The women in his works are wives, mothers, sisters and daughters who don’t stray from their roles in the domestic sphere, Brown said. “The Hesitant Fiancée,” also translated to “The Reluctant Bride,” was originally exhibited under the title “Un mariage de raison,” or “A Marriage of Convenience” at the Académie des Beaux-Arts’ Paris Salon in 1866, Brown said. Toulmouche’s work was popular for a time, with his paintings often recreated as etchings in newspapers, Brown noted. But he was eventually overshadowed by Impressionist painters like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas, she said. While Toulmouche was “by no means a painter of feminist art,” Brown said, the women in his paintings are interpreted today as slyly subversive. In the 1865 painting “Forbidden Fruit,” three young women excitedly pore over books in a library while a fourth appears to guard the door. They’ve snuck into this room searching for information — “undoubtedly about sex,” Brown added, based on their wry smiles — that’s been kept from them. Brown suggests that the four women in “Forbidden Fruit” reappear in “The Hesitant Fiancée,” now supporting one of their own in her unhappy slog toward the altar. “One of the four young women from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ is now about to be married, perhaps to the ‘wrong’ person or because she doesn’t want to marry at all,” Brown said. “Read as a narrative that unfolds across the two works, it looks like the young woman from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ knows what’s about to happen to her.” The revival of “The Hesitant Fiancée” has been centuries in the making. Popular art accounts on TikTok started posting about it over the last few weeks, discovering it with glee, though at least one user, art enthusiast Kira (@TheArtRevival), shared a video about Toulmouche in February. She said in an email that she’s long loved his work. “One of my favorite subjects in art is fancy ladies lounging around, living life with apathy,” she said. “Few can relate to their lives but nearly all can relate to their disdain.” The popular user Tatyana About Art said that “The Hesitant Fiancée” is really a tragedy. The subject of the painting is likely depicted moments away from — or moments after — marrying the husband she’s less than in love with. She’s flanked by two women who gently attempt to comfort her while another plays with a flower crown in the mirror, perhaps dreaming of her own wedding day. “The bride is completely alone in her sentiment of doom and unwillingness,” art historian Tatyana said in a video about “The Hesitant Fiancée.” Today, though, some TikTok-ers view the titular fiancée as a rebel, not entering quietly into a marriage she’s unhappy about. Some users have theorized that she may not have been attracted to men at all, and since homosexuality was still viewed as immoral in 19th-century France, living openly would’ve been near-impossible at the time. While we may never know the full story of the woman skulking in the armchair, her fed-up mien is familiar to anyone who’s ever had to swallow their anger. She’s trapped, said Kira, and “we’ve all been there.” That she’s expressing it within the confines of her rigid societal role is still captivating over a century later. “I see her and think, ‘Yes babe, roll those eyes,’” Kira said.",Style
Russian artist receives seven-year sentence for anti-war protest," Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko, who had replaced price tags with anti-war messages in a St. Petersburg grocery store as an act of protest, was sentenced to seven years in jail by a court in the Russian city on Thursday. According to the court’s press service, Skochilenko was found guilty of “public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” The prosecution claimed that in March last year, Skochilenko “placed paper fragments containing deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in places for attaching commodity price tags” in a chain supermarket in St. Petersburg. Despite Skochilenko pleading not guilty to the charge and the defense seeking acquittal, the court imposed a seven-year sentence with a three-year ban on activities related to using “electronic or information and telecommunication networks,” the press service said in a Telegram post. Skochilenko has been kept in pretrial detention since April 2022, a period of time in which her health has been deteriorating, according to the independent investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta. In her last statement in court prior to the announcement of the verdict on Thursday, Skochilenko questioned the perceived threat posed by her actions, stating, “How little faith does our prosecutor have in our state and society if he believes that our statehood and public safety can be destroyed by five small pieces of paper?” Describing herself as a pacifist, Skochilenko said she did not understand the purpose of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. “Today, scientists and doctors around the world are fighting to increase human life expectancy and find cures for deadly diseases. Therefore, I don’t understand: what is (this) war for? War shortens lives. War is death,” she added, according to a courtroom correspondent for the independent news outlet Mediazona. Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director, Marie Struthers, condemned the conviction. In a statement, Struthers decried the “manifestly unjust verdict,” highlighting that Skochilenko had been “arbitrarily deprived of her freedom and held in torturous conditions for 19 months.” Skochilenko “was simply trying to expose … Russian aggression against the people of Ukraine,” Struthers continued. “Her persecution has become synonymous with the absurdly cruel oppression faced by Russians openly opposing their country’s criminal war.”",Style
Long-lost $26 million masterpiece found in kitchen heads to the Louvre after 4-year campaign," The Louvre Museum in Paris has added a “national treasure” to its collection four years after it was discovered during a house clearance. “Christ Mocked” by the Florentine painter Cimabue was found in an elderly woman’s house in the town of Compiegne in 2019. She had kept the rare artwork – which she thought was a Greek religious icon – in her kitchen. The unsuspecting owner of the piece did not know where the 10-inch by 8-inch painting had come from, said Jerome Montcouquil of art specialists Cabinet Turquin, which was asked to carry out tests on the painting following its discovery, at the time. The painting, which dates from 1280, went on to fetch almost 24.2 million euros ($26.8 million) at auction in October 2019, more than four times the pre-sale estimate. But the French government then stepped in to block its export, assigning the painting “national treasure” status. The move kept the tiny, ultra-rare painting in the country for 30 months, during which time the government raised the funds to buy it for the nation. Now, France’s minister of culture, Rima Abdul Malak, and the president and director of the Louvre Museum, Laurence des Cars, have announced that the painting forms part of the museum’s collection. “These acquisitions are the result of an exceptional mobilization of the Louvre Museum which allows to preserve in France works coveted by the greatest museums of the world and to make them accessible to all,” said the ministry in a statement, without providing any further details on how the money was raised. The ministry went on to call the painting “a crucial milestone in art history, marking the fascinating transition from icon to painting.” Only around 15 of Cimabue’s works are known, which is why the painting “is a national treasure of major importance,” adds the ministry. It will join the much larger Cimabue painting “Maestà” in the Louvre collection, and both works will be part of an exhibition event in spring 2025, according to the ministry. Cimabue is the pseudonym of artist Cenni di Pepo, born in Florence around the year 1240. He is known to have been the discoverer and master of Giotto, widely regarded as one of the greatest artists of the pre-Renaissance era. “Christ Mocked” is part of a diptych comprising eight scenes centered on the passion and crucifixion of Christ. The National Gallery in London is home to another scene from the work, “The Virgin and Child with Two Angels,” which the gallery acquired in 2000. It had been lost for centuries, before a British aristocrat found it in his ancestral home in Suffolk, according to AFP. Another, “The Flagellation of Christ,” can be found at the Frick Collection in New York.",Style
The former host of ‘Reading Rainbow’ used to encourage kids to read books. Now he’s telling adults not to ban them," As the National Book Awards came to a close on Wednesday, finalists for the prestigious literary prizes took the stage in New York to speak about the Israel-Hamas war, with others at the ceremony also choosing to address banned books. Aaliyah Bilal, who was nominated for the fiction award for her short story collection “Temple Folk,” read from a prepared statement as a group of fellow finalists stood around her. “On behalf of the finalists, we oppose the ongoing bombardment of Gaza and call for an humanitarian ceasefire to address the urgent humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians, particularly children,” Bilal said at the ceremony. “We oppose antisemitism and anti-Palestinian sentiment and Islamophobia equally, accepting the human dignity of all parties, knowing that further bloodshed does nothing to secure lasting peace in the region.” Some audience members in the room responded with a standing ovation. But the authors’ coordinated statement also underscored tensions within the literary community — upon learning that a group of awards finalists planned to make a statement about the war, two sponsors decided not to attend the ceremony, The New York Times reported. Zibby Owens, owner of Zibby Media, wrote in a Substack essay ahead of the ceremony that her company decided to withdraw its support and attendance after she learned the authors planned to “collectively band together to use their speeches to promote a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israeli agenda.” She added that she felt the event would promote discrimination against Israel and the Jewish people. The subscription service Book of the Month, which remained a sponsor, told CNN in a statement that it did not attend the ceremony, but continued to support the event. It’s not unusual for political statements to feature at the National Book Awards, as the National Book Foundation noted in its own statement ahead of the event. Aside from the finalists’ comments about the Israel-Hamas war, several speakers and authors used their platforms at the awards ceremony to address efforts to ban books in US schools and libraries. LeVar Burton, a children’s author and former host of the iconic TV program “Reading Rainbow,” emceed the awards ceremony and opened with a joke. “Before we get going, are there any Moms for Liberty in the house?” he asked, referring to a conservative group behind recent attempts to remove certain books from school shelves. “No? Good. Then hands will not need to be thrown tonight.” In his opening speech, Burton alluded to the climate in which book banning attempts are taking place. “It was my mother who taught me at a very young age that if you can read in at least one language, you are, by her definition, free. And that idea of freedom feels especially fraught in this global political moment,” he said. “There are wars and rumors of wars and the machineries of war at work. On the home front, we are fighting for control of truth and how we interpret truth in this country. Books are being banned, words are being silenced and writers and others who champion books are under attack. “ Oprah Winfrey, who was celebrated as the ceremony’s special guest, drew attention to people who have been targeted for pushing back against book banning attempts. She quoted Barbara Kingsolver and Tess Gunty, and name-checked Abraham Verghese and Amanda Gorman, among other authors. She also spoke about the importance of reading books by diverse authors, sharing how Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” had a profound impact on her as a 15-year-old. “That book gave a voice to my silences, my secrets. It gave words to my pain and my confusion of being raped at 9 years old,” she said. “Until ‘Caged Bird’ I didn’t know that there was a language, there were words, for what had happened to me or that any other human being on earth had experienced it. That’s the power of books.” At the end of her speech, Oprah said she hoped children would be able to see themselves in the pages of books, and consequently, be able to see others more clearly, too. “Make no mistake: To ban books is to snuff out the flames of truth, of what it means to be alive, what it means to be aware, what it means to be engaged in the world. To ban books is to cut us off from one another, to shroud us in a solitary darkness, a soulless echo chamber,” she said. “To ban books is to strangle off what sustains us and makes us better people.” Wednesday’s National Book Awards winners reflected a diverse array of subjects. Justin Torres won the fiction award for “Blackouts,” an experimental novel that blends queer history and fiction to depict a deathbed conversation between two gay men. Ned Blackhawk received the nonfiction honor for “The Rediscovery of America: Native Peoples and the Unmaking of U.S. History,” a retelling of America’s story that places Indigenous people at its center. Craig Santos Perez won the poetry prize for his collection “from unincorporated territory [åmot],” about his native Guam and the culture of the Chamorro people. Dan Santat nabbed the young people’s literature award for his middle-grade graphic memoir, “A First Time For Everything,” and Stênio Gardel won for literature in translation for “The Words That Remain,” translated from Portuguese by Bruna Dantas Lobato.",Style
A Texas museum acquired this masterpiece for $26M. But the Louvre wants to keep it in France," When the Kimbell Art Museum secured Jean Siméon Chardin’s “The Basket of Wild Strawberries” at auction for almost 24.4 million euros ($26.4 million) last March, the Texas institution expected the painting to join its small but valuable collection of European masterpieces. But a month later, France’s culture ministry denied the 18th-century artwork an export license and designated it a “national treasure” — status that gave the country’s national collections two and a half years to purchase it by matching the winning bid. Now, with less than four months left and 1.3 million euros ($1.4 million) still to raise, the Louvre Museum is turning to the public to keep the oil painting in France. The Paris institution last week launched a fundraising campaign to help acquire a work it describes as “the quintessence of Chardin’s oeuvre.” Having already raised a significant portion of the money — including 15 million euros ($16.3 million) pledged by LVMH, owner of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. — the Louvre is calling for public donations before the export ban expires in February. At the time of publication, the campaign had raised 20% of the required sum from over 2,000 donors. Potential patrons are being offered various perks in return, including private tours to view the painting and invites to a museum cocktail reception. Chardin is widely heralded as being one of the greatest ever still life artists. Produced around 1760, the painting centers on a pyramid of strawberries in a wicker basket. It is one of several celebrated works by the French painter that depict fruits including plums and peaches. The 18-inch-wide work was put on sale by a descendant of the 19th-century art collector Eudoxe Marcille, according to auction house ArtCurial, which handled the 2022 sale. Initially expected to attract bids up to 15 million euros ($16.2 million), the painting was eventually won by the Kimbell Art Museum, which was founded in Fort Worth, Texas in 1972. The institution’s collection of over 300 artworks currently includes Michelangelo’s first known painting, “The Torment of Saint Anthony” and paintings by several major French artists, including Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin. The Texas museum already has one other Chardin work in its collection. The Louvre, meanwhile, has more than 40, though the Paris institution described “The Basket of Wild Strawberries” as being “the last (painting) of its quality to remain in private hands.” “Its entry into the national collections would masterfully complete the unique ensemble already presented at the Louvre Museum, the most important by this painter in the world,” said Louvre director Laurence des Cars in press release, describing the painting as “imbued with the poetry of senses.” In a statement emailed to CNN, the Kimbell Art Museum’s director Eric M. Lee appeared to accept that his institution would never be able to complete the purchase. “While I’m sorry that the painting will not find its home at the Kimbell, I’m delighted that this masterpiece of French painting will be on view for the public at the Louvre,” he said. Lee was unavailable for further comment. But he earlier told the New York Times: “I agree that the painting is a national treasure of France. But I also believe that it is a world treasure and could serve as an ambassador of French culture.”",Style
‘Lost its soul’: Campaigners decry renovation of Thailand’s iconic ‘Robot Building’," For almost four decades, its cartoonish eyes gazed out placidly over Sathorn, a commercial district in downtown Bangkok. Now, with its facade stripped back to a concrete frame amid major renovations, the tower affectionately known as the “Robot Building” is barely recognizable, save for its characteristically blocky silhouette. The building’s owners, the Thai arm of Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB), say the refurbishment will make its headquarters more energy-efficient and employee-friendly. While the company would not share images of the proposed redesign with CNN, conservationists and architects — including the tower’s 84-year-old designer, who says he was shown plans for the new exterior — have expressed dismay at dramatic alterations being made to an icon of Southeast Asian postmodernism. Completed in 1986, the Robot Building was intended to reflect changes in the banking industry, which at the time was embracing new computer technology. Its designer Sumet Jumsai, who was inspired by one of his son’s toy robots, is considered a major figure in contemporary Thai architecture, and was named a “national artist” by the country’s government. In an email to CNN, Sumet, who is now retired, decried the “defacement” of his creation. He described renovations as a “devastating statement” demonstrating the “ignorance and arrogance (of) big corporations.” In March, the architect wrote to UOB Thailand expressing concern over the loss of the tower’s “original iconic features,” including its eyes, and urging it to reconsider plans “before it is too late.” The bank’s response, which was shared with CNN by Sumet, acknowledged that the building was a “significant landmark” — but said the planned refurbishment would bring it “into a new era while paying homage to its heritage.” The bank added that it will keep a replica of the building’s original form in “a corner of the lobby.” Originally designed for the Bank of Asia, the tower was acquired by UOB Thailand in 2005. The firm told CNN, via email, that its renovations are focused on “promoting environmental sustainability” and “enhancing employee well-being” for the thousands of workers who will occupy the building upon its reopening in 2025. The organization said its redesign will reduce electricity consumption by at least 15%, with a new glass exterior “minimizing the need for artificial lighting and thus reducing associated… carbon emissions.” Standing 20 stories high, the Robot Building’s floors get progressively smaller as they rise, giving the structure its distinctive staggered shape. Its iconic lidded “eyes” served as windows for two executive suites on the upper floors, while the building’s toy-like appearance was completed by antennas — used for communications and as lightning rods — and a series of large metallic nuts decorating its sides. The Robot Building is among a vanishingly small number of landmarks from the era to have survived Bangkok’s breakneck urban development. After recovering from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Thailand’s capital experienced a building boom that transformed areas like Sathorn. Bangkok is now the world’s 14th tallest city, with 112 towers measuring 150 meters (492 feet) or above, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). The Thai branch of Docomomo International, a non-profit dedicated to preserving modern architecture, said it has identified the relatively diminutive Robot Building in its upcoming list of the country’s 20 “most outstanding” structures. In an open letter to UOB Thailand, published in April, the conservation group’s president, Pongkwan Lassus, described the Robot Building as an “historical marker” signaling the transition from late modernism to postmodernism — an architectural movement known for decorative facades, ornamentation and a rejection of the mid-century mantra “form follows function.” Bangkok-based filmmaker Dana Blouin, who is producing an as-yet-unnamed documentary on the Robot Building, said that despite campaigners’ pleas, the tower has now “lost its soul.” “We’ve lost something that was probably more important than anyone realized,” he told CNN via video call. While recognizing the tower may have been viewed as a “novelty,” Blouin said the original design “felt elevated and refined.” He added: “It was still fun, and it was still whimsical. And it was beautiful.” “When it was built, it was one of the tallest buildings (in Sathorn district),” he said. “Today, the structure is minuscule by comparison — it’s dwarfed by these other glass and steel structures all around it. And that made it all the more special.” The filmmaker’s affection may not be shared by many in Bangkok. A petition, started in April by campaign groups including Docomomo, had attracted fewer than 1,700 signatures at the time of writing. Thailand’s conservation efforts and laws, meanwhile, are mostly directed towards the country’s ancient heritage. Campaigners and architects hope that, while it may be too late for the Robot Building, other important examples of contemporary architecture may be spared a similar fate. “After nearly two decades of effort, we are beginning to see a shift from the government sector,” reads Pongkwan’s letter to UOB Thailand. For Blouin, a wider cultural shift is needed if other modern Bangkok landmarks are to be preserved. “The embrace of newness… has led to the forgetting of some of these icons,” he said. “And that’s unfortunate.”",Style
This massive ‘floating’ museum is straight out of science fiction," The seven-point metallic star floats on the glassy surface of the lake, reminiscent of a far-flung future civilization, or a spaceship touching down on an alien planet. It looks like something straight out of science fiction. Which it is, in a way: it’s the brand new Chengdu Science Fiction Museum in the capital of Sichuan province in Southwest China. From one side, the dynamic roof mimics the sloping mountains in the distance; from another, the canopy takes on the appearance of a cloud, its cantilever arches suspended above seamless panes of glass. “From every angle, it will always look different; it will always look unusual or unexpected,” said Paulo Flores, one of the project directors at Zaha Hadid Architects, which designed the museum. Perhaps more unexpected than the design itself is the time it took to build. The museum was commissioned in 2022 to host this year’s 81st annual World Science Fiction Convention, nicknamed Worldcon. A building of this size and complexity would typically take four to five years to build, says Flores. But the 59,000 square-meter building — which is three times the size of the Sydney Opera House — went from concept to completion in just 12 months. But despite the tight turnaround for Flores and his team, it was the dream assignment. “Science fiction has always been a very important source of inspiration for our designs,” said Flores. “Science fiction has always taken that leap forward, looking at what technology is currently and what technology could evolve into. “We want to be part of that movement of creating what the future looks like — not only visually, but also technologically.” The London-based architecture firm is no stranger to technology. The firm’s namesake, Zaha Hadid, was a pioneer in digital design, and the tools she used enabled her to create dynamic, futuristic buildings. “We can only create these types of geometries using polygonal modeling software,” explained Flores, which creates a “three-dimensional simulation of the building.” With this project, the technology was not only key to creating an ambitious design, but also executing it rapidly. Just two weeks after the firm won the competition, construction on the project began. Using a variety of design software, including digital modeling analysis, the team was able to accelerate the timeline, and ensure that everyone, from architects to materials manufacturers to construction workers, was on the same page. Satoshi Ohashi, another one of the project directors, said that construction and design happening in parallel “could not have been done without these new tools.” Ohashi added that the digital modeling analysis allowed the team to optimize the building’s structure for Chengdu’s climate. By analyzing weather and environmental parameters, the software informed decisions about the size and angle of the roof overhang to protect interiors from direct sunlight. Green tech is integrated to minimize the building’s operating impact, too, with solar panels embedded into the expansive roof to help power the building, and skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows to reduce the need for artificial light during the day. The team also had to source materials locally to save time and come up with simple ways of making their concept a reality. For example, they created a modular aluminum panel system that sits “underneath the skin” of the roof canopy, which creates “smooth and seamless” curves while also making it quick to produce in a factory, said Ohashi. Already home to more than 20 million residents — and growing — Chengdu has rapidly expanded in the last few decades. Earlier this year, the city topped China’s new first-tier cities list, which ranks metropolises based on factors like resident lifestyle, commercial opportunities, and transport. The Science Fiction Museum is part of a larger “Future City” development in the Pidu district, outside of the city. Known as Chengdu Future Science and Technology City, the 4.6-square-kilometer (1.8-square-mile) site will house multiple new universities, laboratories and offices. “Part of that growth is also this attention to the future, science and technology, integrating that into the city, and growing that economy,” Ohashi explained. The nation’s multi-billion dollar “science fiction industry” includes publishing and film releases, with Chengdu at the center. Chengdu is also the birthplace of Science Fiction World, one of the world’s most-read sci-fi magazines, which was founded in the city in 1979. The museum opened on schedule to host its inaugural event — the first time Worldcon has been hosted in China, and only the second time in Asia. Dave McCarty, vice-chair of Chengdu Worldcon and an organizer with the event for two decades, described the museum as “the best facility by far that the Worldcon has ever been hosted in,” and said having a purpose-built location made the event feel more special compared to hosting it in “cookie-cutter” convention centers. “Having that dedicated space makes a wonderful home for science fiction,” McCarty added. With its successful bid to host the 81st Worldcon, Ohashi hopes that the new museum and event space can become “an iconic landmark that will represent their science fiction industry” and will nurture the ambitions of the burgeoning “Future City.” “They can now say that they are China’s science fiction capital,” he said.",Style
"Skeletons unearthed in ‘incredibly rare’ 5,000-year-old Scottish tomb"," The ruins of an “incredibly rare” 5,000-year-old tomb have been uncovered on one of the Scottish Orkney Islands, National Museums Scotland said in a statement on Tuesday. The excavation at Holm, East Mainland, Orkney, revealed a stone structure accessed through a 7-meter (23-foot) -long passage and traces of a cairn – or pile of stones – that would have covered it, representing the “pinnacle of Neolithic engineering in northern Britain,” the statement said. Fourteen articulated skeletons of men, women and children, as well as other human remains, were discovered in one of the six smaller side cells that surrounded a large stone chamber. “In the Neolithic, it would have been an incredibly impressive 15 meter diameter, enormous mound, very substantial stonework, very impressive architecture. Those cells are real feats of engineering,” Hugo Anderson-Whymark, one of the excavation’s co-directors and senior curator of prehistory (Neolithic) at National Museums Scotland, told CNN. Two of the skeletons had been positioned so that they were almost embracing against each other, with two children placed over their heads, Anderson-Whymark said. However, archaeologists have not yet determined the relationships between these individuals. “The preservation of so many human remains in one part of the monument is amazing, especially since the stone has been mostly robbed for building material,” archaeologist Vicki Cummings, head of the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University, who co-directed the excavation, said in a statement. “It is incredibly rare to find these tomb deposits, even in well-preserved chambered tombs and these remains will enable new insights into all aspects of these peoples’ lives,” she added. Only 12 other similar tombs are known to exist in Orkney, referred to as Maes Howe-type passage graves. Most of these remain visible in the landscape – unlike this latest discovery which was buried below ground. It was largely destroyed in the late 18th or early 19th century to provide stone for building a farmhouse, according to the statement, but later rudimentary excavations in 1896 uncovered eight skeletons and prompted local antiquary James Walls Cursiter to hypothesize that it was a ruined tomb. Papers held in a private collection of Curister’s notes contained more clues that allowed archaeologists to undertake a geophysical survey in the hope of pinpointing the potential tomb, and provide the basis for the excavation. “It was quite a surprise to make that discovery,” Anderson-Whymark said. “It’s such a big thing but yet today it’s just a gently rolling field of grass. There’s nothing on the surface to suggest this tomb ever existed there but it would have once been an incredible monument. We’re fortunate they’ve left us just enough of it.”",Style
See inside the $50M penthouse that will crown the Waldorf Astoria Miami," The developers behind Miami’s glittering Waldorf Astoria supertall have unveiled the first look at the 1,049-foot tower’s $50 million penthouse, one of the most expensive units to come to market in the city. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom property — which spans some 13,000 square feet — will sit at the top of the nine stacked cubes that make up the vertiginous building, situated on a waterfront stretch in downtown Miami. It’s currently slated to be completed in 2027 by architect Carlos Ott and the firm Sieger Suarez. Renderings of the penthouse’s interior — designed by the firm BAMO — showcase a modern, airy unit with wraparound windows, enclosed balconies, recessed lighting and luxe marble finishes. Rooms include a private gym, spa, library and theater. And, when it’s completed, the penthouse will stand out in Miami’s (currently) unobstructed sky. Though a number of skyscrapers are being built or have been proposed in the South Florida metropolis, the Waldorf Astoria Miami hopes to top out first. “Even with the great skyscrapers of the world — in Dubai, Hong Kong, New York — there’s a lot of towers,” said Ryan Shear, managing partner of the building’s developer, PMG. With the Waldorf Astoria Miami, he continued, “you get to be on top of a world-class city.” With that in mind, the team at BAMO worked with the theme of “transcendence” as they envisioned the building’s interiors, explained principal designer Anne Wilkinson, which include the shared amenities of the building’s 460 residences and 205 hotel rooms and suites. The Waldorf Astoria brand is known for its mainstays: a grand clock in every location, for example, as well as Peacock Alley, a lounge in the historic New York hotel that has since been replicated in its other properties. In Miami, these spaces are meant to evoke a sense of wonder, with Peacock Alley becoming a “conservatory” in the sky, she said, with sweeping views from three sides on the 19th and 20th floors. On those floors, the building’s version of a signature clock is a three-story pendulum that Wilkinson says no other Waldorf Astoria location “has ever attempted.” From at the building’s restaurant on the 21st floor, the pendulum swings down to Peacock Alley, nearly sweeping its 19th floor at just 3 feet off the ground. In the penthouse, Wilkinson said their team took inspiration from the exterior’s geometric architecture in the palette of surfaces and finishings. “(Carlos Ott) described the skin of the building as this reflective surface… you can imagine every facet of those cubes reflecting a different part of the sky,” she said. “I thought that was such a beautiful notion, so we pulled it into the interior. A lot of our colors are these ethereal grays and blues, and even shifting into nighttime inky colors.” Though the original Waldorf Astoria on New York’s Fifth Avenue is best-known for its ornamental Art Deco architecture, Wilkinson believes the clean lines of the Miami iteration and its sky-high penthouse fit well within its legacy. “If you remember back when Waldorf was originally built, Art Deco was quite avant garde,” she said. “And so to me, I think Waldorf is more about being forward-looking. It’s about the design of the moment.”",Style
Sydney Opera House at 50: See what Australia’s best-known building could have looked like," On October 20, 1973 — exactly 50 years ago this Friday — the Sydney Opera House was opened to great fanfare by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Completed a decade late and vastly over-budget, the unusual-looking building was not an immediate hit with Australians. Yet, in the decades since, its striking shell-shaped roof helped it become an architectural icon and an UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts over 10 million visitors a year. How different things might have been. Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s successful proposal was just one of 233 entries in an international design competition. Launched in 1955 by New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill, who was a long-time advocate of transforming the site of an old tram depot into an opera house, the contest attracted participants from over 30 different counties. A document outlining the competition criteria, known as the “Brown Book,” described certain architectural requirements: The building would, for instance, need a main hall capable of accommodating 3,000 to 3,500 people (though the final building has a capacity of under 2,700) and parking space for 100 cars. The document also addressed issues like ventilation and exit passageways. But, otherwise, designers were encouraged to indulge their imaginations — with organizers setting no limit for how much money proposals might cost to realize. Entrants were asked only for black and white drawings, including floor plans and diagrams, as well as a report that “should be as concise as possible, explaining only matters which cannot be readily explained on the drawings,” the Brown Book reads. So, in 2019, creative studio NeoMam Studios and now-defunct architecture firm Projection Comunicación Arquitectónica set about researching the entries and visualizing, in full color, how some of the proposals might have looked. They picked seven from the 232 unsuccessful entries — a selection process based both on the merits of the submissions and the amount of information available to researchers. “Some of them had a story, some of them were ones we knew we could do a good job with, and some were ones where we thought, ‘It would have been hilarious if they’d chosen something like this,’” NeoMam Studios’ CEO, Gisele Navarro, recalled in a phone interview with CNN. And while Navarro concludes that competition judges ultimately “made the right choice,” she applauded some of the entrants’ “blue-sky thinking.” Quite how close any of these alternatives came to winning may be lost to history. But legend has it that Utzon’s winning design was initially dismissed, only to be saved from the reject pile by Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen, one of the judges. Here are seven of the alternative designs that didn’t make the cut:",Style
Inside the UK’s new $292 million arts center," “It might sound strange, but I’m going to show you the toilets,” said Ellen van Loon, the RIBA-award winning Dutch architect tasked with building the UK’s largest arts and culture center since the Tate Modern in 2003. “We had a DJ in here,” Van Loon points to the far left-hand corner of the sprawling unisex water closet. “Any space can be a performance space, even the toilets.” That is the lofty premise behind Aviva Studios — an ambitious eight-years-in-the-making architectural project hoping to enable the “next step,” as Van Loon put it, in performing arts. With a hefty estimated price tag of £240 million (approximately $292 million), one might assume the new cultural hub to be another crown jewel of the UK capital. Yet the 13,350sq ft Post Industrial structure sits in the center of the city of Manchester — around 200 miles north of London. Investment of this kind in the north of England is rare. Earlier this month, the UK government announced it had abandoned plans to connect Manchester to the middle of the country via the high speed railway line HS2 — Britain’s biggest current infrastructure project. The region’s arts sector, too, has seen a steady decline in government funding over the last decade. But the area might now see some long-awaited expenditure, as Arts Council England (a charity and public organization sponsored by the UK’s Department of Culture) announced last year it would invest £383.5 million in 282 arts organizations across the north of the UK between 2023-2026. Arts Council England have also pledged a further £9.9 million annual investment in Aviva Studios until 2026. During a press tour ahead of the building’s official opening, leader of Manchester City Council, Bev Craig, called the project “a long-term dream.” Manchester, she told international journalists, is “a city that had its place over 100 years ago during the Industrial Revolution.” Many are hoping projects like Aviva Studios will help the city find its place again. Van Loon has worked with Rotterdam-based architecture firm OMA on structures such as Portugal’s Casa de Música, Qatar National Library in Doha and the CCTV tower in Beijing. She was wary of the center becoming another faceless regeneration project. “I was really concerned that this type of Post Industrial architecture would disappear and the city would become full of glossy new buildings,” she told CNN. “I’m always worried about cities trying to look the same. A city like Manchester might say it wants to look like London and I think that’s a pity. It’s really important to keep these characteristics.” Instead, the building’s raw concrete exterior and exposed steel connections are an homage to Manchester’s history as the world’s first industrial city. OMA won the bid to design the arts and culture center back in 2015 with a proposal that took Van Loon just 10 days to draw up, though she admits there have been significant changes to the original blueprint. “We had no design for the back of house area,” she said, alluding to the section of the building that features a green room, dressing rooms and on-site offices. “We didn’t even have a model, but we had an idea. It really was an idea.” The plan was to make a theater and exhibition space that is fully adaptable, flexible and customizable to any artist or event in the books. “​​Most performing areas nowadays are designed fairly traditional with your fixed seating area. There is very little flexibility in those spaces,” she said. “The walls are always in the way, because every artist wants to expand the sides or the back. That made us think, ‘Okay, of course you have to make some walls, but let’s put them where they are obstructing as little as possible.’” Much of what you see when entering Aviva Studios is temporary or removable, made possible by a sprawling canopy of ceiling rigs that envelop the building’s two main performance spaces: “the Warehouse” and “the Hall.” Set design, performers or production apparatus can be hung via a complex grid in the warehouse, which has a working weight of 200 tonnes. Reaching almost 69 feet high, the warehouse can be convincingly transformed into any type of space. It’s also long enough to fit a Boeing 747 inside. On October 13, the warehouse became a futuristic runway for “Trainspotting” director Danny Boyle’s interpretative dance performance “Free Your Mind” — inspired by the 1999 classic “The Matrix.” Dreamt up by British stage designer Es Devlin, a soft white circular wall hangs inside the warehouse. Two white portholes at either end of the runway open into the wall, which become stage right and stage left for the dancers. Above, a long block of LED screens dangle down from the grid. The effect of hanging set design as opposed to building it from the ground up lends an immersive, 3-dimensional quality to the space. It’s the type of “contemporary thinking” Van Loon hoped her building could engender. There’s also a more traditional theater — the hall — which can accommodate approximately 1,600. It’s approximate because the hall boasts a similarly fluid design: While the fixed balcony holds 640, the 323 seats on the lower level can be entirely removed to allow for more standing capacity, while the stage gives way to a sunken pit large enough for an 80 piece orchestra. Most of the walls Van Loon was structurally obligated to install are removable, too. The pièce de résistance of Aviva Studios is the building’s unique ability to conjoin the warehouse and hall space together. A 36-feet-high detachable acoustic wall is all that separates the two areas — sound-proofed so the building can host two events simultaneously, but flexible enough to be removed entirely. This architectural feat was one of the flourishes of Boyle’s opening night. While attention remained on the lead dancer twisting in a Gareth Pugh-designed ethereal red dress, the back of the stage began to rise up like a giant curtain revealing a hidden depth that made the stage look more like a street. “It’s rare that I have a client where I propose a new concept and they go along with you,” said Van Loon. “Normally they say, ‘Oh, has that been done somewhere else?’ And when I say ‘No,’ the answer is ‘Okay, no, too risky.’ But I think this building, whatever you might think about it — maybe some users don’t like it, some others do — is at least an example of how things can be done in a different way.”",Style
World’s tallest wooden tower to be built in Australia," Western Australia may soon be home to the world’s tallest wooden building, after authorities in Perth green-lit plans for a 191.2-meter-tall (627-foot) “hybrid” tower constructed using mass timber. On Thursday, Perth’s Metro Inner-South Joint Development Assessment Panel (JDAP) approved Grange Development’s proposal for the skyscraper, currently dubbed the C6 building, which would stand nearly twice as high as the current record holder. The developers say 42% of the proposed tower will be constructed from timber, with the columns and core made of reinforced concrete. If completed, the high-rise will surpass the world’s tallest timber-concrete hybrid building, the Ascent tower in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which stands at 25 stories or 86 meters (284 feet), according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. The proposed structure, located on Charles Street in South Perth, will also be taller than the forthcoming hybrid timber Atlassian Headquarters in Sydney, which is poised to claim the record from Ascent but is yet to be completed. Like Atlassian, the proposed C6 tower will combine laminated timber beams with a steel exoskeleton to support the the structure. According to Grange Development, the 50-story tower will contain more than 200 apartments and will be Western Australia’s first carbon-negative residential building. “The intent of C6 has always been, at its core, a straightforward proposition,” Grange Development’s director, James Dibble, said in a press release. “Our aspiration with C6 is to shift the focus towards a more climate-conscious approach.” The tower will use 7,400 cubic meters (over 260,000 cubic feet) of timber harvested from 600 trees, according to Grange. “We can’t grow concrete,” Dibble said in a proposal submitted to Perth authorities, calling the plan “a new open sourced blueprint that utilizes hybrid construction methodology to offset the carbon within our built environment, which is the single biggest contributor to climate change.” “This is our opportunity to state that we genuinely care about both the housing crisis before us and the climate crisis we are doing very little about as an industry,” he added. Beyond using timber, Grange’s plan also includes green features such as a rooftop garden, an urban farm and resident access to 80 new fully-electric Tesla Model 3s. Philip Oldfield, an associate architecture professor and head of the University of New South Wales’ School of Built Environment, told CNN he thinks, environmentally, the project has “strong credentials”. “Typically we build tall buildings out of steel and concrete. Cement is responsible for 8% of all CO2 emissions. So by replacing concrete and steel with a bio material such as timber, it is going to reduce the environmental impact of the building quite significantly,” Oldfield said over the phone. However, he expressed skepticism about some of the developer’s other claims. “I’m a little more cynical about the idea that it’s carbon-negative,” Oldfield said. “The only way it would be carbon negative is if the building stored more carbon in the timber than was released (by) the other materials. That may be possible but that’s always going to be temporary.” Nevertheless, Oldfield is optimistic about the growing use of timber in construction. “Overall I think it’s a great move forward,” he said. “We do need to be building far more of our buildings out of timber.”",Style
Look of the week: Emily Ratajkowski and the ultra-cinched puffer," In the not too distant past, the silhouette to beat was no silhouette at all. For many years fashion’s preference was slouchy and sloth-like — from ballooning wide leg pants to enveloping raglan coats. A-listers such as Justin Bieber, Bella Hadid and Zoe Kravitz helped keep the oversized fit firmly in vogue, whether it was Bieber’s two-sizes-too-big Balenciaga suit at the 2022 Grammys or the billowing wool overcoats Kravtiz is often seen wearing out in New York. But while the boxy cut remains, this year a counter trend has emerged. Suddenly, it seems there is no body part more important than the waist. Almost overnight, eliminating this crucial curve through straight-cut clothes has become sacrilegious. Enter the built-in belt: designed to cinch and snatch the midriff of any garment it’s embedded within. Yesterday, Emily Ratajkowski — who has been a pioneer of the style for a number of years — was seen walking her dog in a tightly belted puffer jacket. She paired her coat, unnaturally contorted into an hourglass shape, with black yoga pants and chunky gold hoops. Harper’s Bazaar cited the cinching trend as “a styling trick we should all be adopting.” On Monday, Jennifer Lawrence went viral for belting her black wool Dior coat at the Saks Fifth Avenue Christmas light switch-on. Or rather, Lawrence went viral for the belt springing off her body mid-speech. Never one to be thrown through a loop, the “Hunger Games” actor persisted after a quick acknowledgement: “I’m so sorry, that was so loud, my belt popped off!” For those concerned about a repeat of Lawrence’s wardrobe malfunction, there is now an expansive offering of sewn-in cinching devices: on Proenza Schouler’s Fall-Winter 2023 runway, Chloe Sevigny strutted in a white ‘70s collared shirt and black blazer dramatically tied at the waist with a leather rope. Danish designer Cecilie Bahnsen has reimagined the denim jacket with a V-shaped corset structure and gathered hip inserts. While every retailer from French Connection to The Frankie Shop are selling crisp white shirts with waist darts or fabric ties. For the more casual punters, independent London designer Dilara Findikoglu has just released T-shirts with integrated waspies — a head-spinning hybrid of cotton jersey up top and traditional boning on the bottom. Even fast fashion got the memo — more than 1,300 people have left reviews for a bodice-style zip-up hoodie on Cider.com. “Cute and comfy and snatches your waist,” wrote one reviewer. “It gives the perfect shape to your body and looks spectacular.” The sculpted hourglass shape has symbolized a particularly exaggerated version of femininity that has fascinated humanity for centuries — and while the look is fraught with ideas of disempowerment and female oppression, fashion has been slowly but surely reviving waist-centric designs over the last few years. From the Gen Z-approved range of corsets designed by LA-based label Miaou to the resurgence of low-rise jeans, showing off one’s middle has become top priority. Now, perhaps the final frontier is making sure we can wear our waists, á la Ratajkowski, even during a winter dog walk.",Style
Meet the Thai celebrities — and ‘boys love’ stars — becoming fashion’s newest power players," (CNN) — Back in February, Nattawin Wattanagitiphat’s fans spared no expense in marking the Thai actor’s 29th birthday. Videos that made their way onto social media showed ‘Apo,’ as he is affectionately known, wading through a sea of flower bouquet stands, multiple cakes towering over six feet tall, gold bars, cash and even a Rolex watch all gifted by his fan base. Local media reported his birthday haul totaled 50 million Thai baht, or around $1.4 million. With such an army of intense supporters behind him, it’s little wonder then that Apo was named by Christian Dior as a men’s ambassador this summer, along with his co-star Phakphum ‘Mile’ Romsaithong. The two actors, who star as an on-screen couple in a BL television series (a “boys’ love” drama featuring gay romance themes) called “KinnPorsche,” have become a valuable marketing vehicle for the brand. The pair have appeared at events across Asia, including Dior’s show in India, and on the covers of various editions of Vogue, GQ and other magazines. One reason they provide a good return on investment is the remarkably high engagement they generate on social media. Data from a report released by Lefty.io, a social media analytics company, and public relations firm Karla Otto found that Apo and Mile were ranked 3rd and 5th in earned media value for the Spring-Summer 2024 show season on Instagram and TikTok — only after Kylie Jenner and Zendaya, who have 399 million and 185 million followers respectively on Instagram. In comparison, the Thai actors have just 3.5 million Instagram followers each. Still, they are able to induce a fanaticism that’s typically only seen with South Korean stars. But Apo and Mile are not the only Thai celebrities gaining traction as brand ambassadors, campaign models and fashion muses. The country has emerged as a hotspot for talent, with Dior adding yet another Thai ambassador this month, actress Tontawan Tantivejakul. Dior would not be drawn on its decision to focus on Thai celebrities, instead describing the three ambassadors in a statement as “exceptional personalities who are always singular, audacious, virtuosos of their fields, symbolizing the zeitgeist.” But the growing popularity of ambassadors from Thailand is no doubt underpinned by the country’s status as a key emerging market for luxury brands, and its role as a cultural, economic and tourism hub not only for Southeast Asia but the wider Asia-Pacific region. Famously welcoming to foreigners, its capital Bangkok frequently ranks as the most visited city in the world according to the Mastercard Index.  And the Thai luxury market is “leading growth” in Southeast Asia, according to a report released this month by consultancy Bain & Company. Thailand’s biggest global star is arguably musician Lalisa Manobal from the K-pop girl group Blackpink. Better known as Lisa, the Celine and Bulgari ambassador has 99 million followers on Instagram. There’s also Bambam (real name Kunpimook Bhuwakul) who followed the K-pop trajectory to fame as part of the now defunct boyband GOT7. He has appeared in YSL Beauty ads and, more recently, attended Pharrell Williams’ debut Louis Vuitton show. But more often than not, the Thai stars who are able to build international fan bases tend to be actors. Davika Hoorne, who starred in Pee Mak, Thailand’s highest grossing film of all time, was named Gucci’s first global brand ambassador from the country last year. Urassaya Sperbund, the Thai-Norwegian actress and model who starred in a Louis Vuitton watch campaign in 2019, rose to international acclaim earlier thanks to a feature in American Vogue. Some of the actors generating the biggest buzz are male celebrities, more specifically those appearing in gay romance plotlines. This summer, ‘Bright’ (Vachirawit Chivaaree), who starred in the popular show “2gether: The Series” was unveiled by Calvin Klein as its new face, on the heels of a Burberry brand ambassadorship. Bright’s co-star on the show, Metawin ‘Win’ Opas-Iamkajorn , has also made a big impact, signing on with Prada at the start of this year. The celebrity endorsement market has evolved into a large enough opportunity that former Vogue Thailand editor Nichapat Suphap this month launched Venture Management, an agency representing leading Thai stars overseas. Starting with six names, in addition to Apo, Mile and Bright, Suphap’s firm manages Wichapas ‘Bible’ Sumettikul, another actor from “KinnPorsche” who starred in a Ralph Lauren fragrance advertisement this year, and actor Kanawut ‘Gulf’ Traipipattanapong, who has appeared at events for Gucci. Currently, Suphap says she’s negotiating deals with luxury watch, luggage and camera brands for her array of celebrities. It’s a far cry from just a few years ago when Thai figures were relegated to the sidelines. “We were not the priority when attending events abroad,” she said. “(Thais) got the leftover looks from western celebrities.” “But now things have changed. Fashion shows shed more spotlight on Thai talents (so) we get custom looks (as) we become more the center of attention, because of the number of fans waiting outside the shows and the amount of online engagement brands get,” Suphap explained. According to data from Launchmetrics, the latest S/S 2024 Christian Dior womenswear show in Paris saw Apo and Mile garner $6 million in media impact value (MIV) each. That puts them nearly on par with Korean musician Jisoo from Blackpink, who generated a MIV of $6.5 million, but ahead of western stars Jennifer Lawrence ($4.5 million), Rosalía ($3.7 million) and Robert Pattinson ($2.7 million). Fatti Laleh, Piaget’s global communications and image director, said she witnessed the fandom for Apo, who she later signed as a friend for the watch and jewelry house, first hand. “He walked with me outside of this five-star hotel during fashion week and I was amazed to see with my own eyes the magnitude of the people that were cheering for him and waiting for him,” Laleh said, adding that many of the fans gathered were European, demonstrating a degree of global appeal. “Beyond the cultural capital, his beauty and aesthetics, it’s what he reaches in media for us.” Although that kind of loyalty may bear a resemblance to the K-pop stars well entrenched within the fashion industry, there are differences to working with Thai talent. Because the Thai entertainment industry is not yet as structured or strictly managed as Korea’s, agencies take a more relatable approach to partnerships, suggests Krisda Witthayakhajorndet, the director of “KinnPorsche.” “Thais are humble and fun,” he said. “Off-screen, I let my actors be themselves… (They’re) not perfect idols. I think the audiences can feel that… I think people are looking for something that’s not that perfect anymore.” Venture Management’s Suphap agrees. “K-pop stars dedicated their lives training (from a young age) to be idols,” but Thai stars, she said, can be more relaxed. For example, they often manage to attend a regular school even while building their public profile. “Of course, we still want to keep them exclusive, but I would say we are more friendly with the fans,” she said. “We say hi to them, we take pictures with some. We don’t really keep the talent in a box like Korean companies do.” Another advantage some Thai celebrities have is their ability to resonate among Chinese audiences. While South Korean celebrities are often still not allowed major exposure  in the country because of political tensions between the two nations, Thais experience no such issue. Moreover, fourteen percent of Thailand’s population are ethnic Chinese — and the number is much higher for those of mixed Chinese-Thai heritage. The biggest obstacle to Thai celebrities becoming even more of a worldwide phenomenon, Suphap said, is something they share with other nationalities across the region: a language barrier. Generally, “they can understand and converse in English of course,” said. “But to give an interview can be a challenge because we can’t express our in-depth knowledge in a matter of seconds. English is definitely the biggest challenge right now.” This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

See the best evening gowns at the 2023 Miss Universe competition," The 2023 Miss Universe pageant will take place tonight in El Salvador’s capital, San Salvador. (It will air in the United States from 8 p.m. ET on the Roku Channel.) Eighty-four contestants — each representing their home countries — will be in contention, but most only briefly: at the beginning of the competition, the field will be narrowed to 20 semi-finalists, selected based on their performance in the pageant’s preliminary stage and, in one case, a global fan vote. As the night progresses, the field will be further winnowed; by the time the pageant’s evening gown round plays out, only 10 contestants will still be in the running for the Miss Universe title (and tiara, of course). While it is tradition for the eliminated beauty queens to walk the stage, en masse, to show off their looks at this point, it’s usually just a brief — and tightly-choreographed — glimpse at all the sequins, corsetry and fishtail trains. All that fashion finery is not lost entirely in the blink of an eye, however: each contestant had their runway moment during the aforementioned preliminary proceedings. In the gallery above, see some of the sartorial highlights. Those competing at the pageant include two transgender women, Rikkie Kollé of the Netherlands and Marina Machete of Portugal, as well as two married women, Camila Avella of Colombia and Michelle Cohn of Guatemala. Nepal’s Jane Garrett, who has competed in the preliminary rounds to much applause from the audience, is also breaking boundaries as the first plus-size model in contention. The 2023 Miss Universe pageant also marks longtime Miss Universe Organization President Paula Shugart’s last year. After 23 years in the role, Shugart announced on Thursday that she was stepping down, a decision she said had been “been months in the making, and not in a response to recent events.” Last week, the pageant’s owners, JKN Global Group, filed for bankruptcy — or “business rehabilitation” — in Thailand, though said the move would not affect this year’s pageant or organization moving forward.

Look of the Week: ‘Succession’ star Brian Cox is no longer dressing for the boardroom," In the five years Brian Cox played vitriolic media mogul Logan Roy in HBO’s boardroom drama “Succession,” viewers mostly saw him on-screen in a navy business suit and burgundy tie. But since the show concluded in May 2023, the Scottish thespian — now 77 — and his stylist Venk Modur have been cultivating a more, well, experimental look. (HBO and CNN share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery). Cox has leant into his “retirement” (at least from the role of Waystar Royco CEO) with loud, florid chintz-printed jackets by independent designer Jasmine Chongo; a firetruck red suede Lowry jacket and matching auburn shades; and now, appearing on the Jimmy Fallon show last Tuesday, a striking pair of faux leather pants that scream — or likely squeak — leisure. His high-shine trousers were made by Budapest-based label Nanushka, offset with a navy pinstripe shirt and a preppy pair of tricolor horsebit loafers from streetwear brand Kith. The slick, camel-colored bottoms were decidedly more flattering when Cox was upright rather than seated, upon which they looked unfortunately flesh-like. The trousers, if seen by Cox’s youngest fictional son, would almost certainly elicit the Roman Roy-ism: “If I cringe any harder I might become a fossil.” Not many understood the vision. “Chap has clearly completely lost his mind,” wrote one X user.  “I wish this app would stop showing me Brian Cox in those leather trousers and loafers,” added another. But Cox is “always down to be the best,” wrote Modur on his Instagram. And he’s not the first man to don a pair of skin-tight leather-look ankle grazers. Freddie Mercury’s high-waisted leather breeches (in black and red) became his unofficial performance uniform during the 1980s, while David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison and even Elvis Presely have been known to talcum-up and tug on a pair. More recently, Joe Jonas has been praised online for his rotating selection of leather pants in red, brown, black and silver during the latest Jonas Brothers tour. There are fewer rules in menswear today than ever before. Once upon a time, even forgoing a tie was considered borderline negligence. “Ever since the Middle Ages, powerful men in the West have covered their throats,” fashion historian Anne Hollander wrote in 2000 in the New York Times — somewhat horrified after seeing the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, then one of the most highly valued corporations in America, at a press conference both in open-neck button-downs. Lo and behold, two decades on, everyone’s favorite faux-CEO is bearing his calves — and more besides — in leather trousers on prime-time television. Fashion is a fickle mistress indeed.",Style
"Prince’s iconic white, ruffled ‘Purple Rain’ shirt is up for auction"," A signature white, ruffled shirt once owned by Prince is expected to fetch thousands of dollars in an online auction this week. The soft, silk garment, which he wore during his performance of “Purple Rain” at the 12th Annual American Music Awards in 1985, is one of a huge collection of items from the late singer’s colorful wardrobe. The Fashion of Prince auction, staged online by US firm RR Auction, comprises 203 items amassed by a French collector, identified only as Bertrand on the company’s website. According to RR Auction, the seller bought the memorabilia directly from designers who worked closely with Prince, as well as from other auction houses. His plan had been to set up a museum dedicated to the rock star, who died in 2016 after overdosing on fentanyl. Prince starred in the movie “Purple Rain,” which was released in 1984. As well as the title song, the soundtrack contained the future hits “When Doves Cry” and “Let’s Go Crazy.” He won two Grammys for it the following year, as well as the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Well known for his lavish wardrobe, Prince wore this style of ruffled white shirt – complete with faux-pearl buttons and shoulder pads – during his “Purple Rain” tour. He performed 98 shows across North America between November 1984 and the following April and wore this particular version of the white shirt during his performance at the 12th Annual American Music Awards. Though in good condition, the shirt displays some signs of wear, including “dimpling to fabric on the wrists and some staining to the right sleeve,” according to the auctioneers. On the website, they say the seller acquired the garment “directly from a designer” who worked on the “Purple Rain” movie and subsequent tour. The shirt, which has so far attracted $15,000 in bids, and the many other items in the collection were on display at a preview event at New York City’s Hotel Chelsea on November 8, including clothing, jewelry, accessories, shoes and guitars. Other highlights from the sale include gem-encrusted brooches worn by the singer during the tour and the round-rimmed sunglasses he wore during his “Sign o’ the Times” era. In a video interview carried out by the Associated Press and published on the auction house’s website, the company’s executive vice president, Bobby Livingston, described Prince as a “revolutionary figure.” “What makes this Prince collection so special is our consignor personally curated this sale in order to tell the story of Prince through fashion,” Livingston said. There has been considerable interest in the auction, which is expected to close on Friday, according to Livingston, who added: “Prince passed away so suddenly and it was such a tragedy. People that love Prince, they are mourning still. They’re emotionally connected to Prince and so they really really want to have something that he actually wore or designed.”",Style
Kate Beckinsale attends Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday in a party dress with a familiar blue gemstone," Kate Beckinsale wore a bejeweled mini dress over the weekend to celebrate Leonardo DiCaprio’s 49th birthday in Los Angeles, and a photograph of the black frock, which featured a colossal blue-gemstone-like accessory belted around her waist, has since made its rounds across the Internet. Though the look seems to be a delightful reference to a famous DiCaprio film, one question has persisted: Which one? Is the gem a blue diamond or blue sapphire? The former, of course, might be a nod to the one of the most famous pieces of jewelry in movie history — the fictional heart-shaped blue diamond from 1997’s “Titanic,” worn by the other important Kate in DiCaprio’s life. But, being that the Heart of the Ocean is well, heart-shaped, a second possible inspiration for the look is a piece of jewelry with more direct significance to Beckinsale. In her co-starring role as Ava Gardner in “The Aviator,” Beckinsale declares to Howard Hughes, played by DiCaprio, that she’s “not for sale,” when he woos her a square-cut blue sapphire necklace. Whichever fictional gemstone Beckinsale made larger-than-life, the statement piece was surprisingly not a custom look for the event, but straight from The Blonds Fall-Winter 2023 collection, which showed during New York Fashion Week in February. Inspired by films such as “Valley of the Dolls” and the jewelry worn by stars like Elizabeth Taylor, the collection — by designer Phillipe Blond and creative director David Blond — was an exuberant, campy celebration of Hollywood glamour, bursting with sculptural corsets, velvet gowns and sequined party dresses that included oversized gemstone motifs. For her night out, Beckinsale paired the ultra-mini with black tights — a near continuation of the pantsless trend, as the runway version of her look was presented slightly shorter as a top — sky-high reflective platform heels and a big black hair bow. Other attendees to the Beverly Hills fête included Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Salma Hayek, Kim Kardashian, Zoë Kravitz and Channing Tatum, according to Harper’s Bazaar. But no one else seemed to celebrate the occasion with such a chic sartorial easter egg, leaving Beckinsale’s look a dazzling win for the night.",Style
"Mushrooms, snails and plant roots: The surprising story of how your clothes got their color"," Madder, cochineal, Mauveine; these words may be unfamiliar but they’re the names of dyes made from a plant, an insect and a chemical that have shaped our world. While indigo is arguably the most recognized dye — the plant which colored King Tutankhamun’s burial shrouds and more recently makes your denim blue — there are dozens of other dyestuffs that have incited murder and subterfuge, made and lost fortunes and turned clothes into a status symbol for thousands of years. In a new book exploring the history of dyes, author and textile designer Lauren MacDonald weaves together the stories and science of color dating from pre-history to today; from the time of natural dyeing to modern synthetic production. “It’s been (at least) 26,000 years since humans started to dye,” the author writes. “Your great grandparents (999 removed) were stirring a bubbling vat of dye… while woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats roamed the earth.” Indeed, in 2009, scientists found fibers of dyed flax up to 34,000 years old in a cave in the Caucasus mountains in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The earliest sample of dye made from madder, an herb plant with lemon-red flowers, was found on a mummy in the remote Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, probably one of the last areas settled by humans. Dated to around 300CE, Yingpan Man the mummy is cloaked in a kaftan of scarlet wool lined with red silk dyed with madder, in a style that hints at Greek, Persian and Chinese influences; proof of the extensive trade routes that existed at the time. A common source of red dye dating back 4,000 years, madder doesn’t produce the reddest red (that award goes to dyes made from insects, including cochineal and kermes), but it still prompted European textile firms to send spies to Turkey from the 15th century onwards, to glean the secrets to creating a colorfast madder red. Meanwhile in the 13th-century Italian city-state of Lucca, dyers protected their livelihoods with ferocious laws. If you were caught using an “inferior” red dye made from roots like madder, instead of crushed bugs like kermes, you risked losing your savings — or one of your hands. Like many dyes, the process for coloring with madder is lengthy, unsavory, and dangerous— making it unfit for the faint of heart (or nostril). According to an 1871 issue of “Scientific American” magazine, there are 11 steps needed to dye wool with madder. MacDonald reports it calls for yarns to be soaked in “weak soda lye, then rinsed in a river. Next, sheep dung is plunged into a soda solution, mixed with olive oil, strained and then combed through the yarn” to get rid of lumps. “The larger the sheep dung/ olive oil lump, the more likely it is that the mixture will catch fire.” Not all natural dyes come from plants. Over the centuries many popular colors have been made from insects and invertebrates. At the apex of the red spectrum sits cochineal, a deep crimson shade MacDonald calls “the most prestigious” natural red dye, made from the parasitic insect of the same name. The use of cochineal dates to between 300 BCE and 200 BCE; it takes about 70,000 dried bugs (the size of a “grain of rice”) to make a pound of dye powder — enough to turn “13 wool sweaters a bright cardinal red.” In the past, purple has also been produced from sea creatures, notably murex snails. Long the color of nobility and the rich, purple is one of the most difficult natural dyes to achieve. Julius Caesar decreed that only he could wear the finest specimens of the color. Another Roman Emperor, the notoriously wanton Caligula, is said to have not taken kindly when Ptolemy, king of Mauretania, wore a purple cloak during a visit and, according to Roman historian Suetonis, had Ptolemy killed. Historic instructions for coveted hues show how audacious the pursuit of color can get. The recipe for Pliny’s Purple, written by Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder and dated to 77CE, calls for 160,000 deveined molluscs caught from the Mediterranean Sea. Purple was there at the start of the modern dyeing boom. In 1865, an English teenager named William Henry Perkin accidentally discovered a synthetic dye in his home laboratory during the school Easter holidays. He would call this, the first mass-produced synthetic dye, Mauveine, an “eye-wateringly vibrant purple” that became all the rage in fashion. Perkins was a rich man by 21, before mauve fell out of favor with the fashionable set. Unable to recreate his success, Perkins lost his fortune in just over a decade. Recent synthetic dyes have also caused a stir. In 2017, blue dogs were found in a river in Mumbai downstream from a paint and plastics factory (a video of the dogs went viral, largely because it highlighted the environmental implications of dumped industrial dyes). But concerns about the impacts of dyeing aren’t new. The book tells the story of Friedrich Goppelsröder, a 19th-century civil servant in Switzerland who exposed factory owner Johann Jakob Müller-Pack, for the careless disposal of arsenic used to make synthetic magenta which was poisoning the town of Basel through its water supply. His campaign led to a ban on arsenic dumping. Dangerous chemical plant processes persist to this day, and overconsumption is an huge issue. According to the Global Fashion Agenda’s Pulse of the Industry Report, the total level of fashion waste forecast for 2030 is 148 million tons and the vast majority of clothing waste ends up in landfills or is incinerated (the equivalent to a rubbish truck full of clothes is dumped in landfill every second). Globally, only 20% of clothing is collected for reuse or recycling. And while headway is being made with innovative practices like water treatment using  contaminant-absorbing mushrooms, and genetic engineering that shifts the DNA of fabrics to require no dye, chemical color is still big business and synthetic dyestuffs are ubiquitous. As MacDonald reminds us, “Textiles surround us almost every moment of our lives—from the crisp cotton sheets we tuck ourselves into at night to the uniforms we don for our daily work…”  The history, the present and future of dyeing is inextricably linked with how we live our lives.",Style
A space for humans and pigeons to share is among the highlights of Dubai Design Week," When you think of Dubai, you might picture its iconic skyline and breathtaking architecture. Now, a group of architects and designers is embracing sustainable innovation to create installations that are only a fraction of the size of the city’s soaring towers, but no less inspired. Among them, Dubai-based Syrian Ahmad Alkattan has created a cocoon-style intimate outdoor social space where designers can “hatch” their ideas. Not only does it offer shade and seating for humans — it also provides shelter to pigeons. Named “Designest,” it is inspired by the historical significance of pigeon towers in the Arabian Peninsula, where buildings that often featured beautiful arches and detailed engravings were built to protect pigeons during harsh weather and collect their feces for use as fertilizer, as well as showcasing the wealth of the tower’s owner. Designest features pigeon nests at the top of the oblong structure, while three arched entrances at the bottom welcome human visitors. The sections for humans and pigeons are separated, and bird feces collected from the top section will be used as fertilizer for plants in Dubai’s Design District. Alkattan’s design is part of the annual Dubai Design Week and won first place in its Urban Commissions competition, which invites designers and architects to develop innovative outdoor furniture. Alkattan said the idea for Designest came from analyzing all the potential users of an outdoor structure in Dubai — not just humans but also the prevalent pigeon population. “The competition asked to design a shading device, a gathering place or a seating area,” he said. “I tried to do all of that together, but I’ve always had an interest in non-human design, and always thought ‘why does everything need to be human-centric?’” Now in its ninth year, Dubai Design Week (DDW), which runs from November 7-12, is the largest event of its kind in the region, consisting of workshops, installations, exhibitions and talks. This year, more than 30 designs for installations submitted for DDW have been built in the city’s Design District. Ahead of the upcoming COP28 climate conference in Dubai, the theme for this year’s design week emphasizes sustainable practices and materials. Mette Degn-Christensen, director of DDW’s flagship design fair Downtown Design, and former director of DDW, said sustainability has been implemented into the event’s design criteria for the past six years, “but this year, it’s really about new forms of sustainable practices, for example not just looking at 3D-printing but also the different kinds of materials you can 3D-print with.” Alkattan’s Designest structure was originally designed to be 3D-printed using recycled glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC), but time, cost and weight constraints meant the prototypes built for DDW use a combination of environmentally friendly methods and materials, including mixing a plant-based plastic alternative with wood powder, and 3D-printing with sand. “Being environmentally responsible with your design from the very early design stages is no more a niche, it’s more of a necessity,” said Alkattan, who is a freelance concept designer and architect. “That’s why I did my Master’s in renewable energy engineering. It’s not related to architecture, but I wanted to … be aware of how to make my design more sustainable from the early design stages rather than it be an afterthought.” Other design installations that fit the sustainability theme include Emirati architect Abdalla Almulla’s pavilion “Of Palm,” made entirely from the indigenous palm tree, and Dubai-based architecture and interior design firm TEE VEE EFF’s “Pulp Fractions,” an installation made from waste cardboard and paper pulp that has been pressed, dried, and molded. “We look for practical designs that are sustainable and scalable across the UAE region,” said Degn-Christensen of the designs that are chosen for DDW. “So [the competition] is a very relevant project not just for what is staged in Dubai Design Week, but where we can see this in the future.” Designest is Alkattan’s third attempt at winning the Urban Commissions category. “Competitions are the best place to express your ideas without being controlled by the views of your clients or the cost, or the feasibility,” said Alkattan. “It helps to push the boundaries of what is really possible.”",Style
People are making furniture out of cardboard. And it looks like this," In the wealthy neighborhood of Mayfair in London, Gallery Fumi — a contemporary design space — is showcasing a new collection of furniture. This would be no surprise were it not for the incongruous material these chairs and tables are made from: cardboard. “Box” has been designed by British furniture designer Max Lamb, and utilizes cardboard boxes that had been building up in his studio. “I find it very difficult to throw things away”, he said, sitting on one of his creations. He finds beauty, he added, “in rubbish, or things that already exist and have already been disposed of.” Although it is one of the cheapest materials available, and often discarded, cardboard is increasingly being used to create both high-end and affordable furniture. While various designers are experimenting with the material to craft provocative pieces, others are harnessing its potential as a seemingly sustainable option for furnishing your home. Lamb cut, folded, assembled and layered cardboard boxes, and also used the material to create layers of paper maché. What has resulted is an intriguing collection of furniture, that retains elements of cardboard box aesthetics — cubist forms and packaging logos — but develops them with unexpected sculptural molding, compositions and earthy paints. Despite the material’s perception as flimsy, the pieces have been designed to withstand practical use. Their strength results from the way Lamb built up layers of corrugated cardboard — the most impact-resistant kind — and used a glue-like mix of wheat and water. Lamb’s new work fits into an ongoing story of cardboard furniture, with an iconic early example being Frank Gehry’s 1972 “Wiggle Side Chair,” part of the “Easy Edges” series the architect designed which embraced the unexpected strength and sculptural potential of layered corrugated cardboard. As a student, Lamb was inspired by Gehry’s works in cardboard, and subsequently created a cardboard table in 2000 that he says his parents still use. More recently, another famous architect turned to the material to make furniture. Having deployed cardboard in innovative architectural projects, Shigeru Ban used it to create his “Carta” collection (1998–2015). Ban designed chairs, a stool, a chaise longue and table with slim cardboard tubes that had been treated with resin to make them waterproof, but combined them with more traditional materials including birch plywood and glass. Since 2020, Berlin-based Ukrainian artist and designer Illya Goldman Gubin has been strengthening misshapen cardboard boxes using resin and fiberglass, and turning them into unusual seats, tables and shelves. The ongoing “Karton” series began in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic when Gubin turned to experimenting with creations that blurred lines between art and functional objects. “I wanted to add a new dimension to my art, something more approachable, that people could touch without needing permission,” he explained over email. Gubin has “fond memories” of playing with cardboard boxes as a child, building make-believe homes and cars. “Cardboard feels simple, yet special,” he said. “Everyone’s had a cardboard box in their hands. Now, I wanted that same box to have a new purpose — to support us.” Gubin likes to describe the idea behind the project as: “what we once carried, can now carry us.” Each of the pieces is unique; he uses the weight of his own body to mold boxes into various crumpled shapes. Although they look like glossy sculptures, the boxes are perfectly functional as seats or tables. “Even though (the pieces) seem delicate, they’re strong,” Gubin explained. “I wanted to make something that surprises the observer.” Moving from the provocative to the practical, the Room in a Box brand — established in 2013 — offers simple and modular cardboard furniture to purchase, touted as both affordable and good for the planet. Using high-grade corrugated cardboard, the German brand promises its pieces — from bed bases to chairs and tables — can last for up to 10 years. Room in a Box garnered attention through posts on TikTok last year, where videos related to cardboard furniture now have over 2.4 million views. The brand appeals to a young demographic who move around and need lightweight, easily transportable options, but don’t like the environmental impact of “fast furniture”. Co-founder Gerald Dissen told CNN over email that Room in a Box’s pieces are far more sustainable than furniture in traditional materials, citing lower carbon footprints and less energy consumption due to the recycled and recyclable nature of its material, lightweight construction, and modular format. But such qualities have also made cardboard a popular choice when it comes to the emergency deployment of furniture, particularly for refugees. In 2011, French designers NOCC, with entrepreneur Julien Sylvain, created the Leaf Bed, a cardboard bed designed to be used by people in refugee camps. With a simple design of pre-cut panels that are shipped with all of the tools and parts needed for assembly, the camp bed has been deployed by the UN Refugee Agency. A cardboard manufacturer involved in the production of Leaf Bed, Smurfit Kappa, also collaborated with Edinburgh Direct Aid (EDA) in 2017 to send aid to refugee camps on the Lebanon-Syria border in cardboard boxes that could be converted into emergency furniture. On a day-to-day basis, cardboard is used as an emergency shelter wherever we look. “We see cardboard on the streets; we see people using it as an insulating, protective material,” said Lamb, acknowledging how such use sits in contrast to his work. “Here I am just making bits of furniture in a gallery.” Although his works may be collectible design pieces (the prices are only available on request), he says the project is a critical reflection on being “a producer of stuff,” and hopes it will demonstrate “the beauty and permanence” of cardboard as a material. “It can be a permanent part of our lives,” he said. “We don’t have to discard things that are secondary to the thing we’re buying or valuing most.”",Style
Sound of the underground: This guitar maker finds music in mushrooms," When you think of a guitar what comes to mind? Maybe it’s a simple maple acoustic, the kind played by countless singer-songwriters over the years, or perhaps a double-necked mahogany electric, favored more by rock-god types.While these classic guitars will always have a firm spot in our playlists, there are some new designs making waves by harnessing some peculiar materials. Guitar maker and master luthier Rachel Rosenkrantz thinks she’s hit the right note crafting bespoke instruments out of biomaterials. From mushroom ukuleles and beehive guitars to banjos made out of kombucha leather, she’s assembled a curious collection of biodegradable instruments. It all began in the early 2000s, when Rosenkrantz was a 21-year-old student in Paris torn between becoming a musician or a visual artist. Guitar-making combined her two passions – but local luthiers said she was too old to start even at that young age – so she stuck with design. Ten years later and a move to Rhode Island in the US changed her tune. She picked up music again, began her training and has been building guitars for nearly 13 years. “Maybe it didn’t happen when I was 21, but now I’m 42 and I’m actually doing it, so it’s never too late,” Rosenkrantz told CNN. Biomaterials entered the picture when she considered the impact guitar-making has on certain tree species. “Even though we [guitar makers] don’t represent a huge portion of the people that consume wood, we do serious damage in some areas,” Rosenkrantz said. “But I think guitar makers are more conscious about where they get their woods.” Around 2.6 million guitars are produced annually in the US alone. But unlike the construction and furniture industries, which favor quick-growing timber, the guitar industry typically uses rarer and older woods such as mahogany, ebony and rosewood. Trees are cut perpendicular to their growth rings for a better sound, and covering an entire guitar’s front, back, and sides means larger logs, like those of old-growths, are needed. Not all of these are sustainable. Brazilian rosewood was once highly prized for guitars, but the tree, found only in the coastal Brazilian Atlantic Forest, faces serious threats from illegal logging to clear land for agriculture and other uses. Since 1992, its use has been effectively banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  Sitka spruce has been widely used to make acoustic guitars, but it’s often taken from Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, where widespread logging for various industries has some guitar makers calling for more sustainable alternatives.   “All it takes is to have some ethics,” Rosenkrantz said. “Just doing the right thing makes a big difference.” Early in her guitar-making career, Rosenkrantz questioned what could be done without wood and plastics. From her background in design, she saw that biomaterials were being used in everything from BMW cars to sneakers. Her entry point was replacing plastic with fish skin, which she sources from a vendor in Brazil who makes tilapia leather out of fish farm waste. “It [fish skin] is stronger than plastic, more pliable than plastic,” she said. “For the pick guard that protects the instrument from scratching, it follows the motion of the wood.” Mycelium – a root-like structure composed of thin threads made by fungi – caught Rosenkrantz’s attention when she saw it used as a packaging replacement for polystyrene. “Polystyrene conducts sound amazingly because it’s full of air,” she observed, “so what if the natural counterpart has the same property?” Once the material dries, it packs together lots of hollow fibers like a spaghetti bundle, so that it resonates in a similar way to wood, explained Rosenkrantz, who also teaches at the Rhode Island School of Design. She sources mycelium from a vendor in upstate New York, and says it can be grown in any shape, meaning that working with it doesn’t leave off cuts that go to waste. Her “Mycocaster” electric guitar is made from mycelium and paper, with dried fibers such as corn husk added to make the guitar body more rigid. Rosenkrantz’s quirky creations sound slightly different from conventional guitars, depending on the biomaterial they are made from. The “Mycocaster” has a twangy and nasally tone. “I didn’t know it would have that timbre,” she said. However, it did make her think that these instruments could serve niche and perhaps novel genres of music. “If we want to create new sounds, we might look into new materials,” Rosenkrantz added. For the Mycocaster, she went a step further by adding some pickups and microphones into the mycelium body which she can adjust depending on how much “mushroom sound” the user wants. A number of her clients have unusual requests. A musician who composes film soundtracks asked for something that could sound like a range of instruments, so Rosenkrantz made a nine-string baritone electro-acoustic guitar, which incorporated waste fish skin. Another musician asked for a guitar with two necks, made completely from upcycled elements. The end result is part guitar and part bass, and was made using the client’s 40-year-old pickups, a vintage cigar humidor box as the body, a handle from an old suitcase, and kitchen backsplash tiles as fingerboard markers. These bespoke guitars don’t come cheap, though. Rosenkrantz’s Mycocaster currently costs $4,000, and she has three orders in the works. She’d like to bring costs down further, but concedes that she’d need help from a bigger manufacturer. “I would love for it to be like 50 bucks and every kid can afford one,” Rosenkrantz said. “Maybe a mushroom guitar is a way to actually achieve that, that would be my dream.” “I have faith in the future,” she added. “What might be considered weird today might not be weird tomorrow.”",Style
A new docuseries follows Juul’s catastrophic crash and burn," As Juul’s popularity began to surge in 2016, the sleek USB-shaped e-cigarette was seemingly everywhere overnight, with clouds of vapor and the audible crackle of a deep pull. If you were a millennial, brought up amid secondhand smoke in homes and restaurants in the ’80s and ’90s (like this writer), Juul’s rise might not have felt so alarming. After all, many longtime smokers were tossing out their cigarettes in exchange for vapes after years or decades of attempts to quit — though, yes, they may have ended up more addicted to their new pocket companions, which claimed to carry fewer health risks than combustible tobacco but packed a big punch of nicotine and could be puffed all day. But if you were a teenager, Juul’s impact was immediately striking — and likely unnerving for your parents — as explored in a new Netflix docuseries. Directed by R.J. Cutler, “Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of Juul” charts how enticing product design, potent influencer marketing and dubious corporate decision-making saw the product’s popularity soar among underage users, too, before the eventual crash of its parent company, Juul Labs. Once one of the fastest-growing startups in the US (valued at $38 billion at its peak), the company has now lost 95% of its value, and has settled $3 billion in lawsuits over its marketing tactics in the US. Nearly all of its flavors have been pulled from the market and the device itself was temporarily banned by the Food and Drug Administration — though that decision is now under review. What made Juul so desirable? Eight years after its launch, the docuseries sets out to answer that question, positing that founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen made a grave error of judgment in treating nicotine as an issue that could be solved by tech, rather than public health initiatives. Early on, the Juul was called “the iPhone of e-cigs” in a Wired review by reporter David Pierce — an association that stuck, given its simple design and magnetic appeal. How Juul Labs was led astray from its original mission — to make cigarettes obsolete — isn’t cut and dry, though Pierce said of the company in “Big Vape” that, “Their goal was not to make people quit smoking; their goal was to make people start Juuling.” Juul’s splashy, aspirational launch campaign promoted the device as a must-have for twenty-somethings, and echoed classic (and long banned) cigarette campaigns, as “Big Vape” points out. “James and Adam really wanted Juul to be seen as a luxurious, sophisticated product that people would not be embarrassed to use, unlike some vaping products which had been seen as dorky and uncool,” said Jamie Ducharme, author of the book that the docuseries was based on, in “Big Vape.” But Juul’s “Vaporized” campaign, shown larger-than-life in Times Square and at pop-ups in cities across the US, seemed to fall flat at first. The e-cigarette could well have been sent to the graveyard of forgotten tech, were it not for word of mouth and, according to “Big Vape,” celebrity use — Bella Hadid, Dave Chapelle, Adele and Jennifer Lawrence are all namedropped in the docuseries — that sent Juul mainstream. For Gen Z, it catalyzed countless memes and hashtags, a new nicotine-fueled social ritual in and out of school, and quite possibly for many, a lifelong habit. “Juul definitely did create a newfound sense of unification for the generation that I grew up in,” Chase Amiratta, who began using Juul as a teenager, said in the docuseries. “Over the past years, Juul Labs has committed to resetting its relationship with our stakeholders and re-earning trust,” a company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to CNN when asked for comment on the docuseries, noting that underage use (that is, by people aged under 21) of Juul products “has dropped by 95%.” “To the extent that this documentary captures that journey, we hope it can help advance a more balanced public dialogue about the opportunity for tobacco harm reduction through effective alternatives like Juul products… ” the spokesperson continued. “Big Vape” neither neatly ties up Juul’s troubles nor addresses the company’s motives. Though a handful of former Juul employees and board members participated in the documentary, it remains unclear how much of its multi-billion-dollar blunder was profit-driven or out of ignorance to the fact that Juul’s appeal among adults, including its flavors, would draw in minors, too. “I literally had people tell me, ‘There’s no way that adults like mango as much as kids do,’” said Erica Halverson, a former marketing manager at Juul, of the bestselling flavor. “That’s a bunch of bulls***t to me. Bulls***t.” “Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of Juul” is out now on Netflix. Read: “Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul” by Jamie Ducharme (2021)Time journalist Jamie Ducharme’s book, which investigates how two Stanford grads’ well-intentioned thesis project became the Juul we know today — served as source material for the Netflix documentary.

"Long-lost ‘Star Wars’ X-wing model up for auction with starting price of $400,000"," A long-lost model of an X-wing fighter used in the original 1977 “Star Wars” movie is up for auction, with a starting price of $400,000. Used in the filming of the final battle in “Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope” as the Rebel Alliance fight the Empire above the Death Star, the model “represents the pinnacle of Star Wars artifacts to ever reach the market,” Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions said. The top two wings of the fighter are both painted with a single red stripe, identifying it as the squadron’s “Red Leader.” The model is part of a collection that belonged to the late Greg Jein, an Oscar- and Emmy-nominated miniature-maker known for his work on “Star Trek” and “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” and will be auctioned on October 14-15. Long known as “the missing X-wing,” it was discovered by a team of visual effects experts, including Gene Kozicki (“Face/Off” and “Flight of the Phoenix”), as they helped Jein’s family sift through his collection, Kozicki told the Hollywood Reporter. “This model has not been displayed or modified since it left ILM (visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic),” Kozicki said. “For those of us that grew up in the ’70s or ‘80s, and those of us that work in visual effects, this model is as significant a find as the ruby red slippers or the Maltese Falcon.” The 1:24 miniature was one of four “hero” models built for filming close-ups in key moments during the space battle, including in shots during the trench run as the rebel fleet seeks to destroy the Death Star. Several “pyro” models were also built according to a much simpler design, which could then be blown up, while the four “hero” models featured intricate painting, wings that spread open into “Attack Position,” a miniature pilot, internal wiring to power lights inside the spaceship as well as minute details such as blast marks and heat-scorching around exhaust nozzles. They were designed by the Oscar-winning team Industrial Light & Magic according to basic specifications from director George Lucas, who wanted to create distinct shapes for the climactic battle so the audience could distinguish between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. Kozicki told the Hollywood Reporter that it isn’t clear how Jein came into possession of this model, speculating that he sometimes obtained items to trade for something else later on. “(Steven Spielberg’s) ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind’ and ‘Star Wars’ were being made at roughly the same time, and with an overlapping group of people,” Kozicki said. “And at that time no one, not even Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, could anticipate the impact these films would have on the industry or cultural zeitgeist.”",Style
Celebrity florist Jeff Leatham is in full bloom," (CNN) — For Jeff Leatham, a floral arrangement isn’t just, well, flowers. It’s an invitation to travel through time. Over the last three decades, the celebrity florist has worked at the highest levels, transforming the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills and Paris, among other venues, with breathtaking installations, curating florals for countless over-the-top weddings and celebrity events — in particular, in a longstanding collaboration with the Kardashian-Jenner family — and receiving accolades including France’s Chevalier Legion of Honour, the highest military and civil honor the country can bestow. In all that time, the florist has witnessed first-hand the power flowers hold to transport the viewer to a pivotal moment in their lives. His job isn’t just about arranging pretty blooms — although he does so with profound skill — but to present a moment of raw, natural beauty that tugs at some core memory. In his latest book, “The Art of the Flower,” Leatham returns to some of those signature, emotive moments. The retrospective also underscores the jaw-dropping scale of so many of his projects: Entire rooms carpeted in red roses, from floor to ceiling; an indoor pool encircled in archway after archway of baby pink orchids; peonies appearing to rain down from the sky. Leatham’s floral designs don’t just take you into the past, they make a definitive imprint on the present. They are, in as much as the flowers themselves are ephemeral, unforgettable. Jeff Leatham: For me, it’s the amount of joy that (a floral arrangement) brings to people. With the work that I do in hotel lobbies, the amount of people rushing by who will stop in their tracks to look and take it all in — that, for me, is so important. When someone sees beauty — especially beauty that’s from nature. I think that’s what attracts me. All these years later, it still really takes my breath away how the beauty of nature takes people aback. They bring back certain memories, especially with different seasons; they’re like old friends that go away and then come back to visit again. There’s also flowers that bring you back to certain times of your life —my father’s mother passed away when I was very young, but every time I see or smell a lilac, it immediately takes me back to when I was four years old, to when I was (visiting) with her and she had giant lilac bushes in front of her house. I think a lot of people have stories like that with flowers. (They take) them back to a moment in their life, whether it be happy or sad — like a time capsule. I think it’s because in life — and especially in my life — you have those fleeting moments where it’s like, “I could not be more happy than I am right now.” It’s the same when you have one of your favorite flowers. It’s pretty, but it’s only going to be like that for one or two days, so hold onto that moment. Enjoy it while it’s beautiful, because it doesn’t last forever. I feel super lucky to live in this time when flowers are so extremely popular. When I moved to Paris in 1992 (and started working with the Four Seasons George V Hotel), we revolutionized the way people thought of flowers — showing them in a really clean, simple, chic way. Very monochromatic, all one type, bunched together, coming out of the base and floating. That really started a revolution. Styles have changed over the years; it’s kind of like fashion in that way… everyone just chooses what best suits their personality. Flowers have also become such a statement of wealth — a status symbol, like pulling up in a really nice car at a wedding. How many flowers can you have to prove how much money you have? Those days I refer to as “The Golden Years.” You had everyone — from Karl Lagerfeld to Lee McQueen and Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs when he was at Louis Vuitton — at the full height and bloom of their career. That really did shape who I was as an artist, because that was a time when anything goes. There were big budgets and big creativity. It was very in your face. It was very cutting edge. I remember, especially, going to McQueen shows — (they) were just so out of this world and creative. Pardon my French, but he didn’t give a fuck. He was pushing the boundaries of design; that really did influence me, and still does — because I feel like that does not exist in fashion anymore. Now it’s like, how many bags and sunglasses and shoes can we sell, rather than, say, let’s make a dress out of seashells. Back then, when I was experimenting, I remember using live birds and butterflies and different things in my work just to push my boundaries. Some of it was successful and some of it failed, but that really made me a better artist. Well, my relationship started with her mom, Kris Jenner. She has taught me a lot because she’s always had such amazing taste and such amazing style. Kimberly also has such a love of art and fashion; she always wants to be on that cutting edge, but in a classic way. She’s definitely not safe. She wants to make a statement. I love working with her because she’s always open to doing different things. She’s always sending me photographs, like, “what if we did something like this but made it our own?” I love the way that she pushes me as a designer. They’re great friends and they’re great clients. We’re very similar in our love of photography and fashion and, especially with Kim, a love of architecture now. Which for me is interesting because a lot of what I do with flowers has to do with architecture. Exactly. I think the architectural aspect of my work really started because I had no idea what I was getting myself into with (the George V hotel) when I started there. It’s just so heavy and French and classical; I was like, I have to do something here that’s the total opposite of this so that my work actually gets noticed, and doesn’t just fade away into the tapestries. that’s when I started to work very architecturally, the flowers in bold colors, very strong bold lines. It really made a difference. And then I won out in the end because all the heavy furniture in the lobby got taken away. Take away the furniture, put in more flowers!",Style
Highlights from the 2023 Miss Universe pageant’s national costume competition," What do dictionaries, fighter planes, plantains and the Swiss Guard have in common? That’s a serious question, but with a delightfully nonsensical answer: All served as inspiration for national costumes on display during the 2023 Miss Universe pageant’s preliminary competition. (Specifically, those were the looks donned by Miss Great Britain, Miss Philippines, Miss Dominican Republic and, yes, Miss Switzerland.) Eighty-four countries are represented at this year’s Miss Universe, which is taking place in the El Salvadoran capital of San Salvador. Among those national titleholders are the first-ever married contestants, following an amendment to the eligibility requirements enacted this year, and two transgender women, representing the Netherlands and Portugal. Miss Nepal, Jane Garrett, is one of the first “curvy” women to compete at Miss Universe; Erica Robin, meanwhile, is the first woman to represent Pakistan at the pageant. The pageant’s preliminary competition got underway Wednesday, with contestants having already participated in days of rehearsals, as well as photo shoots, charity events and excursions. The main event, however, will take place on Saturday night, when the winner of the best national costume will be announced — as will the new Miss Universe, of course, who will take over from the reigning queen, R’Bonney Gabriel of the USA. See some of the contenders for the best costume award below.",Style
Woman makes record-breaking wig longer than seven Olympic swimming pools," A woman from Lagos, Nigeria, has entered the record books after weaving a handmade wig that measures 351.28 meters (1,152 feet, 5 inches) in length. Professional wigmaker Helen Williams spent more than two million naira (almost $2,500) and 11 days making the wig, which is longer than seven Olympic swimming pools. Williams first made the underlay using wig-cap netting and black fabric fixed to a bicycle helmet, before using 1,000 bundles of hair, 12 cans of hair spray, 35 tubes of hair glue and 6,250 hair clips to complete the piece, according to a statement from Guinness World Records. “Finding the materials to make the longest wig was not an easy task,” said Williams in the statement. “My experience as a wigmaker helped a lot.” She has been making wigs for eight years and produces 50-300 per week. “I have trained hundreds of students and have made thousands of wigs,” said Williams, although her record-breaking endeavor still proved difficult. “At some point, I felt exhausted,” she said. “However, friends and family encouraged me. I did not want to let them down, so I maintained my focus. The outcome is the longest handmade wig in the world.” Given its size, Williams found it difficult to find a space to lay out the wig to be measured. She eventually managed to do so along the highway between Lagos and the city of Abeokuta. Now, the wig is kept in her office, available for people to admire “whenever they want to,” she said. “My advice to everyone out there is: dreams are attainable,” said Williams. “However, the journey is a very rough one.”",Style
‘It’s something essential’: Inside the exhibition reframing beauty," What do a 17th-century European woman and an image-conscious Gen Z-er have in common? For one, both might choose to adorn a blemish mark with a star-shaped sticker. In the 17th and 18th centuries, women (and sometimes men) bought beauty patches to cover smallpox, syphilis scars, or simply accentuate their pale skin. Today, they’re sold in drugstores across the world to “shrink and shield” acne. According to “The Cult of Beauty,” a new exhibition at London’s Wellcome Collection museum, many contemporary skincare regimes and the beautifying practices of yore are far more similar than we realize. And the show’s curators have cleverly arranged over 200 intriguing items to demonstrate how. Inside a glass display case, a 2018 red-light therapy “photon” face mask — an at-home treatment that still feels futuristic — sits next to its terrifying predecessor from 1950s Germany. Elsewhere, two jars of foundation, made 2,000 years apart, employ precisely the same marketing strategy: a beautiful woman’s visage etched on the lid. A 1920s hand-held “Punkt-Roller” (a German stomach roller designed to accentuate ab muscles) is paired with an upper-arm cellulite blitzer from 2000s Japan. “It shows how much has changed — and not changed,” curator Janice Li told CNN during a tour of the exhibition. Li’s thesis reflects the exhibition’s overarching message: that the pursuit of beauty is innately human. By chronicling a wide range of artefacts, the oldest of which date back to Ancient Egypt, it hopes to reframe our perceptions of beauty — from a new-age, vain or superficial phenomenon to something anthropological, historical and inescapable. “We want to take away the labels of ‘frivolous and secondary,’” said Li. “(Beauty) is something we do every day. It’s primary and essential.” Of course, industry attitudes towards beauty and femininity have shifted dramatically in recent decades. Haunting objects, such as a 1950s “maternity” corset, created to support — and perhaps more importantly, conceal — a baby bump, for example, or a miniature girdle for a Victorian infant, are morbidly fascinating. A “Miss World” board game from 1972 sees players lose points for being “too fat” or having tattoos. A life-size Barbie doll on display, meanwhile, is bang on trend — though this version stands in stark contrast to Greta Gerwig’s feminist blockbuster. The scaled-up figurine was created by mannequin designer Adel Rootstein in 2009 using Mattel’s original measurements. The doll’s body (including a near-impossible 21-inch waist) is so disproportionate it requires support from steel mounts to stay upright. But who is this all for? After all, chasing beauty and youth — an instinctive impulse, the show suggests — often ends in disappointment, delusion, sometimes even death. Take, for instance, Diane de Poitiers, who very likely died from drinking liquid gold for its purported rejuvenating and anti-inflammatory properties. An 1841 lithograph of the French noblewoman hangs near the exhibition’s entrance alongside a 24-carat gold facial serum on sale today — a poignant reminder to anyone tempted to mock De Poitiers’ fate. The exhibition proposes refreshing answers to time-honored beauty industry questions. For those who believe hair and makeup exist purely for the male gaze, a  2009 image of the Brazilian prison beauty pageant “Miss Penetencaria,” taken by photographer Zed Nelson inside an all-female facility in Rio, suggests otherwise. Similarly, research from racial social history academic and author Emma Dabiri speaks to the idea that beauty’s obsession with whiteness came long before Western colonialism. A restored replica of a 7th-century sculpture of a Greek goddess shows her dark hair, painted face and, crucially, white skin. “It was an ideal that was pursued for a long time,” said Li, pointing to a 16th-century Chinese recipe for skin-whitening pearl powder. “This goes back to the association with status. In an agricultural society, as in Chinese culture (at the time), if you were an upper-class lady, you didn’t get out of the house.” While Li and her colleagues take an unblinking look at what is now a $625-billion industry (the exhibition’s crescendo is another Nelson photo gruesome photo of a patient undergoing a facelift) the show is more a measured celebration than a scathing criticism. A wall of magazine “firsts” — including the first US Vogue cover to feature a Black woman, model Beverly Johnson, who fronted the August 1974 issue, and this year’s Vogue Philippines cover starring an 106-year-old woman, the first centenarian to front any edition of the fashion magazine — are a paper-trail of progress. So too is a section of the show loaned by the nearby Museum of Transology, an institution dedicated to documenting transgender, non-binary and intersex issues. An array of seemingly mundane cosmetic products from the museum’s collection each come with a touching handwritten memory from their anonymous owner: The first lipstick given to the subject by their sister, in a small gesture of acceptance; the long brown weave hastily grabbed by a victim of intolerance as they were kicked out of the family home, a solitary piece of armor seeking to protect its wearer against gendered violence. Each item reminds visitors of the sometimes essential value of beauty. “It’s human nature,” said Li. “And it’s serious work.”",Style
Miss Universe owner files for bankruptcy days before pageant," The owner of Miss Universe, JKN Global Group, has confirmed that next week’s pageant will go ahead, despite the Thai firm filing for bankruptcy. The media distribution company, which bought the Miss Universe Organization for $20 million in 2022, announced on Thursday that it had submitted a petition for “business rehabilitation” that was accepted by Thailand’s bankruptcy court. In a statement published on its website, JKN said providing a “top notch experience” to Miss Universe fans “will remain a top priority” ahead of next Saturday’s finale. The firm expressed confidence that its new financial arrangements will “support all of the company’s business operations, including Miss Universe.” Run by Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, a transgender rights advocate and the star of Thai versions of reality shows such as “Project Runway,” JKN said last year that it planned to grow the Miss Universe Organization by expanding in Asia and releasing branded merchandise. Declaring bankruptcy does not necessarily mean a company is about to go out of business. Many major firms have used bankruptcy filings as a tool to shed debt and costs they can no longer afford. JKN, which had raised money through bonds to buy Miss Universe, missed a loan repayment deadline of around $12 million that was due September 1. In its filing, the company said it planned to restructure its debt and extend the repayment period to overcome what it called a “liquidity problem.” In a press conference at the time, Jakkaphong said market conditions, including high inflation, made it difficult for the firm to roll over its debt. Jakkaphong, who has been outspoken about her experiences as a trans woman, took over Miss Universe — one of the world’s most-watched beauty pageants — as it reckoned with growing calls for greater diversity and inclusivity. This year’s pageant will feature two trans women for the first time: Marina Machete, a 23-year-old flight attendant who was crowned Miss Portugal last month, and Rikkie Kollé, who became the first transgender winner of Miss Netherlands in July. “Trans women are women, full stop,” the Miss Universe Organization told CNN last month, following Miss Portugal’s crowning. “We are here to celebrate women, full stop. This has been true for more than a decade, and we’re proud to have made this change very early on, compared to other programs.” If either candidate wins, they will become the first trans woman to wear the tiara. In 2018, Spain’s Ángela Ponce was the pageant’s first trans contestant, but did not advance to the finals. Miss Universe, which has been running since 1952, scores contestants based on personal statements, in-depth interviews, and evening gown and swimwear competitions. This year’s final in El Salvador will see nearly 90 women from around the world compete for the crown. JKN Global Group did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.",Style
Miss Universe will feature two trans contestants for the first time," This year’s Miss Universe pageant will feature at least two trans women for first time, after 23-year-old flight attendant Marina Machete was last week named Miss Portugal. Machete will compete for the crown at the 72nd Miss Universe competition in El Salvador this November alongside Rikkie Kollé, who in July became the first transgender winner of Miss Netherlands. In a video posted to the Portuguese pageant’s YouTube channel ahead of the contest, Machete spoke about trans rights as part of her platform, describing rising levels of “transphobia and intolerance” worldwide as “alarming.” She added that it was “heartwarming” to see the Miss Universe Organization, which changed its rules to allow trans contestants in 2012, being inclusive and “breaking boundaries.” “As a trans woman I’ve been through many obstacles along the way, but fortunately, and especially with my family, love proved to be stronger than ignorance,” she said in the video. If either candidate wins, they will become the first trans woman to wear the tiara. In 2018, Spain’s Ángela Ponce became the pageant’s first trans contestant, but did not advance to the finals. Neither Machete nor Miss Portugal’s organizers responded to requests for interview, though in a statement to CNN the Miss Universe Organization said: “Trans women are women, full stop. We are here to celebrate women, full stop. This has been true for more than a decade, and we’re proud to have made this change very early on, compared to other programs.” Over the past decade, Miss Universe, one of the world’s most-watched beauty pageants, has reckoned with growing calls for greater diversity, representation and inclusivity. The organization lifted its ban on transgender contestants after Jenna Talackova, a trans competitor in the Miss Universe Canada national pageant, was told by organizers she would be disqualified because she had undergone gender-affirming surgery and thus did not meet requirements for the pageant. At the time, Miss Universe officials insisted the change was made in spite of, not because of, legal action threatened by a lawyer acting on Talackova’s behalf. In 2022, the Miss Universe Organization was bought by Thai media tycoon and transgender rights advocate Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, the star of Thai versions of reality shows such as “Project Runway,” for $20 million. Jakrajutatip, who is also CEO of JKN Global Group, a Thailand-based media distribution company, has been outspoken about her experiences as a trans woman. In a statement provided to CNN on Thursday, the Miss Universe Organization said it is “always evolving” and updating entry rules, adding that in the last two years married and divorced women, pregnant women and women with children have been allowed to join. In 2024, organizers will also remove the age limit that currently restricts entry to those 28 and under. “Starting next year, every adult woman in the world will be eligible to compete to be Miss Universe,” the statement added. Both Machete and Kollé have used their platforms to promote a more inclusive vision of beauty pageants, and to encourage others to feel inspired. “Miss Universe asked us to describe ourselves in one word,” Kollé said in a video posted to her Instagram page ahead of the Miss Netherlands final. “The word I’m choosing is ‘victory,’ because as a little boy I conquered all the things that came through my path — and look at me now, standing here as a strong, empowering and confident trans woman.” “Never forget that we can do this together, you’re not alone on this planet. Never stop dreaming of being your ultimate and confident YOU!” she wrote in the accompanying caption. “Never let someone tell you what’s good for you, because the only thing that matters is that you become the best version of yourself.” Miss Universe, which has been running since 1952, scores contestants based on personal statements and in-depth interviews, as well as evening gown and swimwear competitions. This year, nearly 90 women from around the world will compete in the pageant. While almost all the finalists have now been selected, a handful of countries, including China, are yet to confirm their representative.",Style
"‘I want the fragrance everywhere.’ Why Tyler, the Creator is betting on beauty"," Tyler, the Creator has long believed in scarcity. Limited-edition drops for his skate-inspired clothing line Golf Wang and collaborations with Converse and Lacoste are what made fans line up in droves for his colorful sneakers, polo shirts and hats for the last decade. But as his nearly two-year-old luxury lifestyle brand Golf le Fleur grows up, the musician-turned-designer is taking a new approach to his beauty portfolio. “I can’t front. I want the fragrance everywhere,” he said. Like hip-hop contemporaries Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, Tyler Gregory Okonma — better known as Tyler, the Creator — has cultivated a unique aesthetic and built lifestyle brands while making music. The Grammy-winning artist is best known for his fashion influence, with ties to the late Virgil Abloh and skate brand Supreme. But it’s his fragrance, French Waltz, that has become the bestseller for his budding brand, over nail polishes, clothing, eyewear and luggage. Earlier this month, the artist expanded his beauty proposition to a number of physical retailers, adding 10 additional Neiman Marcus locations, from a sole outpost in Beverly Hills, and launching in Dover Street Parfums Market in Paris. These partners join Bergdorf Goodman, Arielle Shoshana and several independent boutiques globally. The brand hopes to grow wholesale to 20% of its total revenue, up from 10% today. “I’m not an online shopper, much. I don’t even use Uber Eats. I go to restaurants,” Tyler said. “For me, in-store experience is number one, because I’m a person with senses that work.” Best known for his genre-bending musical career that began with his hip-hop collective Odd Future, Tyler’s style has evolved just as his music has. He played a major role in the rise of Supreme; resale site Grailed reported that he drove the highest number of Google searches for Supreme above A$AP Rocky, Travis Scott and Justin Bieber between 2011 and 2015. He is also credited with pioneering what is now called “grandpacore” fashion well before TikTok discovered it. He quickly became known as a trendsetter, which led to the launch of skate and streetwear brand Golf Wang in 2011. An elevated sub-brand, Golf le Fleur, first appeared five years later with Converse and Lacoste collaborations, and was spun off into a standalone label in 2021. Tyler has said the foray into luxury was encouraged by Abloh, with whom he had close ties — he composed the score and starred in the designer’s last Louis Vuitton runway collection in January 2022. A 100-milllileter bottle of Golf le Fleur’s French Waltz fragrance retails for $200, and a luggage collection sells for $155 to over $3,000. “He’s aged with his fan base from those skater kids … to now talking about houses, talking about cars and talking about skin care and talking about watches. I think it’s quite a refined vision,” said 20-year-old fashion designer Fintan Fox, a self-proclaimed Tyler fan. Though many celebrity brands have garnered a collective eye roll from the public, Tyler seems to have an elusive component that some other beauty founders like Brad Pitt and Jared Leto may lack: intensely devoted fans ready to buy his products. “He is one of those artists that has that die-hard fan base,” said Marina Mansour, vice president of beauty and wellness at creator marketing agency Kyra. “Tyler’s basically a business, but he’s done it in a way that you kind of didn’t really notice because it’s not like he suddenly was the face of everything and shoving merch down everyone’s throats.” Tyler has kept his name and photo off products to mitigate the risk of online backlash that has plagued celebrity founders. “If I f**king ran over a cat, I don’t want people to fully disregard that great scent because my face is on it and they hate me now,” he said. His mentions of skin care and his fragrance in song lyrics have made Tyler’s jump from fashion to beauty more seamless. (French Waltz is frequently referenced on his 2021 album “Call Me if You Get Lost.”) “He does talk about beauty; he’s always got his nails done. Aesthetics are such a big part of him,” added Mansour. Thus far, shoppers have mostly bought into Tyler’s beauty vision online, but the founder stressed the importance of experiencing beauty in store. Acknowledging that he does not have a strong female-focused customer base, Tyler said that the move into Neiman Marcus will allow him to reach a wider audience. “I like that it will be people who have no idea who I am who get to not only smell the fragrance, but also smell it from a blank state,” he said. In addition to more retail locations, Tyler hopes to open a standalone Golf le Fleur store. He is also taking it slow with category expansion, but stated that French Waltz is just his “first” fragrance. “Right now, I just want to focus on perfume,” he said. “Maybe one day, a French Waltz body wash or some random sh*t like that. I don’t want to overdo it… I don’t even want to focus on, ‘Five years from now, we’re going to have f**king toe cream and hair moisturizer.’ Let me at least get people to smell the first fragrance first.” This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

"Ariana Grande reveals she had ‘a ton’ of lip filler and Botox, but stopped years ago"," Ariana Grande has revealed she’s taken a hiatus from lip fillers and Botox injections in recent years. Grande’s comments came during a video made for Vogue about her beauty secrets, during which she got candid — and emotional — about how her relationship with beauty has shifted over time. The singer and the actor has not previously disclosed undergoing any cosmetic procedures. Having grown up in the spotlight, and thus dealt with public scrutiny over her appearance from a young age, she said, “it’s really hard to know what’s worth hearing and not.” While applying makeup for the video, Grande, now aged 30, explained that she had often embellished her beauty looks with bigger hair or thicker eyeliner “as a disguise or something to hide behind,” but as she gets older she doesn’t “love that being the intention behind it anymore,” thinking of it “as self-expression and accentuating what is there” instead. Similarly, she continued, she used cosmetic procedures in the same way. “I had a ton of lip filler over the years, and Botox. I stopped in 2018 because I felt so — too much,” she said. “For a long time, beauty was about hiding for me and now I feel like maybe it’s not.” “I want to see my well-earned cry lines and smile lines,” she continued. “I hope my smile lines get deeper and deeper and I laugh more and more. Aging can be such a beautiful thing.” Though the prevalence of injectables and other treatments among famous faces is an open secret in Hollywood, it’s unusual for celebrities to be forthcoming about how they’ve altered their appearance — even with less invasive, more widely accepted procedures. Some stars, like Chrissy Teigen and Cindy Crawford, have been honest about cosmetic enhancements. This year, Blac Chyna has taken such candor even further, turning to social media to document the months-long process of dissolving facial fillers in her lips, cheeks and jaw. Grande is part of an increasing number of young patients who have undergone cosmetic enhancements. According to a survey from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 27% of patients receiving Botox injections in 2022 were age 34 or younger, up 6% from 2015. And 75% of facial plastic surgeons reported a rise in the number of patients under 30 seeking cosmetic surgery or injectables — a notable year-on-year increase, as a similar percentage of surgeons had also said they’d seen increased interest in 2021. Grande told Vogue that she hasn’t necessarily sworn off injectables or surgeries forever. “Now, might I get a face lift in 10 years? I might, yeah,” she said with a laugh. “But these are just thoughts we should be able to discuss. If we’re talking about beauty secrets… F*** it let’s put it all out there.”",Style
Tell-all book lifts the lid on troubled beauty brand Glossier," If the 1950s had red lipstick and pin curls, and the 1990s had brown gloss and “tightliner,” then the 2010s was all about fluffy brows and dewy skin. Between 2014 and 2019, many beauty enthusiasts’ preferences shifted: High coverage foundation was largely displaced by multi-step skincare routines, brow gel replaced heavy brow pomade and lips were delicately stained rather than boldly painted. The barely-there look was surprisingly big business, too. Glossier, a direct-to-consumer cosmetics company launched in 2014 by US businesswoman Emily Weiss, pioneered this new aesthetic. At Glossier, beauty marks were celebrated, freckles were lionized and makeup application became as free form as finger painting. The firm’s “skincare first, makeup second” mantra, fashion-forward millennial pink product design and early championing of new “It Girls,” like model Paloma Elsesser, catapulted it from cult favorite to industry mainstay. The company reported 600% growth between 2015 and 2016. And over the years, it has launched best-selling products such as Boy Brow, Milky Jelly Cleanser and Glossier “You” — the brand’s first and only fragrance, which reportedly sold at a rate of one every 43 seconds in 2022. Glossier also boasts significant star power. Beyoncé, Serena Williams, Michelle Obama and Reese Witherspoon have all been pictured wearing the makeup brand to red carpet events like the Oscars and The Grammys. Lila Moss, Sydney Sweeny, Gigi Hadid and SZA are also known to keep a product or two in their purse. In March 2019, Glossier was valued at $1 billion. But by 2021, the brand’s US sales were down 26% compared to the previous year. Last year, Glossier laid off a third of its corporate staff, citing certain “missteps” in overhiring. The tale of the company’s recent decline is the subject of “Glossy,” a new book by New York-based journalist Marisa Meltzer. “My guiding principle was to not simplify the story in any way,” Meltzer told CNN in a phone interview. “I wanted to show it in all its nuance and complexity.” The book attributes Glossier’s current woes to a series of stumbles: from lax hiring decisions, scaling at break-neck speed and Weiss’ alleged fixation with establishing Glossier as a tech company, to lackluster product launches and even entirely discontinued product lines (remember Glossier “Play”?). For Meltzer, the brand fell victim to something that often trips up companies leading the zeitgeist: an evolving landscape. Testimonies from anonymous Glossier employees also weave a familiar yarn of performative startups (where complimentary coconut waters were prioritized over competitive salaries), complete with allegations of racism and mistreatment. In 2020, the company and Emily Weiss apologized to former retail workers saying they had “failed to ensure that all voices are heard, and protected, within our internal community.” Glossier did not respond to CNN’s repeated request for comment about these historical allegations. But “Glossy” isn’t just a beauty brand biography — it’s a forensic cross-examination of an era-defining company and how it embodied a moment in wider culture. The book’s narrative addresses what it describes as the “cult” of the 2010s “girlboss,” symbolized by Weiss, as well as Nasty Gal’s Sophia Amoruso, Manrepeller’s Leandra Medine and Audrey Gelman of The Wing — all of whom were celebrated for their female entrepreneurship, before facing allegations (and, in some cases, lawsuits) from former employees complaining of workplace discrimination. In 2015, a spokesperson for Sophia Amoruso and Nasty Gal denied these allegations, but on Recho Omondi’s “Cutting Room Floor” podcast in 2021, Manrepeller’s Leandra Medine admitted she “sucked as a leader” and said complaints came down to her being “an immature a**hole.” Audrey Gelman stepped down as CEO of The Wing in June 2020 after penning an opinion piece titled “Where I got it wrong,” in which she states: “We prioritized business growth over cultural growth.” Meltzer unpacks the vaguely fetishized and infantilizing “girlboss” term without too much chastizing. “The phenomenon was a way for these women to be taken seriously, even if it was demeaning,” she told CNN in a video interview. “It was a vehicle for them to talk about themselves as businesswomen, rather than having to do the long profiles for women’s magazines talking about who they were dating.” “Glossy” is also a fascinating portrait of one of the most prolific female CEOs of the last decade. Weiss began as an ambitious and accomplished intern at Teen Vogue, who made a cameo on the early 2000’s reality TV series “The Hills.” In Meltzer’s unabashed account, Weiss is depicted as whip-smart, charismatic and driven, as well as somewhat guarded and self-conscious. “There’s no easy way to talk about the power dynamic of writing about someone, and they don’t necessarily want to be written about,” Meltzer told CNN. The book recounts how scheduled interviews became anodyne tours of retail locations or were forcibly switched to off-the-record last minute. “I wish she had been more open,” the author continued. “There was often a feeling of her trying to run out the clock until time was up, doing the absolute least.” CNN reached out to Weiss, via Glossier, about her participation in the book, but the company did not respond to requests for comment. By 2020, beauty’s needle had shifted again. Celebrities with Gen Z followings began crowding the market with wildly popular offerings — Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty or Hailey Bieber’s brand Rhode, for example — while young consumers became more interested in adorning their acne with yellow star-shaped stickers than masking zits with concealer. “Glossier defined the aesthetic of the 2010s” wrote Meltzer. “But as the ‘20s came about, it started to feel stale — all the sans serif font and #glossierpink.” But Meltzer didn’t set out to write a company post-mortem. Nor could she — Glossier still generates millions of dollars in monthly revenue, is stocked by beauty giant Sephora and operates a dozen brick-and-mortar stores around the world. When the company opened a new location in SoHo, New York this past February, crowds queued around the block. In January, the brand released its “You” scented deodorant, and just last month launched its second ever foundation with 32 shades to much fanfare (the first in 2014 debuted with just five). And although Weiss is no longer Glossier’s CEO, she continues to sit on the board as executive chairwoman. “Everything has a lifespan,” Meltzer said. “I think it was the end of the wide-eyed youth of the company. It’s not the Glossier of 2018 or 2019, it has to prove itself as relevant but it also has so much potential to be rediscovered by new markets, new generations.”",Style
Animatronic model of E.T.’s head expected to fetch up to $1 million at auction," An animatronic head of E.T., the beloved alien left behind on Earth in Steven Spielberg’s classic movie, is expected to sell for as much as $1 million at an auction held on December 14-17 in Beverly Hills, California and online. The animatronic model from “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” is part of a sale organized by Julien’s Auctions and Turner Classic Movies, which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. More than 1,000 props and memorabilia from some of the best-known sci-fi, fantasy, action and superhero movies and TV series will be available at the auction. Designed by the late Carlo Rambaldi, the model has some incredibly expressive moves. Its nostrils open and close, and its veins pulsate, while cables also allow for the movement of its eyes, lips, eyebrows, forehead and tongue. This model comes from Rambaldi’s own collection, as did the animatronic figure of E.T. sold by Julien’s Auctions last November for $2.56 million. His daughter, Daniela Rambaldi, recalls her father finding inspiration for E.T.’s expressive blue eyes from their family cat “Kikka,” the auction house said. The story of the homesick E.T. and his bond with Elliott, the boy who finds him, Spielberg’s 1982 movie won near-universal acclaim and was nominated for nine Oscars, of which it won four. Other artifacts from movie history are also up for sale, including a full Batman costume worn by Michael Keaton in “Batman Returns,” which has an estimate of up to $70,000, and a model of The Robot from the 1960s sci-fi series “Lost in Space.” This model is “one of the rarest artifacts from the era ever offered at auction which also is still functional,” the auction house said, since only two full-scale models of The Robot were made during the show’s run. It is expected to be sold for up to $500,000. Several items of Harry Potter memorabilia are for sale, too, including robes and the half-moon glasses worn by Richard Harris playing Albus Dumbledore in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” The robes - screen-matched for authenticity - and glasses are anticipated to reach up to $70,000 and $20,000, respectively. And for Marvel fans, props such as Captain America’s shield, complete with battle scars, from “Captain America: The First Avenger,” and a helmet worn by Robert Downey Jr. playing Iron Man in “Captain America: Civil War” are expected to sell for up to $70,000 and up to $40,000, respectively.",Style
How 2023 became the year of the lab-grown diamond," In New York, a stretch of 47th Street is known as the Diamond District for the countless gem shops and appraisers that occupy just about every storefront and office. Some 40 blocks south, Pandora recently brought to life a competing vision for how stones are made, bought and sold. During New York Fashion Week at the start of September, the jewelry retailer shut down the busy thoroughfare of Astor Place to host a splashy party it dubbed the “lab-grown diamond district,” attended by fashion insiders and stars like Pamela Anderson, the face of the brand’s latest campaign. Pandora was never a big player in the diamond category. It built its jewelry brand — one of the world’s biggest with nearly $4 billion in revenue last year — on charm bracelets that sell for under $100. But the surging popularity of lab-grown stones, which are structurally identical to mined diamonds but sell for a fraction of the price, has opened the doors for even relatively low-cost brands to offer serious bling. The company isn’t the only one seeing big sales from this category: Lab-grown diamond brand Brilliant Earth saw a 15.7 percent net sales increase in 2022, to $440 million. Dorsey, another exclusively lab-grown jewelry brand, sold over a million stones last year. Brands like these are changing how the jewelry business works: pieces typically fall into certain categories based on the types of materials used and the prices charged. Diamonds were the ultimate luxury signifier, their trade dominated by small, bespoke businesses or big brands like Tiffany and Cartier. Lab-grown stones have erased some of those distinctions. First developed in the 1980s, they are produced by exposing pure carbon to a large amount of heat and pressure in a metal cube, eventually creating a diamond. They are virtually indistinguishable from the traditional kind; realizing this, the diamond industry has invested in marketing designed to create two categories of stones in the minds of consumers. Those efforts haven’t worked, at least not for the most price-conscious consumers: a Tiffany tennis bracelet runs north of $20,000, while a bracelet containing similar, lab-grown carats from Brilliant Earth is $3,450. According to jewelry industry analyst Paul Zimnisky, sales of these man-made diamonds have increased from under $1 billion in 2016 to just under $12 billion in 2022. They represent just over 17% of the overall diamond market, according to diamond research firm Edahn Golan. The rate of growth is accelerating: Lab-grown sales shot up 38% from 2021 to 2022. The rapid rise of lab-grown stones is reverberating across the market. Pandora has raised its sales outlook twice this year, and its share price has more than doubled in the past year. Meanwhile, the world’s largest diamond producer and distributor De Beers is cutting prices of mined stones by as much as 40 percent due to falling demand for traditional diamonds. “For most people, a diamond is a diamond, and what you want is the wonderful sparkle and the beauty and the meaning that you can put into a diamond,” said Mary Carmen Gasco-Buisson, chief marketing officer at Pandora in an interview with the Business of Fashion. Many consumers plough the savings from buying a lab-grown diamond into more jewelry — a bigger engagement ring, for instance. The technology has also brought more shoppers into the market to buy pieces for themselves, rather than simply waiting for their partners to do so, said Dorsey founder Megan Strachan. To reach those shoppers, brands are adjusting their marketing approach. While diamonds have always been marketed as a luxury, those ads have often been geared towards men buying jewelry for their partners. Now, jewelers are marketing to a broader set of customers, particularly women shopping for fashion items. “The lab-grown diamond is not in competition with mined diamonds, it’s a complement to mined diamonds,” said Sayed Haider, COO, merchandising and operations at Diamond Nexus, which added a line of lab-grown diamonds to its offering earlier this year. “You have a beautiful engagement ring, but you want to get a matching set of earrings or a pendant … You can get all those aspirational pieces that you always wanted.” Though lab-grown engagement rings are growing in popularity, non-bridal jewelry is where many brands are seeing the most growth. Dorsey is focused on selling items like tennis necklaces and bracelets and vintage-inspired earrings. Strachan said the decision stemmed from a feeling that there was a bigger gap to fill in everyday jewelry. As well, she added, it allows for customers to become repeat purchasers, whereas “bridal is a single purchase.” “Every time I went into a jewelry store in the past, I always felt like I couldn’t afford it,” she said. “(Lab-grown) is democratizing something that was essentially reserved for the wealthy.” Dorsey, which was founded in 2019, saw its sales grow 600 percent from 2021 to 2022, and is on track to double sales again this year. It’s profitable, buoyed by word-of-mouth marketing, particularly among influencers who are finding and talking about the product on their own. Marketing around man-made diamonds often performs double duty, both selling the individual item and countering the idea that greater accessibility equates with subpar quality. Dorsey photographs its products in editorial-like spreads that would look at home in the pages of Vogue, marketing the jewelry like fashion, said Strachan. The brand’s Instagram feed is filled with sleek images of well-dressed women, including model Bella Hadid and Justin and Hailey Bieber wearing its necklaces. “The same way that we choose our shoes, we choose our jewelry, and I felt like that’s been missed (in marketing),” said Strachan. Pandora’s fall campaign highlighted the accessibility aspect of lab-grown stones with its tagline, “Diamonds for All,” but its fashion week event, and the hiring of stars like Anderson and model Precious Lee, shows how it too is repositioning its brand. Earlier this month, the brand unveiled a partnership with the British Fashion Council and will serve as a sponsor of The British Fashion Awards in December. Legacy jewelry brands have been slow to embrace their new competition. Even when De Beers started to dip into the space with its sub-brand Lightbox brand  in 2018, chief executive Bruce Cleaver positioned it as “affordable fashion jewelry that may not be forever, but is perfect for right now,” in a statement. Today, more high-end companies are beginning to inch into the lab-grown market. This month, LVMH-owned jeweler Fred has been showing a new collection featuring man-made stones to high-net-worth clients to test the product with wealthy shoppers. To differentiate from the brand’s mined offering, the new assortment of diamonds are blue. It’s become a trend legacy jewelry houses can’t ignore: According to Zimnisky, sales of lab-grown stones are likely to continue growing at an annual double-digit percentage rate in the next few years. “What started as a skepticism, or a question of if it will be an embarrassment, now carries a sense of pride,” said Amish Shah, the founder of lab-grown jewelry brand J’evar. “It’s the diamond of the future.” Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN",Style
Most expensive Ferrari ever auctioned fetches $51.7 million," A 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO has sold for $51.705 million, becoming the most expensive car from the Italian manufacturer ever sold at auction. The record-breaking sale took place at Sotheby’s in New York on Monday as the car was offered publicly for the first time in 38 years. Gord Duff, RM Sotheby’s Global Head of Auctions, said the sale “highlights the unparalleled sta﻿ture of this Ferrari as one of the world’s most desirable objects.” “This transaction adds a new chapter to a vehicle with an unmatched legacy,” Duff said in a press release. “Now, it ranks among the most expensive cars sold at auction, a true testament to its singular place in history,” he added. Only 39 examples of the 250 GTO were built by the legendary Italian marque between 1962 and 1964, and it’s extremely rare for an owner to part with one at any price. This example, chassis number 3765, is one of only 34 built with Tipo 1962 coachwork, and the only one of these raced by the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, featuring in races such as the Le Mans 24 Hours. “Claiming unique build provenance and a remarkable in-period racing pedigree, this spectacular GTO is among the model’s most singular examples,” the auction house wrote in the listing, which billed the sale as “an extraordinary chance to acquire the Holy Grail of the sports car pantheon, one that should be relished for the opportunity it is.” Its rarity means it has featured in several Ferrari-focused magazines over the decades, and Sotheby’s suggests that “the public availability of such a singular GTO may never repeat itself within our lifetime.” While 3765 is now the most expensive Ferrari ever to sell at auction, another 250 GTO holds the record for most expensive Ferrari ever sold. Renowned car collector David MacNeil, founder and CEO of automotive floor-mat company WeatherTech, bought chassis number 4153 GT for $70 million in 2018. At the time, James Knight, group motoring chairman at UK auction house Bonhams, likened 250 GTOs to some of the most exclusive artworks in the world. “The Ferrari 250 GTO is the motoring market’s equivalent of Van Gogh’s ‘Sunflowers’ and a talisman for any top-end collection,” said Knight. “And the GTO that recently sold is one of the best five extant.",Style
"Rare Titanic menu shedding light on life aboard sells for over $100,000"," A rare first-class menu from the Titanic sold for £83,000 ($102,000) on Saturday as part of an auction of memorabilia associated with the doomed ocean liner. Heavily water-stained, with some of the lettering partly erased, the menu likely ended up in the North Atlantic for a time when the Titanic sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, British auction house Henry Aldridge and Son Ltd. said in the lot description. The ultimately salvaged menu details the first dinner on board after the Titanic set sail from Queenstown, Belfast and reveals the opulence that the ship’s first-class passengers would have experienced. Dinner options on that night of April 11 included oysters, sirloin of beef with horseradish cream and pureed parsnips, with desserts including apricot Bordaloue — a type of tart — and Victoria pudding. There seem to be no other surviving examples of the first-class menu for that specific night, the auction house found after consulting museums with Titanic collections and speaking to leading memorabilia collectors. Other items in the auction offer a fleeting glimpse into the lives of the 2,223 passengers and crew on board the Titanic, of whom just 706 survived. A tartan blanket used by one of those survivors to stay warm in a lifeboat was hailed by the auction house as “one of the rarest three dimensional objects we have seen,” and sold for £96,000 ($117,000). Previously, the blanket belonged to Frederick Toppin, who, in his capacity as Assistant General Manager in New York of the company that owned the Titanic, had acquired it at a New York pier when he met rescued passengers coming ashore, the auction house said prior to Saturday’s sale. But 1,517 of those on board the Titanic did not survive, and a pocket watch belonging to Sinai Kantor, a Russian immigrant traveling to the United States in second class, marks the moment he entered the water and later died. It fetched £97,000 ($119,000) to become the most expensive lot sold at Saturday’s auction. Other items on sale included a facing slip, used to mark bundles of mail, that highlighted the fate of the postal clerks aboard, all of whom died attempting to haul mail sacks to the ship’s upper decks to try to save them from flooding, the auction house added.",Style
‘Looty’: How a dog stolen from China sparked a British luxury craze," In an 1861 painting commissioned by the British monarch Queen Victoria, a brown and white Pekingese sits demurely on a cushion in front of a Japanese vase, gazing into the distance. Admired for her adorably smushed snout and leonine features, she was a new addition to the queen’s canine entourage — a breed of toy dog, never previously seen in Great Britain, that quickly became one of the most sought-after luxury items among the upper classes. But her gentle demeanor belied a brutal past. A year before German artist Frederick William Keyl completed the painting, Anglo-French forces had stormed Beijing’s Old Summer Palace, razing the 860-acre “Garden of Perfect Brightness” to rubble. Legend has it that as the Xianfeng Emperor and his court fled the invaders, an elderly aunt chose to stay, committing suicide in her quarters surrounded by a faithful litter of Pekingese puppies. The dogs were scooped up by soldiers and spirited away to the West, along with thousands of other looted treasures. This origin story may be — at least in part — apocryphal. But the Pekingese in the painting was undoubtedly brought to Britain by Captain John Dunne of the 99th Regiment, which participated in the sacking of the palace on orders to avenge the killing of several British envoys by China’s then-ruling Qing dynasty government. “People say it is the most perfect little beauty they ever saw,” he wrote of the dog in his journal. Dunne gifted her to the queen, and the animal was given a new name: Looty. Looty’s arrival, along with that of other Pekingese subsequently brought to or bred on British shores, sparked a frenzy among high society women that continued long after Victoria’s death. (Between 1914 and 1962, the Pekingese was the most popular toy breed in Britain, with 5,809 of the dogs registered by the country’s Kennel Club at the height of the craze in 1950.) In the Edwardian era of the early 1900s, one lord is said to have spent “as much as £3,000” — more than £300,000 ($365,000) in today’s money — for “a few” dogs, according to the 1954 book “Pekingese Scrapbook.” Among the British, the dogs were coveted as souvenirs of “Old China” — a romanticized, mystical vision of a then-fading imperial nation that, weakened by the Opium Wars, collapsed in 1911 and was replaced by a Chinese republic. As such, a Pekingese’s “stolen” status was part of its cachet. Writing in the Journal of British Studies in 2006, Sarah Cheang, a design historian at the UK’s Royal College of Art, said the dogs were advertised as having been “smuggled” out of China and associated with sensational tales of thievery by palace servants. Aficionados also gave them what Cheang described as stereotypically “oriental” traits, for instance claiming they disliked thunderstorms because of trauma from tropical typhoons, or suggesting that the tawny “pekes” — as the breed is often referred to — refused to mate with dogs of other colors due to being “conscious that yellow was the sacred color of the Chinese emperor.” (A 1912 newspaper story, meanwhile, suggested that Looty had been a “lonely” creature at Buckingham Palace, ostracized by the queen’s other dogs who took exception to her “Oriental habits and appearance.” In another questionable account, author Annie Coath Dixey claimed that imperial puppies were “suckled by the waiting-women of the court in place of their own superfluous girl babes which were drowned.”) According to Cheang, Pekingese ownership became an expression of “colonial nostalgia” through which women could “constitute themselves and the Pekingese dogs both as the rightful inheritors of colonial wealth,” she wrote, adding: “Like living imperial heirlooms, they conferred ‘high-born’ status upon their mistresses.” Owners founded breeding clubs and organized exclusive events, like a Pekingese garden party held at a wealthy woman’s London home in 1901. The party’s guests included the Chinese ambassador and pekes from across Britain that sat tethered on the lawn as their owners socialized over tea. The breed’s rise in popularity was part of a wider appropriation of Chinese (and other Asian) arts and products, or “Chinoiserie.” Like in Queen Victoria’s painting of Looty, artists frequently depicted the dogs alongside East Asian objects or donning imperial-style robes to recreate Imperial China, Cheang told CNN in a phone interview. “It was a combination of China fantasy and nostalgia,” she added, explaining that Pekingese’s royal associations were strengthened by the fact that imperial figures like the Empress Dowager Cixi — who ruled for nearly 50 years, and was often compared to Queen Victoria — had also owned the dogs. Cixi, a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor who bore his only son before becoming de facto leader upon his death (less than a year after the Old Summer Palace was ransacked), is perhaps China’s most influential Pekingese owner. According to a book published by Beijing’s Palace Museum, the empress kept more than 1,000 dogs, many of which were Pekingese, in imperial kennels in the Forbidden City. Allowed to roam free in the palace gardens, these Pekingese were served by four designated eunuchs who would be severely punished if any mishaps befell them, the museum’s publication added. Cixi’s favorite, Hai Lung (or “sea otter”), followed her wherever she went, and was considered “next in importance to the Empress herself,” the empresses’ lady-in-waiting Princess Der Ling said, according to author Rumer Godden’s “The Butterfly Lions,” a 1978 book on the breed’s history. “Her Majesty adored the little brute. He had a special eunuch to wait on him and slept in a large basket, big enough for a baby,” Princess Der Ling is quoted as saying, adding that the dog ate special meals of chopped liver, rice and gravy which were personally inspected by Cixi. “If anything had ever happened to that dog it would have upset the entire routine of the court!” When Cixi was forced to flee Beijing during the anti-imperialist Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the 20th century, she took a batch of Pekingese dogs with her on sedan chairs, according to the Palace Museum, and allegedly ordered the rest to be executed so that no more would be looted and end up in foreigners’ hands. While the breed’s exact origins are unknown, records suggest Pekingese — or dogs resembling them — were imperial pets as far back as the Tang dynasty, more than 1,100 years ago. Bred to look like small lions, a symbol of strength and protection in Buddhism, they were often owned by the wealthy. Chinese royals were even known to carry smaller specimens in the sleeves of their robes. But by the end of the 20th century, pekes had become less popular in Britain due to changing tastes, according to the Kennel Club’s library and collections manager, Ciara Farrell. “They were considered (symbols of) luxury but also stuffy and old-fashioned,” she said in a phone interview. “From the 1970s onwards, more women were entering the workforce. People were looking for pets that didn’t require so much (grooming) work.” The decline accompanied growing familiarity with modern China, meaning that “by the time you get to the 1990s, it was difficult to maintain a fantasy of China,” Cheang said, adding: “Everybody is aware of what Communist China looks like. The dog no longer fits.” Looty died in the Spring of 1872. Unlike many of Queen Victoria’s dogs, she was buried in an unmarked grave at Windsor Castle, the whereabouts of which remains unknown. Yet her journey and the darker side of what it represents — the trauma of British imperialism and cultural appropriation — remains relevant to this day. This summer, the 1861 painting of Looty was displayed in an exhibition about 19th-century China at the British Museum in London that brought some of these issues to the fore. The exhibition fell under scrutiny for using a Chinese translator’s work without credit, and was the subject of a Chinese state media campaign demanding the repatriation of Chinese artifacts. One Chinese art blog also criticized the museum’s inclusion of the Looty painting as an attempt to make a section of the exhibition about  the Old Summer Palace’s destruction appear “cuter.” Others, though, have looked to reclaim Looty’s narrative. Her story was revived in “Looty Goes to Heaven,” a 2022 speculative novel by Amy Ching-Yan Lam, while a recent NFT art project, which creates digital versions of museum items stolen by European colonizers, is also named after her. Pekes may be out of fashion, but Looty lives on.",Style
‘Bleu Royal’ diamond fetches almost $44 million at auction," The largest internally flawless fancy vivid blue diamond ever put up for auction sold for a staggering $43.8 million at a Christie’s sale of rare jewels in Geneva on Tuesday, the auctioneer said. The vivid blue diamond, known as “Bleu Royal” and set in a ring, is among the rarest ever to be unearthed. At 17.6 carats, the diamond had an estimated value of up to $50 million prior to the sale. “The stone made almost $44 million,” said Rahul Kadakia, Christie’s international head of jewelry. “It’s a huge amount of money given what’s going on in the world today.” Max Fawcett, head of Christie’s jewelry department in Geneva, said the diamond was unique because of its a deep rich blue color and its unmodified pear brilliant shape. “It really ticked all the boxes, which is why we managed to excite collectors all around the world, all the way from the Far East, also to America,” he said. “We’re extremely delighted with the result.” At its auction on Tuesday, Christie’s sold dozens of rare jewelry pieces worth a combined total of more than $77 million. “It’s clear that the market is still very strong in certain areas,” Fawcett said. “Colored stones performed extremely well, as did signed jewelry… There’s a great market out there for rare things, and there are still collectors looking for the very best.” In a separate sale on Monday, Christie’s sold a Rolex wristwatch worn by Marlon Brando in the 1979 movie “Apocalypse Now” for more than 4.5 million Swiss francs ($4.99 million). The actor had engraved his signature on the back to avoid having it swapped accidentally during shooting. Two years ago, that same watch sold at auction for 2 million Swiss francs.",Style
"‘My beliefs haven’t changed’: From social housing to skyscrapers, architect Moshe Safdie is still an idealist"," There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city’s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal “skypark” and the world’s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn’t even stay there. “It’s too noisy,” said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. “I’m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.” Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (“I had a British mother,” he explained, “so I’m a sucker for scones and tea.”) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. “It wasn’t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,” he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state’s government in the mid-2000s. “They didn’t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic. “When we made the submission, I said, ‘Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.’ And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, ‘It’s a mystery what makes that happen.’” The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts. “That kind of stuff, you can’t quite plan for or design – it just happens,” he said of the building’s success. “But I’m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.” Safdie’s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall. Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect’s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he’s in Singapore. “I was concerned about how the plants were doing,” he said. “But I was relieved to see they’re thriving.” The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island’s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges – a recurring theme in Safdie’s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan “horizontal skyscraper” (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers. Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands’ second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower – though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn’t, in his words, “screw around” with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming “sort of an exclamation mark,” he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: “Boooom… boom.” At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect’s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, “If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.” He said he felt it was “time to document things.” Published this week, “If Walls Could Speak” serves as a reminder that much of Safdie’s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits – museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities. Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal’s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie’s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale “Habitats” around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran’s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie’s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment – that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors – defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa’s Mount Carmel and then at his family’s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha’i Gardens “almost functioned as my backyard,” he writes in “If Walls Could Speak.” One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture – and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city’s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, “A Case for City Living,” outlining his vision for a flexible housing “system” that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie’s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect’s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates. Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event’s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents’ views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground. Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments – made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three “clusters.” It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie’s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century’s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had “outdone” the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project “was a game changer,” he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked “gentle fun” at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms. “It’s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,” Safdie mused. “But that’s been true of my career.” To define Safdie’s career by either his breakout success or the “megascale” projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between. In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto’s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country’s most treasured art. Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his “Habitats” in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao – in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing – a series of 16-story “mini blocks” connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie’s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases – and throughout Safdie’s career – ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. “The belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture – from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,” he said. “And they haven’t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.” “I think, without bragging, there’s been consistency,” he added. “In fact, you could say I’ve not been dynamic enough, but I’ve been pretty consistent.” There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan’s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987’s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis). But Safdie’s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn’t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream – something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed “for everyone a garden” in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and “living walls” are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments. Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between “significant plant life” and “sorry shrubs.” So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. “The idea of green buildings is a battle cry – everyone is for it,” he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. “There’s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there’s no preparation for the earth, there’s no depth – it’s a fantasy.” Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia. “For a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),” Safdie said. “But now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor – not in China, because they’ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.” Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he “never would have imagined” how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. “Programs change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,” the architect added. But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? “My daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,” the architect said. “I disagree with her.” Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving “regimes you’re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,” he noted. “Take the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,” he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton’s lounge. “On the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote ‘gaming’ – that’s a nice word for it, but ‘gambling’ is the reality – is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money. “But, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that… could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me. “That’s compromise,” he concluded. “But the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don’t know how you can be an architect.” “If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,” published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.",Style
How this dream-like photo challenges notions of the male gaze," A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph’s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li’s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, “The Smothering Dream,” suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema’s 1888 work “The Roses of Heliogabalus,” in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li’s modern take — shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture — is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. “I made this very pink and kitsch dream,” she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. “But underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It’s a fantasy of love and eroticism… smothering these men I desire.” Shot in 2022, “The Smothering Dream” was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called “A Quiet Gaze.” It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li’s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled “My Tinder Boys”). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman’s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos — fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. “Instead of being a passive, ‘looked-at’ thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,” said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: “I’m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.” Li, who was born in China’s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. “As a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.” Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become “less binary.” She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into “Paintings, Dreams and Love,” an ongoing project to which “The Smothering Dream” belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled “After the Dream,” hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli’s 1781 “The Nightmare,” showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and “The Death of Actaeon,” Renaissance painter Titian’s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans’ goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li’s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window. But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. “Some of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,” she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. “Now you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want… it’s something very different, it’s not (just) a physical thing, it’s a digital thing. “There’s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it… the internet (means) we’re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.”",Style
Life in limbo: Photographer documents ‘Kafka-esque’ migrant experience," Photographer Felipe Romero Beltrán’s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another’s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltrán befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andalucía. Published in his new book “Dialect,” the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltrán called a “Kafka-esque” system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. “At the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,” Beltrán said on a video call from Madrid. “But of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.” Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andalucía, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn’t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in “Dialect,” one of Beltrán’s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. “He did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,” Elhafidi wrote. “The boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.” According to Beltrán, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain — some of which were run by Beltrán. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltrán looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain’s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltrán toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants’ abundant free time. “There was an activity around taking the images — it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,” Beltrán recalled. “Everyone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.” When Beltrán began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and — even as a college-educated Spanish speaker — also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled “Recital” in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. “They weren’t understanding a word,” he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men’s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of “Dialect” — whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges — are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (“Right to effective judicial protection” reads the text on one frame; another says, “Authorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities”). “These legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,” said Beltrán, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. “It becomes almost like translation work — translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.” The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. “You can’t talk with anyone,” Beltrán added. “You can’t ask, ‘Who is the law?’ or ‘Who is the state?’ You don’t have anyone to approach. You don’t have any tools to make a living… The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).” Describing the group as “just young people trying to figure out what to do with life,” the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants’ experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltrán completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some — including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book’s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: “It took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother’s tears… I got it,” he wrote. “I got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.” “They’re building their lives,” Beltrán said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. “Fortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.” “Dialect,” published by Loose Joints, is available now.",Style
Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in China," A young man stands grinning in Beijing’s Forbidden City. It’s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world’s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. “The changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn’t have noticed,” he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong. He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign — a series of failed industrialization policies — before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader’s death, Liu said, “suddenly, people’s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.” It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history — politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a “Democracy Wall” in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu’s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was “missing.” He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China “moving out of the shadow of Mao,” he said. In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China’s transformative economic reforms with his “Open Door” policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of “ganbei” (cheers). He then thought to himself, “Now where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?” He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. “I remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: ‘It tastes so-so’” said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace’s picturesque pavilions in the background. The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. “As a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People’s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,” he said, adding: “But I didn’t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.” The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu’s photography book “China after Mao,” a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book “Liu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.” The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country’s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu’s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign — ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks — the image stands in stark contrast to today’s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping’s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West. “I realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,” Liu said. “Especially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people’s collective memory. “Even though this memory keeps being re-edited… the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people’s minds.” Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing’s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.",Style
This photo of male intimacy in 1980s India was more subversive than it seems," To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi’s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. “Men holding hands or lying in each other’s laps is not an issue — it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they’re usually just hanging out,” he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: “I was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.” Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the “repressive atmosphere” of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today — and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an “unnatural offense” — the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi’s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument’s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot. Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. “I passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,” he said. “You just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.” The image forms part of the photographer’s series “Exiles,” which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India’s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about “outing” his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a “constructed documentary” approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. “There was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,” he said of the India Gate shoot. “And there were other photos that were (more suggestive)… So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.” The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used — and the art of photography itself. “It wasn’t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,” he said, adding: “Then I tried to explain the process.” Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still “a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.” Now among India’s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York’s Christopher Street that captured the city’s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although “Exiles” presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta’s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced “a lot of hostility” at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. “I couldn’t make gay work, and I couldn’t make gay work about India, especially,” he said. “There was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, ‘I’m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon — we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.’” New York’s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series’ place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. “It didn’t have any impact when it was first shown,” Gupta said of its debut.  “I think it was too early.” By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta’s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that “Exiles” is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too. Although the country’s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (“Those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening — or maybe happening less,” he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. “I think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,” Gupta said. “People think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don’t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.” This is a message reflected in the photographer’s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. “It just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.” “Exiles” is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now.",Style
How this photographer makes sublime landscapes of the American West," The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus. The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. “(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,” he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, “Time’s Arrow,” this month), he began a new career from scratch. “While the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.” Wu’s imagery takes a classic photographer’s combination — light and landscape — and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning. The artist’s 2018 photo book “Lux Noctis” is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled “An Irresistible Force,” outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby’s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). “I couldn’t have dreamed of where I am now,” Wu said. “I just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.” Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn’t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” which featured Wyoming’s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh). The film’s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. “(It’s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,” he said. He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails. Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. “I flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,” he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially. Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a “massive” eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he’s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. “I’m a lot less anxious now, because I’ve crashed a number of drones,” he said. “And in the end, they’re just tools.” After developing series of still images such as “Lux Noctis” and “Aeroglyphs,” which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. “These (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal — they were just things that I did for love out of love,” he said. “I couldn’t license them, I couldn’t print them… and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.” But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first “non-fungible token”  on the marketplace Foundation two months later — an “aeroglyph” of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled “Aeroglyph Variations,” which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. “It’s very much a hybrid medium, and so I’d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,” he said. “Am I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?” Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. “A lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly — that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,” he said. “But I’m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I’m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.”",Style
What this playful photo reveals about Hong Kong’s infamous ‘Walled City’," It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong’s humidity – already oppressive – was intensified in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground. Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave’s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas. He wasn’t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces “wasn’t always so clear,” Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. “Once you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it’s cooler, there’s a breeze.” Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites. “No one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,” said Girard. On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard’s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had “settled into this face-off with me.” In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she’s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat. “I thought (the image) captured the kids’ indifference to the potential danger … of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,” said Girard, adding: “It was just quite an average day up on (there).” The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said. “It wasn’t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone — which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.” Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport. At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes. “This strange, vertical village wasn’t really supposed to exist,” said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced. “That allowed it to become something you couldn’t have dreamed up,” Girard added. Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry. But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the “thriving” city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, “very out of date.” “It might have been true at one time,” he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. “You quickly realize that it’s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.” Girard was determined to demystify the so-called “City of Darkness,” particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999. Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment — similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits. “The only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,” said Girard. When it came to capturing people’s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use “a more even-handed approach,” he added. Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family’s grocery store, and a barber curling a client’s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (“there was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,” he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments. His guiding principle, Girard said, was “to try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.” When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a “revisited” edition of their book that explored the city’s legacy in popular culture — including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as “Call of Duty: Black Ops” and “Batman Begins.” “The Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don’t apply,” said Girard. There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a “dystopia” to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard. “The limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,” Girard added. The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition. Inside the building, Girard’s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community — immortalized by photographers like Girard — lingers. Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. “It still continues to fascinate,” he said. “And that’s wonderful.”",Style
Skiplagging: Why some flyers love it and why airlines hate it," How creative would you get to shave $500 off a flight? For those kinds of savings, some flyers engage in the practice known as skiplagging. Also called hidden-city ticketing or throwaway ticketing, it’s a way some travelers work around an often-counterintuitive airline booking system, shaving money off the price of their trip. Sometimes, airlines actually charge more for a direct flight than they do for a flight with one or more connecting cities. Typically, a skiplagger books a less expensive flight that has two or more legs rather than buy the more costly direct flight. But it’s a connecting city – not the final city of the flight – that has been the skiplagger’s covert destination along. The skiplagger exits the airport at the connecting city. Airlines don’t like the tactic, to put it mildly. And flyers who do it could face penalties from carriers. Yet some passengers are willing to gamble. Amanda, a mother who works in marketing in Texas, flies often and is a somewhat recent convert to the practice. She agreed to talk about her skiplagging experiences if CNN Travel published only her first name. Amanda says she has used hidden city ticketing about 10 times in the past couple of years and estimates she’s saved somewhere from $3,000 to $4,000. “I think I started around two years ago after, you know, the pandemic. I think in 2021, the companies started to push the prices higher,” Amanda said. By skiplagging, “I pay much less, and I’m doing it constantly.” Amanda said she normally does it on international flights. So far, the airlines do not appear to have detected Amanda’s skiplagging ways. Is she worried about getting caught down the line? “I hope I don’t because it helps me a lot,” she said. “I’m planning to do it again [at] the end of this month” for an international flight. To be clear, skiplagging isn’t a criminal offense. “You’re not going to go to jail,” said Scott Keyes, founder of travel site Going. “It is something that is against the airline’s contract of carriage, which means that they see it as a violation of the terms and conditions that you agree to when you purchase your flight.” And while airlines can’t have violators put in the slammer, Keyes said they can try to slam skiplaggers – especially audacious, repeat offenders – with some tough disincentives, including a loss of frequent flyer miles or even bans from flying on the airline. Skiplagging isn’t new. “In fact, travel agents have used it as a tool to save money for customers for many years,” said Phil Dengler, co-founder of online travel advice site The Vacationer, in an email interview. Dengler said the website Skiplagged.com has increased awareness of the practice in the last decade. “The term ‘skiplagging’ has slowly replaced ‘hidden-city ticketing’ as the most commonly used term for the practice.” Kathleen Bangs, a former airline pilot and a spokesperson for FlightAware, said in an email interview that “it can be thought of as the modern-day equivalent of ghosting an airline flight, because the carrier expects you in the seat you’ve purchased, but you never show up.” The practice doesn’t exist on nonstop flights, Bangs said, laying out a scenario: “Suppose I want to fly from Minneapolis to Miami, and the fare is $500. Then I discovered that if I book the flight from Minneapolis to Jacksonville, Florida, with a stop or a connection in Miami, the fare is only $350. “In that case, I could book a one-way flight only, take just carry-on bags, and simply never board the Miami-Jacksonville leg of the itinerary and voila – I’m in Miami - where I wanted to be in the first place, and saved $150 in the process.” Airlines despise the practice. Dengler laid out a couple of reasons why. “Airlines do not like skiplagging because it costs them money. Flights with connections are generally cheaper than nonstop flights because airlines have a lower price ceiling for them,” he said. “Skipping the final leg ensures the flight will have an empty seat that the airline could have otherwise sold for more money to someone looking to fly nonstop. While the plane will be a bit lighter, airlines have decided any fuel savings do not offset the price of the lost ticket sale. “Additionally, your airline knows you were on the first flight and are at the airport. The gate agents may call your name out or slightly delay closing the doors. Besides losing money, it creates additional stress for airline staff.” Keyes said the hub-and-spoke airlines – the carriers that operate service to many destinations in all directions out of their hub airports – tend to be the most affected, and therefore usually the most concerned, by skiplagging. CNN Travel reached out to seven major airlines with such operations for comment: American, Delta and United in the United States as well as Air Canada, British Airways, Emirates (Dubai) and Lufthansa (Germany). Only American had any formal comment, in which it said: “The practice of hidden city ticketing is prohibited by American’s Conditions of Carriage and agency agreements. … If a customer knowingly or unknowingly purchases a ticket and doesn’t fly all of the segments in their itinerary, it can lead to operational issues with checked bags and prevent other customers from booking a seat when they may have an urgent need to travel. Intentionally creating an empty seat that could have been used by another customer or team member is an all-around bad outcome.” Air Canada, Delta and United responded and pointed to their contracts of carriage. Emirates had no comment, and British Airways and Lufthansa did not respond. The US Department of Transportation, which has been advocating for passenger rights after cancellation meltdowns in recent years, did not address skiplagging specifically when asked for comment, simply stating: “As we’ve shown through our enforcement, public awareness efforts, and regulatory actions, protecting consumers is one of the highest priorities of the Department. We will continue to examine areas of concern and respond as warranted.” Keyes said the airlines have a delicate balancing act trying to crack down on it. “They’re worried if they make … too large an example of it, if they highlight it too much, that it actually could backfire and cause more people to become aware of this way that some people are saving money on flights now.” Keyes said he has skiplagged a couple of times himself, pointing to The New York Times ethicist, who did a column on the practice. Dengler strikes a cautionary note about swimming in these waters. “While skiplagging is one way to save money on flights, I do not recommend doing it in most situations. There is just too much hassle and stress. While you can probably get away with it if you do it very infrequently, there is a real risk your airline takes away your miles, forces you to pay a fare difference, and temporarily bans you.” Back in Texas, Amanda is ready to take the risks because it’s the only way she can afford to fly out of the country as often as she needs to.  Tickets are now “three, sometimes five times, higher than two or three years ago. So it’s impossible sometimes, you know, to travel anymore.”",Travel
What causes travel constipation and how to fix it," Once you’re finally on vacation, it’s no fun when suddenly not being able to poop keeps you from enjoying your trip. This predicament is known as travel constipation, when people who typically don’t have digestive problems at home develop “the characteristic symptoms of constipation” while they’re traveling, said Dr. Darren Brenner, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine and surgery at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois. These symptoms can include “less frequent stools, harder stools, more straining and greater sensations of incomplete evacuation,” he added. Some people experience constipation on some trips, while others do every time they travel. Addressing the problem may require a multipronged approach since constipation, in general, is a multi-symptom problem, said Dr. William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology and nutritional sciences at Michigan Medicine. Here are some of the most common causes of travel constipation and what you can do about them. Some digestive health experts have theorized that being in a different time zone or following a new schedule during travel could contribute to travel constipation by throwing off your circadian rhythm — physical, mental and behavioral changes that happen over a 24-hour cycle. “Most normal people will move their bowels in the morning after waking,” Chey said. As people wake up and especially after a meal, the body releases different hormones that help the bowel to contract. There hasn’t been enough research to conclude whether there’s any way to prevent this effect on your circadian rhythm or how long it lasts, Brenner said, since there’s not much you can do to counteract a different time zone. Your mode of travel can also affect your regularity for multiple reasons. Whether you drive, take a train or bus, or fly, being sedentary for a long time can have a negative effect since movement is necessary for pooping regularly. And if you’re lounging around a lot on your vacation, suddenly being sedentary will not help your digestive system move much at all. Flying can also make you feel bloated because of the drop in atmospheric pressure as your altitude increases, Chey said. “A gas will expand or contract based upon the atmospheric pressure of the airplane cabin,” he added. “As you start to ascend, go way up in the air, the air in your bowels will expand, and it’s going to make you feel really bloated.” To alleviate constipation from sedentariness, “learn and engage in some simple exercises with your arms and legs during the course of the flight, and maintain some level of physical activity,” Chey said. Try walking to some destinations instead of driving or doing an exercise routine in your hotel room. And to prevent flight bloating, avoid drinking fizzy beverages and eating foods you know typically bloat you. What can also help is chewing your food adequately and slowly and drinking slowly. Don’t chew gum or suck on hard candy since those actions can make you swallow more air than necessary, Chey said. One supplement Chey likes is enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules, which can alleviate discomfort from bloating. Changes in eating habits “can significantly alter your gut microbiome,” Brenner said. That “may play a role in the development of constipation as well.” These changes typically include trying lots of new foods, eating fast food during a long road trip or eating more indulgent meals than you typically would since you are, after all, on vacation, experts said. And when you’re indulging, hydration levels can also take a hit. Dehydration can also result from excess alcohol consumption or from the dry air on planes, experts said. “Going on vacation should not be viewed as a license to eating as much as you want and whatever you want,” Chey said. “Some people can get away with that, but most people actually can’t.” However, there are some things you can do to enjoy different cuisines on your trip and support your digestive health. In addition to ensuring you stay hydrated, include some fibrous fruits and vegetables — think pears, apples, kale or broccoli — in your daily food intake. For road trips and flights, you could pack your own healthier snacks and meals, Chey suggested. Another influential factor is when people “become more self-conscious about moving their bowels when they’re outside of their own home,” Chey said. “People tend to hold it, which can make it a lot harder to move your bowels when it’s more socially convenient.” Stress and anxiety around travel itself can also affect your ability to move your bowels, he added. What can help is doing activities that help your mind feel relaxed rather than rushed, Chey said. Diaphragmatic breathing, also called belly breathing, could be a valuable tool to learn, Chey said. “When you take a deep breath in, you really focus on expanding your belly button and then breathe out. Engaging in diaphragmatic breathing has been shown to relieve anxiety and also even reduce your heart rate.” If adjusting any of these lifestyle factors doesn’t work for you, you could talk with your doctor about trying laxatives, experts said. Some natural laxatives that can help include high-fiber fruits such as kiwis, mangoes and prunes, experts said. Starting your trip by taking a fiber supplement or over-the-counter laxative — such as magnesium oxide, bisacodyl, psyllium or polyethylene glycol 3350 — with a glass of water or juice could help you prevent constipation and ease into things, experts said, rather than responding to discomfort. Just don’t take more than the product’s instructions recommend, lest you hog that airplane bathroom.",Travel
First-ever World of Frozen opens at Hong Kong Disneyland," Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Sven have a new home on a subtropical island in Asia. World of Frozen, Disney’s first-ever themed land dedicated to the “Frozen” media franchise, opened at Hong Kong Disneyland on November 20. The new land at the park on Hong Kong’s Lantau Island brings the fictional kingdom of Arendelle to life, including several elements from key scenes in the hit movies such as the North Mountain, Elsa’s Ice Palace, the snowflake-topped ice fountain and the clock tower where Anna and Prince Hans sing “Love is An Open Door” in the first “Frozen” movie. “The ‘Frozen’ franchise is one of the most successful in Disney history and it’s a testament to the power of great storytelling,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in Hong Kong at a November 16 event to commemorate World of Frozen’s opening. Disney Imagineers spent more than three years working on the concept and design of the new attraction. The franchise itself is just 10 years old, with the first “Frozen” movie coming out in 2013, followed by “Frozen II” in 2019, as well as several short films and TV shows. The company announced in September that it will be doubling its investment in its Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment, with $60 billion spending planned in the next decade. While Disney is facing revenue challenges elsewhere, its international theme parks are thriving, with Iger saying in August that parks in Asia are doing “exceptionally well.” In the new World of Frozen in Hong Kong, cast members playing Elsa, Anna and Kristoff will walk around interacting with guests, a departure from other lands where princesses and other characters are largely available only for photo opportunities. And instead of scheduled shows, a band will wander intermittently throughout World of Frozen playing music. Hong Kong’s World of Frozen also includes two rides: Wandering Oaken’s Sliding Sleighs, a high-speed roller coaster that gives guests views of the Arendelle castle, and Frozen Ever After, a boat ride featuring Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Marshmallow, Sven the reindeer, Olaf the snowman and Pabbie Troll. As visitors float through Frozen Ever After, characters sing songs from the movies, including “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?,” “Let It Go,” and “For the First Time in Forever,” recorded by the movie’s original English-language cast. Michael Moriarty, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland, called World of Frozen “the most immersive attraction we’ve ever built.” He added that the decision to bring World of Frozen to Hong Kong was influenced by the regional interest in the franchise and the unique natural elements of Lantau Island, where Hong Kong Disneyland is located. “I think also when you look at the beautiful space that we have, with our ability to create mountains that wind together with the Lantau mountains and the scenery, to create a very specific and unique immersive environment, I think it was an easy decision that Hong Kong should be the first,” Moriarty told reporters ahead of the opening. Asked how the team chose which scenes and elements to feature, Moriarty said, “when you think about the scenes that really connect you with Anna and Elsa and Kristoff and Sven, we tried to recreate those.” “What we have created here with the World of Frozen is this wonderfully immersive experience where you are at the center of the story,” Moriarty said. In pursuit of a more immersive experience, architecture and design elements in World of Frozen are inspired by Norway, just as Arendelle was in the movies. Visitors can see the 19th-century Dragestil (Norwegian for “dragon style”)-inspired architecture in the storefronts located throughout World of Frozen, and the stylized floral motifs indicative of rosemaling decorative art featured on the clothing worn by cast members. The menu at World of Frozen’s Golden Crocus Inn also draws from Norwegian cuisine and includes a Bayside Seafood Medley in a nod to the harborside location of both Arendelle and the World of Frozen. At night, World of Frozen is alight with Elsa’s “Ice Magic” as the Ice Palace, Arendelle Castle and Friendship Fountain light up an icy blue. Hong Kong’s climate, however, is very different from Norway’s. Snowfall is virtually unheard of here and while November is late autumn in Hong Kong, average temperatures still hit around 75 F (24 C). A ticket to Hong Kong’s Disneyland includes admission to the World of Frozen, though in honor of the new land, the park has introduced a series of four new “Frozen” themed ticket designs showcasing Anna, Elsa, Kristoff and Olaf. Visitors can get to Hong Kong Disneyland by car or via the orange line on Hong Kong’s MTR public transit system. Disney has its own train from Hong Kong’s Sunny Bay station, which is plastered in World of Frozen decals to commemorate the world’s opening.",Travel
Don’t put your bare feet on another passenger’s armrest — and more etiquette tips for a smoother flight," Planes are going to be packed. Patience will be tried. Some level of aggravation is all but inevitable. Throw in a seat-kicker, a tipsy stranger and someone who’s blissfully barefoot in November and the Thanksgiving odyssey becomes a little more challenging. And this year is poised to be a record-setter for air travel. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen more people on the Sunday after the holiday (November 26) than any day in its more than 20-year history, and some airlines are expecting their busiest Thanksgiving travel season ever. It’ll all go more smoothly if every passenger brings some common courtesy along for the ride, so CNN Travel spoke with experts about the best approaches to airplane etiquette. The missing ingredient, in many cases, is self-awareness. People tend to get wrapped up in their own journey and forget that there’s a whole planeload of other passengers. “It’s always kind of mind-blowing to see that because it’s my bag, and my overhead bin, and my seat, and my flight, my connection and, you know, my drink, and it’s very me me me when it comes to just how people behave on an airplane. “And it’s like, there’s hundreds of you,” said Rich Henderson, who’s been a flight attendant for a decade. “You’ve got to be aware of your surroundings, you’ve got to be respectful of the people around you.” Be polite to the flight crew greeting you. “It goes a long way when you’re pleasant to the first person you see on the plane,” said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas. Andrew Henderson, a flight attendant with 20 years of experience, seconds that notion. “A simple ‘hello’ or ‘thank you’ or acknowledgment of our existence is polite. I think that’s some of the etiquette that’s being lost these days with all the noise-canceling headphones and devices we’re on. We’re all so busy that we forget that humans exist in the world,” said Andrew Henderson. He is married to Rich Henderson and together they run the website and social media accounts Two Guys on a Plane, where “the sass is complimentary.” Earbuds and noise-canceling headphones are a double-edged sword: great for blocking out the world when it’s intrusive, but not so great for paying attention when it matters. “We’re there primarily for safety reasons as flight attendants and you know we often joke, but it’s not really a joke, that if there was an emergency situation, half the people would still be on the plane because they have noise-canceling headphones on and they’re in their phones and they’re not paying attention to what’s going on around them,” said Rich Henderson. “And it’s kind of scary to think about.” Passengers lost in their own world also tend to miss things like beverage service and then get annoyed that they’re skipped. “If you see a cart, a flight attendant approaching your row, take your headphones off, look up, acknowledge that they’re there so that we don’t have to have challenging situations in the future,” said Andrew Henderson. But noise canceling devices, which Gottsman called “the universal sign of ‘I don’t want to be bothered,’” obviously come in handy. Neighbor talking your ear off? Put on headphones. And they’re a savior when babies are crying. So put them on your ears and be kind. “I feel like we really need to give grace to traveling parents because we all know … it’s not the baby’s fault, and it puts the parent in such an uncomfortable situation to see people rolling their eyes,” said Gottsman. “They don’t want the baby to cry any more than we do.” But kids-gone-wild scenarios are another story. Inattentive parents frequently make lists of the most annoying behaviors on planes. “The flipside of that is parents — much like in any public space — should be expected to keep an eye on their children,” Gottsman said. “If they’re at a restaurant, if they’re in a grocery store, certainly when they’re in an airplane, for the safety of the child, for the comfort of fellow passengers. You know, be attentive to them kicking the seat in front of them.” Seat-kicking is a frequent passenger complaint, along with armrest-hogging and a laundry list of other grievances. “I think that we all just have to be a little kinder to each other. If someone’s kicking your seat, you have to be an adult and turn around and speak to the person,” said Andrew Henderson. These situations require communication to head off frustration before it happens. “So, if I know I’m a passenger that wants to have the window shade closed the whole flight, I’ll turn to my neighbor and say, ‘Does anyone want the window shade open? It’s my preference to have it closed,’” he said. And if someone else would like it open, there’s room for negotiation. Maybe they like having it open to see out during takeoff and landing but otherwise are fine having it closed. Samantha Brown, TV host and travel expert, takes a more unilateral approach to the window shade question: The window seat occupant decides. “If they would like the shade up, they keep the shade up. The aisle seat person cannot tell the window seat person to put the shade down,” she told CNN recently, and emphatically. Andrew Henderson cautions against such an approach. “If you just get on and are self-absorbed and ‘It’s my window, I’m going to close it if I want to,’ of course you’re going to start a fight that way,” he said. Proceed carefully, window seaters. As for armrests, Gottsman said the middle seat gets priority. “I always say the middle person gets both armrests – gets to choose, let’s put it that way,” she said, adding that the middle seat’s occupant should be able to decide which way they want to lean. Samantha Brown said the middle seat occupant definitely gets both armrests. “The middle seat — they get anything they want.” The seat-reclining question certainly cannot be resolved here. To recline or not to recline is a hot-button issue with many travelers on both sides. But bringing courtesy to whichever way you lean is key. Leaning backwards? “If you’re going to recline your seat back, it’s important to look backwards first and see if somebody’s knees are up against the seat, see if the tray table is down, see if they’ve got food [on the tray table],” said Gottsman. Rich Henderson believes in reclining, with a caveat. “As a general rule, I feel like a person should be able to use their seat the way that it’s designed to be used,” he said, adding that “the right thing to do” on a flight that offers meal service is to put your seat forward during that time. Some of the most egregious air rage incidents of the past few years have involved alcohol. A passenger who’s had a few drinks at the airport bar and has a few more on the plane may not make the best seatmate or customer. Some end up facing hefty fines. “I think that it’s important to drink in moderation,” said Gottman. “If you are going to drink, and that’s fine, don’t over imbibe.” There’s no escaping unpleasant odors in tight quarters, so be conscious of what you choose to bring on a plane. Think twice about fish and hard-boiled eggs, for example. “What’s smelly food to me is not smelly food to someone else, so if you hear people grumbling about your food, maybe the airplane isn’t the best place to eat your fish tacos,” said Andrew Henderson. “Or, know that you have fish tacos and apologize to the group around you that that’s what sounded good to you, ‘I’ll be as quick as I can with eating it.’” Do your personal grooming at home — do not clip your nails en route to grandma’s house. But do tend to your personal hygiene pre-flight. Smelly passengers – from poor hygiene or too much perfume or cologne, are a common complaint, surveys say. Gottsman urges passengers to choose a pair of shoes that will be comfortable throughout the flight — even if your feet swell. “It’s not OK to kick off your shoes and take a little nap,” she said. “The nap is fine, but shoes should stay on. And you don’t want to walk up and down the cabin, to the restroom and back, barefooted or in socks.” Do not, under any circumstance, put your bare feet on another person’s armrest. This happened to Brown in what she called “the most annoying passenger experience I have ever had.” “Right away I feel no problem just turning around and saying, ‘Please don’t do that,’ but first, you need to document,” she said, showing CNN viewers photos of the offending passenger’s bare feet (yup, both feet) with red toenails. That also gave the other passenger’s partner time to say, “Uh, you should remove your feet. She’s taking pictures of them.” Bottom line? “We could all do a little bit better to be nicer to each other,” said Rich Henderson, “especially in such tight quarters.”",Travel
Frozen first as Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes landing in Antarctica," There are short runways, bumpy runways and runways that are notoriously buffeted by crosswinds, but here’s a new one for nervous flyers to get alarmed about: an ice runway. Norse Atlantic Airways landed a Boeing 787 Dreamliner in rather different conditions than usual on Wednesday. The destination: Antarctica. The landing strip: a “blue ice runway” 3,000 meters (9840 feet) long and 60 meters (100 feet) wide, sculpted from the snow and ice. The Dreamliner landed at Troll Airfield on Wednesday just after 2 a.m. – in bright sunlight, since it’s summer in the southern hemisphere at the moment. It’s the first time a Dreamliner – a widebody aircraft which can carry up to 330 passengers, depending on the model – has made it to the sixth continent. But before you start looking to book your own flight to Troll, know that flight N0787 was no regular passenger route. The 45 passengers included scientists from the Norwegian Polar Institute, which had contracted the flight to take them and 12 tons of equipment to the Troll research station in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. It was no quick hop across the ocean, either. The plane departed Oslo on November 13, stopping in Cape Town before heading further south on Wednesday night to make its record-breaking landing. The Dreamliner’s ample cargo space made it the ideal aircraft for the flight, said Daniel Carey of Aircontact, the broker which arranged the flight. Its fuel efficiency was also a factor, said Paul Erlandsson, field service representative at Boeing. The aircraft made it to Antarctica and back to Cape Town without needing to refuel. “It is a great honor and excitement on behalf of the entire team Norse that we have achieved together a momentous moment of landing the first 787 Dreamliner,” Norse Atlantic Airways CEO, Bjørn Tore Larsen, said in a statement. “In the spirit of exploration, we are proud to have a hand in this important and unique mission. It is a true testament to our highly trained and skilled pilots and crew, and our state-of-the-art Boeing aircraft.” Camilla Brekke, the Norwegian Polar Institute director, said that using the larger aircraft was a more sustainable way or reaching the famously fragile continent. “”The most crucial aspect is the environmental gain we can achieve by using large and modern aircraft… [which] can help reduce overall emissions and the environmental footprint in Antarctica,” she said. “Landing such a large aircraft opens up entirely new possibilities for logistics at Troll, which will also contribute to strengthening Norwegian research in Antarctica.”",Travel
How an unexpected Middle East destination is becoming a rock-climbing paradise," Abdulrahman Alabdu hangs off the side of a cliff, drilling into the rock and placing stainless steel bolts in each hole. In this remote corner of Saudi Arabia, his tools are the only sound piercing the silence. He estimates that just 30 to 50 people from outside the region have ever stepped foot here. “This area is really far from everyone,” he says, pausing from his work. “Maybe some hikers have come to explore. But… it’s mainly just the locals who live here and shepherd the sheep.” Alabdu is Saudi Arabia’s first certified rock-climbing instructor. In his spare time, he establishes new climbing routes, hoping to attract more people to the sport. Over the past four years, he says he’s bolted 11 routes in Tanomah, a city in southwestern Saudi Arabia. As Saudi invests in sports both abroad and at home, Alabdu says he wants to personally raise the profile of rock-climbing. “Most people wouldn’t think [Saudi] is a climbing destination. And that’s what we’re working toward – to make it that, by having more routes, making them accessible and then promoting it.” Saudi Arabia has been making global headlines in recent years for major sports investments. From lavish football contracts - including the 2034 soccer World Cup - to launching the LIV golf series,  the country has spent billions on high-profile deals. Critics call this spending “sportwashing,” a way of diverting attention from its human rights record. But officials say it’s a strategy to diversify the oil-based economy as part of Saudi’s Vision 2030 plan. At home, Saudi Arabia is also hard at work encouraging citizens to get more active and live healthier lives. The country hopes to boost the number of Saudis exercising once a week by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government organizes sports events, nationwide campaigns and competitions. While football is Saudi’s most popular sport, between 2015 and 2022 the number of sports federations in the country tripled: Today, the country boasts over 95, including the Saudi Hiking and Climbing Federation, which was established in 2018. Alabdu was born in the southwestern city of Abha and grew up between there and Jeddah. He began climbing in 2014 and, from Australia to Vietnam, he says he’s climbed in at least 17 countries. For a while, he thought he would only be able to pursue his passion abroad. “When I first got back to Saudi … I couldn’t find that quality rock that I was climbing outside of Saudi,” he says. “I thought, ‘I’ll only climb when I travel.’ And that was a bit upsetting.” Everything changed in 2016 when he visited Tanomah for the first time. The region has moderate temperatures most of the year and is home to the Sarawat Mountains, which stretch from southwestern Saudi to Yemen. Not only did Alabdu find more solid rock faces here, which are safer to climb, but the mountain range also offered a variety of climbable routes. And they were accessible from the town. “[Tanomah] is a bit of a drive from Riyadh and also from Jeddah,” he explains. “But it’s worth it when you reach here because … you can easily get from the hotel to the crag in less than 10 minutes. And that I think is a big advantage.” Inspired by this discovery, Alabdu travelled to Nevada to train with the American Mountain Guides Association (AMGA). In 2019, after completing the AMGA single-pitch instructor program, he became the first certified rock-climbing instructor in Saudi Arabia. In 2021, Alabdu founded company that is now called Granite Climbing. He consults with the government and companies looking to establish either indoor or outdoor climbing activities in Saudi Arabia. He also leads expeditions for tourists looking to climb the country’s mountains. And he offers private and group lessons. “A lot of people think that it’s hard as a sport, but in reality, it has all grades… from really easily accessible routes to really advanced routes,” Alabdu says as he rummages through tools in his backpack. “You’ll get people who think, ‘I will never be able to do this.’ And then they do it, and then they do another one, and then all of a sudden, they are rock climbers.” “This is what I love about climbing and about teaching climbing.” Alabdu estimates that he’s given about 300 people climbing lessons in Saudi. Most come for a single introductory course, but a handful have stayed on as regular clients. When he’s not teaching, Alabdu is often in Tanomah bolting new routes. This involves first cleaning a rock face from any loose rock, deciding where to place the stainless steel bolts and then drilling them into place. On this September morning, Alabdu is bolting a path on a crag in Alsharaf Park. He says that the rock face he’s working on is about 2,300 meters high. In addition to the 11 paths he’s charted in Tanomah, Alabdu says he’s bolted roughly 10 others in a small town south of Riyadh. Alabdu’s bolting mission is inspired by his desire to share his passion with others. But he’s also quick to acknowledge his personal motivations as well. Many climbing trips require partners – someone to be on the ground, counterbalancing the climber, a technique known as belaying. And because climbing is still so new in Saudi, belayers can be hard to come by. “That, generally, is a big issue in Saudi – to find climbing partners. But that’s usually resolved by making the climbing area popular,” Alabdu says. “The more traffic you have, the less problem you have finding partners.” “Hopefully this will attract climbers from the GCC [Gulf countries], Saudi and then internationally as well. And this might sound selfish,” he says with a laugh. “But then I will always have belays.”",Travel
World’s largest twin-engine private jet gets interiors fit for royalty," Imagine boarding a plane and stepping into a “cocoon-like” private bedroom fitted with a king-size bed, and a bathroom featuring the largest rain and massage shower ever built on an aircraft, which can merge with the sleeping quarters to form a self-contained retreat, providing total privacy. That’s the centerpiece of Lufthansa Technik’s new cabin design for the upcoming BBJ 777-9 — the private jet version of Boeing’s new widebody aircraft, the 777X. Called CelestialSTAR, the design takes full advantage of the plane’s extremely spacious cabin, which offers 343 square meters (about 3,700 square feet) of space and pairs with the aircraft’s ability to stay in the air for 22 hours — which means it could connect any two cities in the world without stopovers, according to Boeing. But with the combined price of the plane plus the custom interior easily exceeding half a billion dollars, this will be a luxury for the very few. Lufthansa Technik, which is the engineering and maintenance arm of Germany’s flag carrier, says that the concept, which was unveiled this week at the Dubai Airshow, primarily targets customers from royal families in the Middle East. That’s why the design incorporates traditional patterns and influences from the region’s cultural heritage. “It’s a combination between a Middle Eastern touch and a very modern, sleek design,” says Hassan Gasim, a sales director at Lufthansa Technik. “It’s a combination of the old and the new world and this region is famous for that — it values the traditions of the past, but is also very confident about the future.” Other features include a “work & balance” area next to the bedroom and bathroom, fitted with rotating and sliding seats, which passengers can use around large desks but can also turn and move towards the divans off to the side for conversations and meetings. The room comes with “trapezoidal wall niches,” which can be used as displays or exhibits, and then closed to become invisible within the wall structure. The large dining area, Lufthansa says, functions as a “majlis” — the traditional Middle Eastern gathering and meeting room — and offers 11 individual seats and features such as monitors that can be fully retracted into the table. The second half of the cabin has six deluxe suites for guests or a delegation, and there are 32 additional seats in the executive area, equivalent to business class seating. At the back end of the fuselage there’s still space for an Entourage Area, similar to a premium economy cabin. The long-awaited 777X, the world’s largest twin-engine jet, is expected to enter service in 2025, so this concept exists purely on paper for now. But Lufthansa, which will be among the first airlines to operate the type, says the concept is based on the aircraft’s actual specifications, which means it can become a reality should a customer place an order for it. Gasim says Lufthansa Technik has fitted out over 150 Boeing BBJs of various models, but because of confidentiality agreements, it’s never been able to show the work publicly. “So that’s why we’ve come up with those conceptual designs, to show what is actually possible and have a base for discussion,” he says. At the Dubai Airshow, potential customers and curious attendees could experience the designs in virtual reality. For the real thing, the wait is a bit longer. “It takes quite a while to actually put such an aircraft together,” says Clemens Schrettl, also a sales director at Lufthansa Technik, “So I would say the first ones will be delivered to customers in 2027 or 2028.” According to Schrettl, the business jet version of the 777X will be in high demand in the GCC area, which comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. He says there are more than 30 747s in the region flying as private jets, adding, “I’m sure it’s going to be even more than that for the 777X.” The cost to fit one out with the CelestialSTAR cabin will be between $130 and $160 million, he says, plus the price of the aircraft itself, which is about $450 million. The Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) range was developed in the late 1990s to produce dedicated corporate jets based on the Boeing 737, explains Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues. “Boeing then began offering a BBJ variant across all of its models, including widebodies,” he says. “The BBJ line is primarily aimed at ultra-high net worth individuals and heads of state.” Information on buyers and sale prices is rarely disclosed, for privacy reasons, he adds. “The completion price is purely down to the imagination and budget of the customer,” says Crichlow. “It’s a specialist project in and of itself. Once the design is finalized, the actual fitout of the interior is not done by Boeing; after delivery of the aircraft, it is ferried to one of several specialist completion centers that are licensed to carry out the work.” Boeing has produced over 250 BBJs to date, and currently offers models based on the 737 MAX, the 787 and the upcoming 777X. The vast majority of the BBJ fleet is made up of narrowbody aircraft, according to Syed Zaidi, a consultant at aviation analytics firm Cirium. The widebody BBJ family is very limited, Zaidi adds, with around 20 aircraft in service and nearly all of them in a national government or head of state role. They also come with high environmental costs, as private jets emit 10 times more pollutants than commercial planes per passenger. The Boeing 777X was one of the stars of the Dubai Airshow, where it performed a flight demonstration. Among the biggest deals at the airshow, the Emirates airline, which had already ordered 105 777Xs prior to the event, signed up for an additional 90, bringing its total to 205. It also ordered another 35 787s, and 15 Airbus A350s.",Travel
"In a remote corner of Asia, one of the world’s oldest cities continues to awe visitors"," Samarkand. It’s a name that rolls off the tongue, conjuring up images of adventure, exploration and far-away mysteries. Founded in around 700 BCE, it’s one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, a crossroads of cultures and a hub of learning and trading – especially during the heyday of the ancient Silk Road, which passed through the city. Much has been written about this southeastern Uzbekistan gem, but a poem by British novelist and poet James Elroy Flecker (1884-1915) perhaps sums it up best: ”For lust of knowing what should not be known, we take the Golden Road to Samarkand.” With its varied sights, including stunning mosques, mausoleums and madrassas, it certainly is the jewel in the triptych of Uzbekistan’s historical cities, often mentioned in the same breath as Khiva and Bukhara, two other key Silk Road stops famed for their Middle Ages architecture. Here’s a brief overview of what Samarkand has to offer. If you can, allow at least three days to make the most of your visit. The first stop on any Samarkand itinerary should be Registan Square, probably the most photographed location in all of Uzbekistan. The square’s three madrassas – named Ulugbek Madrassah, Sher Dor Madrassah and Tilla-Kari Madrassah – were built between the 15th and 17th centuries. These Islamic schools perfectly encapsulate what the ancient Silk Road, with its centers of learning and trading, was all about. While Registan Square might be the best-known sight in Samarkand, the Shah-i-Zinda is, without doubt, its most impressive. This necropolis has a collection of mausoleums that are showcased in a riot of turquoise tiles, domes and incredible interiors, all dating back to the 14th century. And then there are the many sites connected to Temur, a celebrated 14th-century ruler whose name is ever-present in Uzbekistan. Among the most famous is his final resting place, Samarkand’s Gur-e-Amir – or Amir Temur Mausoleum – a celebration of his life in gold and turquoise. It was completed in 1404 and Timur was interred there after his 1405 death. Meanwhile, legend has it that Samarkand’s Bibi Khanum Mosque was commissioned by Timur’s favorite wife in honor of his homecoming after a long pillaging trip. Today it remains one of the largest mosques in Central Asia, and can welcome some 10,000 worshippers at a time. And then there’s Timur’s grandson, Ulug Bheg. He was a sultan, but also a scientist with a passion for mathematics and astronomy. His work is remembered at the historic Ulug Bheg’s Observatory, which was built in the 1420s on a hill overlooking Samarkand. Today, it showcases the historical measurements of the sun’s path over a year, off by only one minute from today’s measurements. In the northeast of the city is the Mausoleum of St. Daniel, an Old Testament prophet. The exact location of his remains is a topic of debate, with numerous countries claiming to possess them. According to local legend, Samarkand’s Mausoleum of St. Daniel contains a collection of the prophet’s relics that continues to grow with time, forcing them to repeatedly extend the sarcophagus to its current length – 18 meters (59 feet). Uzbek cuisine is as varied as the country’s landscape and Samarkand is no exception. The national dish is plov – basically pilaf or pilau. This rice dish can be made with a wide variety of ingredients including carrots, beef, raisins and onions. Every family in every region has their own plov recipe, and you just have to keep trying them to find your perfect match. Accompanying most meals is obi non, a style of bread that’s freshly made in a clay oven, then stamped and decorated with a spiky tool that can be picked up at any given souvenir stand. If you’re after healthy options, don’t miss achichuk – tomato salad with onions and a hint of chili – or opt for manti, which are dumplings filled with pumpkin or spinach. There’s also samsa – samosas with various, but mostly meat fillings – while the ubiquitous shashlik are skewers of various types of meat. If you’re craving noodles, lagman is another common dish worth sampling. As for local delicacies that might not appeal to everyone, there’s kurt. You’ll see these small, hard, white balls laid out on nibbling dishes and at markets. These are dried cheese snacks, made from soured, fermented milk sourced from local animals. Legend has it that they were popular with travelers during the Silk Road days. One of the best restaurants in town serving traditional Uzbek food is Platan. Offering big portions, wine and lovely decor, it’s the perfect place for a memorable Samarkand dinner. For a cheap and fun place to fill up while sightseeing, head to the Siab Bazaar. Here, travelers will find many classic Uzbek dishes, including hot obi non, samsa, shashlik and kurt. All cheap, all fresh. No Uzbekistan visit would be complete without enjoying its ancient tea tradition. Pots are shared on every occasion and in between. Whilst the younger generation is embracing the coffee-to-go trend, older locals still enjoy a pot of tea with thier food. Uzbekistan’s traditional chaykhanas, or tea houses, are becoming rarer, but Samarkand’s Bibikhanum Teahouse offers an authentic experience. Samarkand has been welcoming international visitors for millennia and offers a wide range of accommodations. There are some international chains represented, such as the Hilton and Regency, but they tend to be in the new part of the city, away from the historical sights. Your best bet is to opt for a boutique hotel near Registan Square, placing most main sights within walking distance. The Bibikhanum Hotel is steps away from the Bibi Khanum Mosque and the Siab Bazaar. It features the traditional craftsmanship and architectural style of the region;  rooms are basic but with full amenities. Meanwhile, Kosh Havuz is a modern boutique hotel, within walking distance of Bibi Khanum, Registan Palace and Shah-i-Zinda, and has spacious rooms, even more spacious bathrooms and a rooftop terrace restaurant. And finally, L’Argamak, a comfortable hotel with a little courtyard garden, is steps away from the Amir Temur Mausoleum. If you’re staying in the old section of the city, walking is the best option, as there are many small lanes to explore and maneuver. For longer distances, such as the railway station, airport or sights such as Ulug Bheg’s Observatory, taxis are cheap and easy to hail. Negotiate before you get in, as many taxis do not have a meter, though the fares tend to be fair and cheap. Just make sure you’ve got cash in the local currency. For longer day trips, such as to Shakhrisabz, hiring a private driver and guide is your best option. Uzbekistan’s largest international airport is in the capital, Tashkent. From there, you can either catch an onward flight with Uzbekistan Airways to Samarkand or hop on a train. With the rail connection, there are several options of varying speeds. The fastest is the Afrosiyob Express, which gets travelers to Samarkand in around two hours, only a touch slower than the flight. Train seats can be booked online, but fill up fast, so book early.",Travel
The world’s ‘best tourism villages’ for 2023," Tokyo? Been there. London? Done that. For travelers who want to visit a smaller, more authentic local destination, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has released this year’s list of the best tourism villages. For 2023, 55 villages were recognized by the international organization, which focuses on sustainable tourism, up from 32 last year. The first class of villages was announced in 2021, when the program started. The list includes small towns and villages from places as diverse as Mexico, China, Ethiopia, and Italy. There’s no ranking of the villages, and they are all listed in alphabetical order in English. The UNWTO says it recognizes “rural tourism destinations with accredited cultural and natural assets, a commitment to preserving community-based values, and a clear commitment to innovation and sustainability.” The program also states that its goals include reversing the trend of rural depopulation and empowering women and children. Dongbaek, on South Korea’s Jeju Island, is famed for its camellia flowers. Jeju itself is known for camellia sinensis – aka tea – but Dongbaek focuses on the flowers, organizing a cooperative where local residents sell camellia seeds to visitors and care for the plants on the island. Another Asian village recognized by UNWTO is Shirakawa, Japan. Located in Gifu prefecture north of Nagoya, this town is beloved in the winter, when the pointed, thatched roofs on the village homes are covered in snow, creating a beautiful effect. China has four villages on this year’s roster, including Xiajiang in eastern Zhejiang province, where locals keep traditions like tea making and Chinese opera alive by teaching them to visitors. Dhordo, in the Rann of Kutch salt desert, is this year’s selected village in India. The UNWTO noted that while Dhordo faced significant damage from a 2001 earthquake, the town has been able to grow and rebuild thanks to a thoughtful tourism strategy. Europe’s selections to the UNWTO list represent a mix of cultural and environmental differences. In Spain, the village of Sigüenza is a popular weekend getaway from capital Madrid thanks to its 12th-century cathedral and easy access to Barranco del Río Dulce Natural Park. Slunj, Croatia got high marks for keeping traditions like local songs and dances alive while also putting in eco-friendly walking trails and other travel infrastructure. The tiny, landlocked principality of Andorra isn’t as well-known as its neighbors, but its village of Ordino was recognized for its agricultural history as well as two local festivals, Les Falles and the Feast of Sant Pere, both of which are on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Peru leads the list with five villages getting recognition. Though the country is famous for Machu Picchu, Peru has made efforts to highlight other places as a way to combat overtourism. Yanque, about 360 miles southeast of Lima, is the access point to the fascinating but lesser-visited Uyo Uyo ruins and the Colca Canyon hot springs region. Meanwhile, another Peruvian village, Chacas, is the gateway to Huascaran National Park, a UNESCO-recognized Biosphere Reserve. Also on the UNWTO list are Caleta Tortel, Chile, a village of just 523 residents where many structures are made of a cypress wood local to the area, and La Carolina, Argentina, which was home to a famous gold rush. • Al Sela, Jordan• Barrancas, Chile• Biei, Japan• Caleta Tortel, Chile• Cantavieja, Spain• Chacas, Peru• Chavín de Huantar, Peru• Dahshour, Egypt• Dhordo, India• Dongbaek, Republic of Korea• Douma, Lebanon• Ericeira, Portugal• Filandia, Colombia• Hakuba, Japan• Higueras, Mexico• Huangling, China• Jalpa de Cánovas, Mexico• Kandovan, Iran• La Carolina, Argentina• Lephis Village, Ethiopia• Lerici, Italy• Manteigas, Portugal• Morcote, Switzerland• Mosan, Republic of Korea• Oku-Matsushima, Japan• Omitlán de Juárez, Mexico• Oñati, Spain• Ordino, Andorra• Oyacachi, Ecuador• Paucartambo, Peru• Penglipuran, Indonesia• Pisco Elqui, Chile• Pozuzo, Peru• Saint-Ursanne, Switzerland• Saty, Kazakhstan• Schladming, Austria• Sehwa, Republic of Korea• Sentob, Uzbekistan• Shirakawa, Japan• Sigüenza, Spain• Şirince, Türkiye• Siwa, Egypt• Slunj, Croatia• Sortelha, Portugal• Anton am Arlberg, Austria• Tân Hoá, Viet Nam• Taquile, Peru• Tokaj, Hungary• Văleni, Moldova• Vila da Madalena, Portugal• Xiajiang, China• Zapatoca, Colombia• Zhagana, China• Zhujiawan, China",Travel
"As a kid she posed with her pilot dad in the cockpit. Years later they recreated the photo, with a twist"," The first time Jasmijn van Waalwijk van Doorn accompanied her pilot father, Jorrit van Waalwijk van Doorn, to work was a day to remember. It was 2006. Eight-year-old Jasmijn joined Jorrit on a KLM flight traveling from their home country of the Netherlands to Uganda. Pilot Jorrit flew the Boeing 767 there and back. Jasmijn and her mother Ellen were passengers.  Before the flight to Uganda took off, Ellen took a picture of her husband and daughter in the cockpit. In the photo, Jorrit’s clutching the controls, Jasmijn is clutching a beloved lion toy. She’s got one arm around her father. Both are smiling widely. Cut to 2019. Jorrit and Jasmijn once again found themselves in an airplane cockpit together. It was another day to remember. This time round, Jasmijn wasn’t a passenger – she was a qualified KLM pilot, flying alongside her dad for the first time. When Jasmijn packed her suitcase that morning, she’d made sure to include the beloved lion toy among her belongings. Then, before the flight took off, Jasmijn and Jorrit recreated the photo from over a decade previously. Once again, Jorrit clutched the controls and Jasmijn clutched the lion toy. Both smiled proudly. The main difference between the photos? The now adult Jasmijn is wearing a KLM pilot uniform. And right after the photo was taken, Jasmijn got behind the controls, ready to fly the Boeing 777 to Hong Kong. It was Jasmijn’s mother Ellen who suggested her husband and daughter recreate the 2006 photo. “She said, ‘We have that picture of the two of you in the cockpit. Why not take the toy again, and take the same picture again?’” Jasmijn tells CNN Travel. “I was happy that I still had the toy because it’s so special to have that picture.” “It started off as a fun thing,” Jorrit tells CNN Travel. “But it was nice to see the two pictures together, then and now.” The 2006 flight to Uganda was the first of many times young Jasmijn accompanied Jorrit on flights. Jasmijn remembers how exciting it was going on a safari and spotting lions that resembled her beloved cuddly toy. Eight-year-old Jasmijn fell in love with traveling – and then, over time, she fell in love with flying. “That’s how I got to know the job – and where it started,” says Jasmijn. When Jasmijn was growing up, Jorrit flew intercontinental flights for KLM. He was often gone for several days. If he could bring Jasmijn and her siblings with him, he would. “You can invest in your relationship with your kid, and she can see what you’re doing. And then it’s more normal for her,” he says. “We’d always do nice things on routes.” Jasmijn’s mother Ellen is a flight attendant, so flying for a living was “normal” to Jasmijn growing up. “It’s not only because of my dad that I’m interested in aviation,” she says. Jasmijn aspired to be a pilot from an early age. At 12, she had her first flying lesson. Aged 14, she embarked on a gliding course. By the time she was in high school, Jasmijn was set on her career path. “That’s when it became serious,” she says today. “I thought, ‘This is my dream, I want to be a pilot.’” Jasmijn trained at the KLM Flight Academy, qualifying in 2018 when she was 20. Since that first flight together in 2019, Jorrit and Jasmijn have flown together 17 times. The father daughter pilot duo quickly learned how to segue between familial comfort and professionalism – for example, Jasmijn decided early on that it made sense to call her dad by his first name when they were on the clock together. Jorrit says flying together was always “very natural”, adding that they’ve got a “nice dynamic.” Jorrit and Jasmijn take their jobs seriously, but their flights together are always infused with fun. They enjoy finding humor and joy in the air. As the more junior of the pair, Jasmijn also appreciates the opportunity to learn from Jorrit’s experience and watch him at work, but Jorrit says this education goes both ways. “She’s a new generation pilot,” he says. “The way she looks at things is a little bit different than how I learned to do it.” Before every flight, airline crew are sent what’s called a crew manifest – a list of who’s going to be working that day’s flight, usually with an accompanying photo. Colleagues often figure out Jasmijn and Jorrit are related thanks to their shared last name, but if they don’t pick up on that, it’s the crew manifest photos which give it away: Jasmijn and Jorrit use a selfie of the two of them, cropped into two individual portraits. They always enjoy seeing who puts two and two together. And when fellow KLM employees realize they’re related, Jasmijn says they’re always enthuasiastic and excited. For Jasmijn and Jorrit, working together also means getting to travel the world together. Sometimes family members will join them too – last summer, Jorrit and Jasmijn flew Jasmijn’s mother, brother and sister to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for a memorable family vacation. As Jasmijn, now 25, gets further into adulthood, she says she’s also becoming increasingly conscious that getting to spend quality time with her father is a privilege. “I’m aware that it’s very, very special to get to go to many places, just the two of you,” she says. “It’s creating a lot of memories.” “If you have the opportunity to do things like this together, then really just enjoy it as much as you can.” Aviation remains a male dominated profession, and Jasmijn is grateful for her father’s encouragement she expressed an interest in following in his footsteps. She also hopes the tide is changing and the aviation landscape is becoming more diverse. “There are more female pilots,” she says. “I like that a lot.” Jorrit is also keen to encourage anyone – regardless of gender or background – who is passionate about aviation to consider entering the industry. “When she was 10, telling people she wanted to become a pilot, people looked at her and thought, ‘Wow, how cute,’ or ‘How funny,’” he says. “But if you really want to achieve something, and you go for it, it’s possible.” Jorrit is now 55 and approaching compulsory retirement. Right now, he’s also working in a different area of KLM to Jasmijn, so the father daughter pilot team reckon their days flying together are numbered. “I’m going to miss Jasmijn flying with me. But I’ve got nice memories of flying together, which was really, really special,” he says. Plus, Jorrit’s retirement won’t spell the end of family adventures. Jasmijn is currently working to become a first officer, which will mean conducting takeoffs and landings herself. This, she says, will create another day to remember. “One of my dreams is to take my dad on a flight with me so that he can see my landing,” she says.",Travel
Find out why this garden has been named ‘the most beautiful in Japan’ for 20+ years," In Japan, gardening isn’t just a hobby – it’s an art form with spiritual significance. But while gardens across the country get lots of love on social media, many Japanese will swear their fealty to one that’s off the beaten track – the garden at the Adachi Museum of Art in bucolic Shimane prefecture, a three-hour train trip from Osaka. The US-based Sukiya Living magazine (formerly Journal of Japanese Gardening) has awarded the Adachi Museum its highest honor – most beautiful traditional garden – for more than 20 years running. Despite accolades coming from outside of Japan, the museum and gardens remain relatively unknown compared to those in Kyoto and Tokyo. Many Western visitors to Japan are confused when they visit a Japanese garden, only to not see a single flower. Japanese gardens place emphasis on different kinds of plants, like moss or trees, or may just consist of rocks in a finely manicured bed of sand. They’re not just about big, colorful blooms – there’s a more subtle dynamic at play. “Gardens in Japan do aspire to high art in a way that they don’t in the West,” explains Sophie Walker, author of the book “The Japanese Garden.” “Mitate is the idea that the imagination can leap. You can see a rock, know that it’s a human-scale rock, but in that moment you can come to it and see it as a mountain. So I think that’s why the garden is so powerful, because it depends on the viewer. What you bring to it matters the mind with which you come.” On the walls of the Adachi Museum of Art are paintings by some of Japan’s best modern artists. But many patrons ignore the building entirely and prefer to spend their entire visit looking out the window. Here, the different gardens – a pine grove, a rock garden and a moss garden, among others – are intended to be seen but not trampled through. They were conceived like paintings, made from trees and plants rather than oil and pastel. In turn, the museum was designed to “frame” the garden, with its large picture windows specifically made to highlight the garden’s most notable features. “Japanese paintings are difficult to appreciate, even when people come to see them, whereas gardens are easy for anyone to look at,” explains Takodori Adachi, the grandson of founder Zenko Adachi and the current director of the museum. “Before looking at Japanese paintings, you can look at these Japanese gardens and understand them in this sequence. The art museum was designed so it would be easier to look at.” Signs in Japanese and English apologize that gardeners or other maintenance workers may be toiling in the garden during the day – a way of acknowledging that there are human beings behind the gardens’ seemingly effortless elegance. Getting to the museum itself is a journey. Shimane and its neighbor Tottori are the two least-populous prefectures in all of Japan, comprising part of the rural San’in region. But, as Adachi explains, the reason the gardens are so special isn’t just because of what’s in them – it’s because of what’s around them. “The Japanese gardens are integrated with the mountains in the background,” he says. “There are Japanese gardens in Kyoto, shrines and other places, but they are small and compact. As soon as you enter this museum, you feel a sense of unity with the mountain behind you. “These kinds of Japanese gardens were created precisely by virtue of this location, so the charm of the Adachi Museum of Art cannot be conveyed anywhere else.” Another way to experience the scenery is by stopping by one of the museum’s tea rooms. Here, guests can enjoy matcha and sweets while drinking up the views as well, with windows designed for the best possible angles. Japan’s glamorous high-speed Shinkansen trains don’t come here. Instead, travelers can travel on the express train beginning in Osaka or Tokyo going as far as Okayama, then switch to a slower local train that plods northward across the island of Honshu until they arrive in Matsue, the capital of Shimane. To get to Adachi, travelers should catch the local commuter train from Matsue to the smaller town of Yasugi. At Yasugi train station, there is a free shuttle that ferries people back and forth to the museum. There are just 28 seats on the bus, which can become an issue in peak summer and spring travel seasons as queues begin early in the day. Return trips to Yasugi are free, but guests should pick up a laminated ticket from the Adachi lobby as a way to reserve their spot back, especially if they are trying to get a specific return train. The Matsue tourist information center, in a glass box directly outside of Matsue station, has helpful maps and train schedules printed out in English and Japanese. The Adachi Museum’s multiple gift shops are also worth some time. Rather than just selling postcards and other items printed with popular pieces from the museum, the shops – which are located in standalone buildings between the bus stop and the museum entrance – highlight specialties from Shimane, mostly in the form of food and drink. Some highlights include a line of craft beer named after Lafcadio Hearn, the Greek-born writer who spent much of his life living in Matsue, soft-serve ice cream that is flavored with wild pears growing in the region and genji maki – sweets with red bean paste inside mini crepe-like pancakes rolled up into triangles. Other than the soft serve, most products come pre-packaged in prettily decorated boxes, making them an easy choice for souvenirs. And just like everything else at Adachi, even the items in the shops were immaculately planned down to the smallest cookie. “If (the museum) becomes famous, it will also promote the local area,” Adachi’s director explains. For now, though, the museum is an oasis in a country coping with overtourism at some of its more popular destinations. Mount Fuji, for instance, is battling the real-time repercussions of having too many visitors. The sacred site is now dealing with garbage, erosion, and “reckless” hikers, resulting in concerns that it could lose its UNESCO World Heritage status.

When is a car faster than a plane? When it’s electric," Spotting the tiny Elektra Trainer aircraft from far off was never going to be an easy task. Despite its bright orange fuselage, the small two-seater airplane was barely visible – a tiny dark speck against a cloudy sky that was getting darker by the minute. On top of that, the aircraft’s electric engines had ensured an almost silent approach, offering no clues about its position. Until, all of a sudden, it was there! Members of the E-Flight Challenge team lined up to watch the battery-powered airplane gracefully descend on the island of Norderney, just off the northwest coast of Germany. The landing, mere minutes before sunset on August 29, marked the end of the E-Flight Challenge 2023, which pitted the battery-powered Elektra Trainer aircraft against a Lucid Motors Air sports car, also electric. Both the aircraft and the car had departed earlier that day from Gelnhausen, a grass airfield near Frankfurt-am-Main, some 300 kilometers (186 miles) south, in a quest to be the first to reach the island. The purpose of this stunt, devised by a group of electric mobility enthusiasts, was to showcase the expanding capabilities of this promising and fast-developing technology. You could say that the E-Flight Challenge takes its inspiration from the early days of aviation. From Louis Blériot’s hop across the English Channel in 1909 to Charles Lindbergh’s famous 1927 transatlantic solo crossing, aviation history has often been made on the back of competitive challenges that were eagerly accepted by daring pioneers. Fast forward a century, and that spirit of discovery has landed in the field of electric aviation – a small segment of the industry that is steadily expanding its capabilities. Electric cars are becoming mainstream across the planet, and in countries such as Norway they already make up a solid majority of new vehicle sales – but it’s a different story in electric aviation. The energy requirements of even the smallest of aircraft are in an entirely different league compared to cars. Existing battery technology simply hasn’t yet reached the energy density levels required to power anything more than the smallest categories of aircraft on a short flight. The Elektra Trainer used in the E-Flight Challenge, for example, can carry a maximum of two people. The batteries currently on the market simply don’t cut it, power-wise. Adding larger battery packs doesn’t work in an aircraft – it would just add a massive weight penalty that could seriously impair the performance. Even one of the most ambitious electric aircraft developers, Heart Aerospace – a Swedish startup that has racked up orders and investment from United Airlines and other prominent industry players – announced in 2022 that it was dropping pure electric propulsion for the aircraft they’re developing. This was in order to  adopt a hybrid-electric approach that would allow it to develop an airliner for up to 30 seats – still a minnow by industry standards. Italy’s Tecnam, an aircraft manufacturer that partnered with Rolls-Royce and Norwegian regional airline Widerøe in an electric airliner project in 2021, also announced the suspension of its own electric aircraft project this summer, after three years of research, claiming that battery technology is not yet mature enough. But a recent raft of announcements – this time coming from battery developers – offers solid reasons for hope. China’s CATL, a global leader in battery technology, announced in April 2023 that it had developed a 500 watt-hours–per-kilogram battery, which would represent a significant step forward – almost double what’s currently on the market, which is around 270 watt-hours per kilogram. This was followed, a few days later by Cuberg, the California-based subsidiary of Swedish battery giant Northvolt, announcing progress in its development of a new generation of lithium-metal batteries which have been shown in testing to provide 380 watt-hours per kilogram – a gain of 40%. The electrification of larger airliners, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-sized aircraft that conduct most flights nowadays, remains a distant prospect. Aerospace giants Airbus and Boeing have been looking at other technologies such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels as decarbonizing alternatives, since the idea of a battery-powered large passenger aircraft seems currently unattainable. “Given all that uncertainty we need to take a portfolio approach, continue development and narrow down the uncertainty. Only then will we be able to decide exactly what solution will be right for which part of the market,” Robin Riedel, partner at management consultancy firm McKinsey, tells CNN. In 2021 Riedel and this team at McKinsey co-authored a study that estimated that 17.4% of global commercial aviation emissions are produced by flights under 600 miles (the figure doesn’t include short flights performed by flight schools, light aircraft flights and other forms of private aviation). This is a segment of the industry that could be decarbonized relatively fast with novel forms of propulsion that are already available, including hybrid-electric, battery-electric and hydrogen-fuel-cell electric planes. The advantages would not be just environmental. Since electric motors have fewer moving parts than fossil fuel ones, proponents of electric aviation are confident that, once the range problem is sorted, the lower maintenance and operational costs of electric aircraft will entice operators to make the switch. One of the companies that is eagerly awaiting the arrival of electric aircraft is Berlin-based private aviation operator Air2E, which supported the E-Flight Challenge. Its founder and CEO, Norbert Werle, likes to draw a parallel with the early years of electric cars. “Before Tesla became the household name that it is now, it released the Roadster, which was not exactly a success, but this opened the road. It showed it was possible to make cool electric cars,” he says. Werle hopes that if electric aircraft deliver on cost reductions, they will also absorb some of the traffic that currently moves by road. This is the assumption upon which some entrepreneurs are building the business cases for new electric-powered regional air mobility businesses. One of them is Electra.aero, which is developing a hybrid-electric short takeoff and landing aircraft (eSTOL – STOL aircraft are capable of using very short runways) with the capacity to transport nine passengers or 2,500 lbs of cargo for distances of up to 500 miles. The rationale to develop this type of aircraft is that its lower operational and environmental cost will open up many routes that today are not economically viable, by connecting thousands of underused airfields across the US and other countries. The Virginia-based firm, however, remains cautious about all-electric aircraft and has opted for hybrid-electric technology combining fuel with an electric powertrain, just like a hybrid car. It considers that only hybrid technology is capable of offering energy densities closer to those of the turboprop aircraft already operated by many regional airlines. “Aircraft that use only batteries are just not a viable solution for these missions in the foreseeable future. Even with the recent advances, it is likely to be decades before battery technology achieves the energy density it needs in order to be used in commercially viable battery-only aircraft,” says founder and CEO, John Langford. “It took the automotive industry 15 years to move from viable hybrid-electric to battery-only vehicles, and it is fair to say the aviation industry will take even longer. Hybrid-electric aircraft allow you to make a meaningful step to improve emissions today and can improve as battery technologies evolve.” In this context, the E-flight Challenge served as an illustration of the challenges of electric flight – but also of its promise. While the aircraft would be able to hold a relatively straight course across land and sea to Norderney, the road team were counting on the Lucid Air car’s advertised 500-mile range and the absence of speed limits on long stretches of German autobahn. Range was to be, not entirely unexpectedly, the Achilles heel of the aircraft team. The Elektra Trainer had to make a pitstop roughly halfway along the route, spending two and a half hours on the ground recharging its batteries at Oerlinghausen airfield. That, ultimately, lost it the race. Once the car reached the ferry terminal on Germany’s northern coast, ready to sail over to the island, it was game over. The Lucid Motors team drove into Norderney airport at 6.13 p.m. local time – seven hours after they had started. The aircraft arrived about an hour later. Far from being disappointed, though, the organizers were exultant. Who got there first was, ultimately, a secondary matter. “The accomplishment was to prove that it is feasible to perform such fully electric cross-country flight in just one day. The progress compared to just three years ago has been astonishing!” explains Morell Westermann, one of the E-Flight Challenge initiators. In 2020, alongside other electric aviation enthusiasts, Westermann completed a record-setting flight from the foothills of the Swiss Alps, all the way to the very same island of Norderney, following a similar route, although flying a different model of electric aircraft. That flight made six world records, including one for the longest distance flown electrically, the fastest average speed over 100 kilometers, the highest altitude and lowest number of stopovers – all for electric-powered flights. To put things in context, that flight required three days and 11 re-charging stops to cover the 700-kilometer (435-mile) itinerary, while the 2023 E-Flight Challenge required only one stop for the 300-kilometer journey between the Frankfurt area and the North Sea. How many stops will the next challenge require we can only guess, but chances are that relentless, incremental advances in the field of electric aviation will keep taking its participants further, faster and, of course, emissions-free. Westermann, who flies electric planes in his free time, dares to make a prediction: “In 2026, three years from now, technology will be mature enough to fly this distance in just one go!”",Travel
The history of Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade: 5 facts you may not know," As far as holiday traditions go, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is about as essential to the cozy November holiday as turkey and stuffing. While it’s had some interruptions and mishaps along the way, the show has still managed to go on almost every year for nearly a century. Let’s look back at five historical facts about the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade: The original store was about 20 blocks south on Sixth Avenue near 14th Street. Macy’s has been at its current flagship location, at Broadway and 34th Street, since 1902. Continuing expansion made the location what Macy’s called the “world’s largest store,” an entire city block with more than 1 million square feet of retail space. In celebration, employees organized a Christmas parade in 1924 featuring “floats, bands, animals from the zoo and 10,000 onlookers,” according to a Macy’s history page. It also started way up at 145th Street. The parade concluded with Santa Claus and the unveiling of the store’s Christmas windows. Three years later, the Christmas Parade was renamed the Thanksgiving Day Parade. Macy’s didn’t invent the practice. Philadelphia has the oldest Thanksgiving Day parade: Its Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade, now the 6ABC - Dunkin’ Thanksgiving Day Parade, debuted in 1920. You had to use your visual imagination when the first broadcasts of the parade took place in 1932 – that’s because they were on the radio. The parade was first televised in 1946 in New York and then nationally on NBC the next year. According to Mental Floss, the balloon attractions debuted in 1927, inspired by a balloon float. Even then, they were massive – one was a 60-foot dinosaur – and, in those days, they had more to deal with than just high winds and crazy weather: Until 1938, an elevated train ran down Sixth Avenue. Well-known characters have been part of the parade since that 1927 outing. Felix the Cat was there from the beginning, and Mickey Mouse joined in 1934, the same year that featured a balloon based on popular entertainer Eddie Cantor. “Peanuts” characters, especially Snoopy – who made his first appearance in 1968 – are regular visitors. One tradition didn’t last long. The balloons were originally allowed to float away, and those who found them got a gift certificate from Macy’s. For years, the parade’s Midtown route went right down Broadway, Manhattan’s spine. But in 2009, the route was moved to Seventh Avenue because of new pedestrian plazas along Broadway. It was changed to Sixth Avenue in 2011. Given the parade’s draw as a tourist attraction, this did not go over well with some folks. For 2019, the route started at 77th Street and Central Park West, where it took a left turn at 59th Street. It continued to ride past Central Park until it reached Sixth Avenue. From there, it headed down to 34th Street, where it hung a right and ended at the flagship store. And because of the pandemic, 2020 saw a very shortened only-for-TV route near the flagship store. You can check out the 2.5-mile route for 2023 on Macy’s website. In 1957, a wet day got wetter for people near a Popeye balloon: The character’s hat filled with water and drenched parade watchers. The same thing happened in 1962 with a Donald Duck hat. Superman once lost his arm to tree branches. But the worst was probably 1997, a blustery day in the Big Apple. During that parade, winds reached more than 40 miles per hour, and the balloons were difficult to control. One balloon struck a lamppost and injured four people; one woman was in a coma for a month. The Pink Panther threatened a woman holding its ropes. “The balloon was caught on top of me and my daughter,” she told The New York Times. “We thought it was going to smother us.”",Travel
This state that booms in summer might be even better under the snow," For all the buzz Alaska gets for summertime’s wildlife adventures and busy cruising season, visiting the state during the quieter winter months has a unique appeal that goes beyond the chance to see the northern lights. “One of the things I try to explain to people is we don’t get that black darkness so many places get in winter because we have snow on the ground, and it reflects all the light around,” says Lexi Qass’uq Trainer, a member of Chevak Native Village who lives in Eagle River near Anchorage. “We get this blue glow all winter long.” “Living in Alaska is absolutely amazing, but to make it through the winter, you have to have winter activities you enjoy doing,” she says. For tourists, those winter activities can be as adventurous or low-key as you like, from ice skating on a frozen glacier lake after touching down on it by helicopter and mushing your own sled dog team, to practicing yoga under the northern lights or taking in a hydrotherapy circuit at a Nordic-inspired spa. Interest from travelers curious to experience Alaska in winter is growing, says Diane Nigg of Adventures for Alaskans, a Virtuoso-affiliated travel agency. “With all of the better air service compared to a couple years ago, Alaska is easier to get to. There are so many more nonstop flights to Alaska now,” she says, mentioning nonstop routes from Lower 48 cities such as Dallas and Minneapolis into Anchorage on American and Delta. Flights to Alaska are also far less expensive during the winter (outside of the holiday period) than during the summer, she says. And compared with popular winter destinations in Scandinavia, she says Alaska is a less pricey destination overall. “Within driving distance of Anchorage, you can combine things like skiing, dog sledding, looking for the Northern Lights, ice fishing and flightseeing,” she says. “You do more and pay less here than in Scandinavia.” To see the northern lights on a budget, she recommends flying into Fairbanks or Anchorage, booking a cheap hotel and renting a car to drive to the outskirts of town to scope the night sky. Read on for other epic ways to experience Alaska this winter: Guests can grip the sled handlebar tight and learn to mush their own team of Alaskan huskies across the tundra during multiday tours with Squid Acres Kennel Sled Dog Tours near Denali National Park. The outfitter provides extreme cold weather clothing and gear, including sleeping bags rated to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius as well). Nights are spent at scenic camps with wood-stove-heated tents and forays under the night skies to look for the aurora borealis. “Being on the back of a dogsled watching the dogs trot effortlessly down the trail is a practice in being in the present. It is all of the emotions and exhilaration,” says Deborah Colby of Missoula, Montana, who took part in a seven-day trip in March 2023. The tours also include overnights with more luxury at Susitna Adventure Lodge. The 11-day, late-February Iditarod & Aurora Adventure with tour operator John Hall’s Alaska is a trip of a lifetime through a state like no other. It kicks off with guests attending the Iditarod Mushers Banquet in Anchorage to meet mushers embarking on the epic sled dog race that’s more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) long. Other highlights during this overland tour by bus include hopping a flight to a remote village along the course to meet the teams at an Iditarod checkpoint, a photography lesson with a professional northern lights photographer, glacier flightseeing, dog sledding and the chance to try curling at the World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks. Making time for winter wellness can help you weather Alaska’s cold. And at Salted Roots in Seward, set on an inlet along the Kenai Peninsula, guests stay in cozy A-frame cabins surrounded by a spruce forest for two-night winter wellness packages that include private yoga lessons and massage as well as plenty of sauna time. A newly renovated sister property, Rustic Roots, with rustic seaside cabins, is opening next door in January 2024. Winter tours into Kenai Fjords National Park, a landscape of rugged coastal fjords and glaciers, include winter sea kayaking on Resurrection Bay and snowmobiling and snowcat tours with Adventure Sixty North to the glacier viewpoint at the park’s Exit Glacier Nature Center. There’s ice skating on a rink, and then there’s ice skating between towering mounds of ice on a glacier lake you’ve touched down on in a helicopter. New this winter, Alaska Helicopter Tours is offering a Winter Heli Ice Skating adventure that lifts off from Alaska Glacier Lodge (in Palmer, an hour’s drive from Anchorage) that includes flightseeing over the Chugach Range and Knik Glacier. The pilot will scout for the perfect glacier lake to land on for a stint of wild ice skating that will ruin you for indoor rinks for life. The company also offers winter heli snowshoeing tours to the Knik Glacier. North of Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley (Mat-Su Valley) is hosting the 2024 Arctic Winter Games from March 10 to 16. The games draw some 2,000 youth athletes from regions across the Arctic — among them Northern Europe’s Sápmi region; Canada’s Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavik; and Alaska — to compete in 20 sports. The games include heritage Dene games such as snowsnake and stick pull as well as curling, hockey and other winter sports. One of the event’s highlights is a cultural gala showcasing yoiking (a traditional song form of the Sami people), Inuit throat singing, drumming and dancing from across the circumpolar region. The state-owned Alaska Railroad  — a year-round lifeline for off-gridders living in some of Alaska’s most remote reaches as well as a vital Alaska freight route — offers unique wintertime sightseeing for tourists. From mid-September to mid-May, the Aurora Winter Train travels between Anchorage and Fairbanks on 12-hour journeys with flagstop service in spots such as Talkeetna, where you can consider detouring for wintertime adventures that include dog sledding adventures and flightseeing in Denali National Park. Talkeetna is also the departure point for the Hurricane Turn Train, which travels a ridiculously scenic backcountry route through the wilderness of the Indian River Valley, where residents living off-the-grid in remote hunting and fishing cabins flag down the train for the ride back south. With solar activity reaching 11-year-high levels in 2024 and 2025, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are predicting strong northern lights displays. Visitors can up their odds of seeing the show with a stay in one of the clear-roofed “igloos” or cube accommodations outside of Fairbanks at Borealis Basecamp, where the colors could come curtaining down at any moment right over the bed. Removed from the city lights within a boreal forest, the property is opening a new Cube Suite this spring that can accommodate a family of five and has its own private sauna. While the property is sold out this winter for direct bookings, booking a tour with an operator such as John Hall’s Alaska or Alaska Railroad can secure your stay. Off-the-grid outfitter Arctic Hive is even farther north from Fairbanks under the Auroral Oval deep in Alaska’s Brooks Range (called the Himalayas of the Arctic). “Despite our location, 63 miles north of the Arctic Circle in the remote Brooks Mountain Range, winter is our busy season,” says Mollie Busby, who runs four- to five-night retreats at the property she owns with her husband, Sean. Guests depart from Fairbanks and travel along the Dalton Highway by van, then hike in to reach the rustic cabins heated by Swedish oil drip stoves where outhouse-style bathroom facilities are shared. Luxuries here come in one-of-a-kind experiences such as practicing yoga under the northern lights in a geodesic dome (billed as Alaska’s northernmost yoga studio). Or snowshoeing in powder with the help of sled dogs harnessed to hikers with a skijoring harness. “We stop often to take in the views, drink water and give the dogs love. It’s a blast,” says Busby. This winter’s packages include a winter solstice yoga retreat for women in December and five-day rewilding retreats in February and March. Skiers with experience beyond the world of chairlifts can challenge themselves with backcountry terrain around Prince William Sound on Alaska’s southern coast during adventurous small boat cruises for skiers aboard the 58-foot M/V Babkin or 42-foot fishing vessel, Alexandra. Remarkable Adventures organizes five-day (and longer) trips from late February into May with captains guiding the way to world-class backcountry skiing in the region’s mountainous islands and fjords. Guests sleep aboard the boat and can also enjoy fishing, kayaking and glacier-viewing along the way. Alyeska Resort in Girdwood, the state’s largest ski resort, is just a 45-minute drive east of Anchorage and the only ski resort in North America with mountain, glacier and ocean views. A steep and deep favorite among expert skiers and snowboarders, the property offers heli-skiing, cat-skiing and even a few beginner and intermediate runs in the surrounding Chugach Mountains and sees more than 640 inches of annual snowfall. After shredding Chugach terrain, the Alyeska Nordic Spa offers weary skiers hot and cold hydrotherapy pools, saunas and steam rooms at its indoor/outdoor 50,000-square-foot, adults-only wellness facility. At the uber-luxe Tordrillo Mountain Lodge, a fly-in property 60 miles northwest of Anchorage that accommodates a maximum of 20 guests, winter ski season runs from February through April. During seven-night heli-ski trips into the Tordrillo Mountains, slopeside views include volcanic summits and Denali itself. Among the lodge’s amenities are a cedar sauna, lakeside copper hot tub and 500 bottles of wine to peruse in the house wine cellar.",Travel
Heart-shaped beds and champagne hot tubs: Inside America’s adults-only hotels," Heart-shaped hot tubs surrounded by rose petals, circular beds with ceilings that replicate a starry night sky and jaw-dropping, seven-foot-tall champagne-glass whirlpools for two. Welcome to the Cove Pocono Resorts in Pennsylvania, once known as the “Honeymoon Capital of the World” thanks to its array of adults-only hotels and their quirky room features. From the moment married photographers Margaret and Corey Bienert stepped out of the car and into Pocono Palace – one of Cove Pocono Resorts’ three hotels – they were blown away. “I think to see something so over the top, and playful and fun, but also geared towards adults – I was in heaven because it felt so freeing,” Margaret tells CNN Travel. “It was truly just a very magical weekend. I couldn’t stop taking photos. And after we left I was like, ‘Okay, when are we going back?’” It wasn’t just the quirky rooms that sparked Margaret and Corey’s attention. It was the throwback ‘60s vibe – think organized games testing your knowledge of your partner and bowling competitions – as well as the bedazzled bars serving cocktails with “funny little sexy names,” as Margaret puts it. Rather than appearing outdated, the Cove Pocono Resorts’ retro vibe was appealing to the thirty-something Bienerts. Not only were they desperate to return, Margaret and Corey found themselves scouring the internet to find other similar spots up and down the country. And so was born a photo project, dubbed “A Pretty Cool Hotel Tour” that launched on Instagram, ballooned in popularity on TikTok and is now available to peruse in book form: “Hotel Kitsch: A Pretty Cool Tour of America’s Fantasy Getaways” via Artisan Books. The Cove Pocono Resorts premiered its heart-shaped hot tub in 1963. Colored a vibrant red and surrounded by walls of mirrors, as the decade went on the heart-shaped tub became a symbol of a new, more risqué era. In 1971, the heart shaped tub featured in a two page spread in Life magazine: a photo of a couple mid-kiss, mid-hot tub soak was accompanied by text questioning whether tub represented “a surfeit of affluent vulgarity?” Soon hotels up and down the country were copying the design, which Poconos hotel owner and tub designer Morris Wilkins had failed to patent. Rather than being disheartened, Wilkins set about one-upping himself. In 1984, he debuted a towering whirlpool designed to replicate a coupe champagne glass. He made sure to patent it and suites offering the champagne hot tub soon had a year-long waiting list. When Margaret and Corey turned up at Cove Pocono Resorts almost four decades later, they were met with some modernized and renovated spaces, but the key features that made the resorts famous remained intact. Margaret says she initially thought the champagne tub was “hilarious” but then she took a self-portrait with Corey where they’re sitting in the tub embracing. The resulting image leans more into the romance than the cheese. For Margaret and Corey, these images of the champagne tub became the thesis statement of their hotel project. They embarked on a hunt for destinations that were similarly “ultra playful, romantic, adults-only,” as Margaret puts it. The goal was finding spots that simultaneously “don’t take themselves seriously at all and fully lean into what they’re offering.” At the 1980s-built Gallery Holiday Motel in South Amboy New Jersey, the couple were met with mirrored-ceilings aplenty, velvet upholstery, heart-shaped tubs – but also a jungle-themed room and a beach suite. At the Californian Victorian Inn, they discovered a vintage car bed. In the ‘90s-built Anniversary Inn, which has locations in Idaho and Utah, there’s a bathtub with an imposing phoenix rising from the ashes overhead. They soon learned that heart shaped beds are difficult to sleep in. And quirky, themed chairs aren’t always especially comfy. Tracking down the power sockets often proved tricky. Not all the hotels Margaret and Corey frequent are 20th century relics. At the Designer Inn and Suites in Toledo, Iowa – redecorated in the early 2000s – the couple discovered the “Heart’s Delight” room, featuring a velvet-cupid-embossed bed with pink-heart-shaped mirrors on the ceiling. They also enjoyed checking out the pink paradise of the Trixie Motel, which debuted in 2022 and was designed by drag queen Trixie Mattel of “Ru Paul’s Drag Race” fame. Under-the-sea themed rooms complete with clam shell beds at the Best Western in Galena, Illinois were another highlight. When Margaret and Corey discovered these rooms, they realized even chain hotels, at least those run by creative franchise owners, can have the odd quirky room or two. “They can’t use the themed rooms in advertising or any promotional material,” explains Margaret. “Sometimes they call them ‘secret’ rooms. Those are always fun to discover.” There are similarities between most of the hotels featured on Margaret and Corey’s social media and in the book, but there are occasional spots that might seem less obvious. While Margaret and Corey generally gravitate towards adult-only spaces, some of the hotels they feature – such as Wildwood Inn in Florence, Kentucky, home to a windowless, “arctic cave” room –  are family-friendly and kids are welcome too. Some of the spaces are more unconventional interpretations of the concept of a hotel – think Love Cloud, a small airplane fitted out with a red-sheeted bed, or Don Q Inn in Wisconsin which includes a converted airplane that stays on the ground, but also offers an outer space-themed room and an Arctic-themed room with a surprise polar bear experience. Margaret says the couple’s goal has always been for their “hearts to lead us to wherever we should go.” Many of the hotels they cover – despite being eminently Instagrammable – predate the ubiquity of cell phones. They’re not splashed over social media, they’re often not even particularly well advertised. To find potential places to visit, Margaret and Corey rely on tracking down designers and asking them for lists of hotels they’ve worked on. They also get word of mouth recommendations from social media users. People comment, “My parents honeymooned at a place with a heart-shaped bed” under a social media post, and Margaret quizzes them on the exact location. Then she and Corey map out the destinations on maps and embark on mammoth US road trips. Wherever they head, Margaret and Corey both bring their cameras in tow. It was a shared love of photography that bonded them back when they first met at college and while their styles usually diverge, for this project, the two share a firm creative vision. “Early on, we were both fascinated and focused on different elements,” explains Corey. “And then, as we’ve been doing the project for so long, now we have sort of an in-house style.” As well as photos, Margaret and Corey also capture film footage. Video helps them capture the scale of the suites – and allows them to give guided tours and explain the quirky touches in the rooms. For example, anyone wondering about the mechanics behind the floating champagne hot tub can check out Margaret’s social media explainer. “It’s actually an optical illusion,” Margaret tells CNN Travel. “Behind the tub are mirrors, and it’s not actually standing on the stem. So you walk up behind the tub up to the second floor and step down into the tub. It’s sticking out from the wall, but it’s actually sitting on the second floor.” “There’s also a normal shower in the room too, so it’s not your only form of bathing,” adds Corey. While Margaret and Corey occasionally poke affectionate fun at the hotels they visit, it’s always with a sense of reverence and appreciation. They insist calling the hotels “kitsch” in their book title is a compliment, not an insult. After all, says Margaret, there’s “an intentionality to the fun aspect of it – the silly aspect of it.” The more research they do, the more hotels they see, the more she and Corey are sure of that. “Owners wanted that really lighthearted aspect to romance – giving you a fun experience that kind of spoke to your childhood self, the very Disneyland aspects of these rooms – but saying this is for you and your adult life, for you and your romantic partner,” says Margaret. For Margaret, an interesting byproduct of the project is how it’s challenged her conservative Christian upbringing. She and Corey both grew up in Evangelical households, where Margaret says “any form of sexuality is such a hot button issue.” Margaret says she felt that particularly keenly as a woman. “There had never been a time in my life where I felt very comfortable or invited to be a sexual person at all,” reflects Margaret. While Margaret and Corey have distanced themselves from this religious upbringing, Margaret says embarking on this project and visiting these adults-only hotels – including a stop off at swingers hotel Mon Chalet in Colorado – “has really challenged a lot of my views of myself.” “Going to adults-only spaces that were playful, very lighthearted, invited me into a space that I hadn’t been invited into before,” she says. For Margaret, this gets to the crux of the series: “I’ve enjoyed giving more and more people permission to be who they want to be and romantically find what works for them,” she says. “And whether or not you’re with a partner, find ways to express yourself and feel like yourself, and whether that’s sexually or in other ways, because again, even just the design of these places can really challenge you.” While most of the hotels Margaret and Corey highlight are in the US, the book also spotlights a few elsewhere in the world. In Ibiza, Spain the recently opened Romeo’s Motel & Diner was inspired by old school American hotels. Margaret and Corey say the designer, Diego Calvo, reached out to them on social media to let them know many of their photographs were on his moodboard. Margaret and Corey were flattered. Then, when they went to visit the Spanish hotel and saw the heart-shaped tubs and vibrant decor, they fell in love with the space. The experience also got them thinking about the future of kitsch, themed hotels – where once they seemed tacky or outmoded, many young people today find their fading glamor appealing and intriguing. It helps that they pop on social media, but it’s also, suggests Margaret, about people realizing how fun these unexpected spaces can be. “How often are you going to go into a room that takes you into a completely different world, and gives you a very specific experience that might make you laugh, might make you uncomfortable?” she says. “It is something about just giving a couple a different environment that they’re not used to that can be such a memorable experience.”",Travel
Beyond suites: Where does business class innovate next?," For the last half-decade, the ultimate innovation in business class has been privacy. Passengers overwhelmingly tell airlines they want it, and airlines — working with the designers and seatmakers who create their seats — are delivering it in the form of sliding doors that create the latest kind of business class seat: the doored mini-suite. If you haven’t flown in one, the basic idea is that a small door (or sometimes two) slides forward or backward to block off your own little suite seat in its sleeping pod from the rest of the cabin. In most cases, the crew can still see you when they’re walking past, but when seated you aren’t making eye contact with anyone else, and you can get some work done or just relax in privacy. Only a very few airlines have eschewed doors, and even those that were initially opposed to the concept have changed course. Virgin Atlantic is a case in point: the 2019 launch of its no-door Airbus A350 cabin emphasized that the designers thought doors didn’t fit with Virgin’s concept of a “social airline,” but fast-forward to 2022, and the latest Airbus A330neo cabin has, you guessed it, doors. Here’s the thing, though: doors are heavy and they’re complex — both in terms of manufacturing and in terms of the crew serving you food and beverages. They have some serious crash safety certification requirements, and they take up a relatively large amount of cabin space at a point where every inch matters. When CNN Travel asked Matt Round, chief creative officer at aviation design firm Tangerine, about how airlines could innovate, his first response was, “No doors! Doors surrender personal space. The extra space will give designers a wider canvas to design on — more space for people and less space for hardware.” Chris Brady, founder and chief executive officer of seatmaker Unum, concurs. “Overall, it seems like we’re due a kind of ‘less is more’ pendulum swing, moving away from inelegant prescriptive features, allowing us to minimize weight and meet sustainability targets.” Minimizing the weight of an intricate door mechanism with extensive safety regulations is a big ask. Airplane safety rules mean that each business class mini-suite must have two ways to get out in the event that the door itself can’t open after an incident. Normally, one of those is a fairly complicated mechanism that will either allow the escaping passenger to remove the interior door panel or to take the door off entirely. The other is usually the much simpler option of climbing over the seat ahead or behind. At the end of the day, Brady says, “where airlines and their passengers really do want doors, we’re going to have to create ‘Doors 2.0,’ answering the question of how to solve the door issue that has been created where we have complicated mechanisms that can be challenging to certify.” This might include exchanging heavy doors for another privacy option. KLM’s most recent business class seat, manufactured by Japanese seatmaker Jamco, includes a retractable privacy screen in a semi-rigid material. Imagine a rolling window blind, turned on its side, that you pull forward and attach using a magnetic section. With or without doors — and most seatmakers are offering the option to airlines at this point — there are many new and exciting things coming down the line for business class passengers in the near future, some of which are also coming for premium economy and economy. Daniel Baron, managing director of LIFT Aero Design in Tokyo, explains that “the physical spaces in business class are delivering much higher levels of comfort and control than the generation before them. Airlines have reached certain limits in seat geometry and real estate usage. The next phase of enhancements will be more sensory in nature, such as personal mood lighting and scents within the ‘cocoon zone,’ headrests with integrated audio, and innovative textures on materials.” This cocooning concept is a big trend outside the cabin, and many designers are emphasizing it as something that travelers will expect inside their business class seat or suite as well. Comforting natural materials, soft surfaces and textures — eclipsing the usual hard-wearing seat fabric and beige plastic structures — are a strong part of the design of the next generation of seats. Integrated audio is a big deal, with the early part of this technology toolkit being the ability to connect your own wireless headsets to the seat control using Bluetooth. Unum’s Chris Brady predicts that “we’ll see more widespread integration of passengers’ personal electronic devices, potentially enabling more human-centric controls, as well as improved user interfaces on seat control. The end goal might well be something like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in the Air.” More advancements will occur in how the seats themselves make you feel, both mentally and physically. With seats having more and more ambient light around them thanks to side lamps and LED feature lighting strips, airlines have the option to adjust the ambient lighting in your seat area to subconsciously help you adjust to the phase of flight. It’s beyond the old-school lighter-is-morning and darker-is-bedtime options: now they’re able to change the warmth of the light, sort of like how your phone or tablet switches almost imperceptibly from blue light in the daytime to a warmer beige light after sunset. On the plane, that can help you adjust to your new time zone and reduce jetlag. Within the seat itself, says Unum’s Brady, “I think we’ll see more sophistication in seat mechanisms, with a focus on comfort experience rather than features — for example, allowing micro-adjustments to relieve fatigue.” Zero-gravity seats, where there’s an option to cradle yourself a bit like an astronaut, are on the way, spreading from first class suites to business class seats. These seats change the comfort game — it’s the difference between sitting in an armchair with a legrest and sitting in a La-Z-Boy style recliner where you can lie back with all the pressure taken off your body. “Also coming to business class seats,” suggests Lift’s Daniel Baron, “is temperature control that matches what is now available in some luxury cars. In an age where every premium traveler is flying flat, airlines are hoping that such sensory bells and whistles will help them increase brand affinity.” That temperature control, with either heating or cooling delivered to the foot area and through the seat cushioning, will be ideal for anyone who gets chilly in the air — or indeed who finds that crews, whose workstations are right next to draughty doors, tend to keep the thermostat a few degrees higher than they might prefer. More widely in the passenger experience, Matt Round from Tangerine also highlights that airlines are attempting to make your time on board more personal and customizable, but that there are inherent constraints since premium cabins are growing larger and the crew-to-passenger ratio can’t economically be like that of a very personalized first class service. Here, he notes, airlines have been focusing on delivering choices and unique options to passengers — in meals, entertainment, and other amenities. That will increase as business class seating options become more numerous: Lufthansa hopes to be able to sell passengers seven different types of seat in business class when it installs its forthcoming Allegris seats, with the ones offering more privacy or suite doors more expensive. Yet people often want to make the choice based on how they’re feeling on the day in their seat, rather than choosing things like in-flight meals days or weeks in advance. Inherently, that’s a tricky problem to solve. It’s a human social psychology challenge rather than a technical seat manufacturing issue. As seats become more complex, and as our wants and needs as passengers change, airlines will have to focus more and more on passenger psychology in addition to the technology.",Travel
One of Japan’s most elegant hotels is actually a treehouse," Some little kids dream of building a treehouse. But one Japanese man turned his childhood dream into an adult reality. Growing up in Tokyo, Satoru Kikugawa frequently visited the family summer home in the countryside, where he learned to appreciate nature. A Japanese children’s book called “I Want a Big Tree” sparked the dream of having a treehouse one day. However, it wasn’t until decades later that a family trip to Borneo brought urgency and the push to make that dream a reality. As Kikugawa explains it, he was flying over the island when he saw a large forest cut down and turned into a palm plantation. “I understand economically that selling lumber brings a stable income, but this impacts carbon levels and the diversity in wildlife. So I thought about how we can save the environment that can still provide income for the locals,” says Kikugawa. It was the first seed of what is now Treeful, an upscale resort in Okinawa prefecture. There was just one problem – Kikugawa had absolutely no idea how to build a treehouse. By day, he worked as the chairman of Gala, Inc, a company that creates role-playing video games, among other projects. He turned to YouTube and began watching instructional videos. It took years, plus plenty of trial and error. He had to teach himself how to use a circular saw and other carpentry tools. Kikugawa was able to buy some land in forested Okinawa. But instead of choosing the location and then cutting down a tree, he walked around until he saw the right tree, which he hugged. From there, he began to build the house around it. “I didn’t get much support initially when I had this [treehouse] idea,” Kikugawa says. “Many saw me as just a rich man looking to find a hobby.” But there was someone who believed in Kikugawa’s idea – his daughter Maha. She tells CNN that her father instilled a love of nature in her from childhood. Maha went on to major in ecosystem science and policy at the University of Miami. Then, she accompanied her dad on trips to Costa Rica and the US to visit similar treehouse projects. Kikugawa completed the first of his structures, Spiral Treehouse, in 2014. It became the first part of what is now Treeful. “I look up to my father and his passion for making the world a better place though treehouses,” Maha tells CNN Travel. “From an early age, my father taught me the importance of nature. Now we are working together through this sustainable treehouse resort to protect it and send a message to others on its values.” Now, there are four treehouses at this resort, each built to ensure as little disturbance to the environment as possible. One, the AeroHouse, was built 1.2 meters above ground level to protect the local wildlife habitat. Wooden dowels were used instead of metal bolts, and rooms have composting toilets. Well water is sterilized with ultraviolet light, avoiding the use of chlorine. The floors and ceiling are made of shredded wood so the sunlight can still flow through the treehouse and provide energy to the plants that lie underneath, avoiding disruption to the ecosystem. In-room decor, like lamps and bookshelves, is also made with stones and branches that have fallen naturally from the forest. And Donna, the resort goat, keeps the grass maintained. Seven years after Kikugawa started building a treehouse, the resort opened in 2021. Since then, it has won several design awards and recognition from Guinness World Records for having the world’s lowest treehouse, clocking in at “3.6 m (11 ft 9 in) below the base of the host tree.” But Treeful’s founder has visions beyond his native Japan. Kikugawa is working with the Cambodian government on a project to build treehouses inside Phnom Kulen National Park near Siem Reap. It’s one of several initiatives aimed at combatting illegal logging. From 2016 to 2021, Cambodia has lost more than 38,000 hectares of forest – nearly 9%, forcing USAID to end its forest protection program after over $100 million dollars in investment. “I want to grow this business and take it international,” says Kikugawa. Visiting Treeful requires planning ahead. It’s a 90-minute drive from Okinawa’s Naha Airport (OKA), or three hours by bus (with one transfer) from the town of Genkawa Iriguchi. The Treeful staff advises getting there before sunset, as they don’t use artificial lights and the forest can get quite dark.

The parents hiking America’s longest trails with five kids," Taking on three of the most remote and rugged long-distance trails of America would be a challenge for any hiker.Taking on three of the most remote and rugged long-distance trails of America would be a challenge for any hiker. But attempting to hike them with several young children in tow – well that’s a completely different ball game. However, the Netteburgs have managed to do just that. Made up of Danae and Olen Netteburg, both 44, and their five children Lyol, 14, Zane, 12, Addison, 10, Juniper, eight, and Piper, two, the family of hikers from the US, have just completed North America’s holy hiking trinity, the Triple Crown, which covers almost 8,000 miles (around 12,900 kilometers). The  Netteburgs, who previously hiked the Appalachian Trail, which stretches over nearly 2,200 miles (3,540 kilometers) between Georgia and Maine, and the Continental Divide Trail, a 3,028-mile (4,873-kilometer) trail extending from New Mexico to the Canadian border in Montana, finished the Pacific Crest Trail in early November. It took them just under six months to trek the 2,653-mile (4,270-kilometer) trail extending from the border of Mexico through California, Oregon, and Washington to Canada, and the Netteburgs say they feel very lucky to be able to hike these iconic trails as a family. “We realize, a lot of people can’t do it,” Danae told CNN Travel back in August. “They [either] don’t have the time or money or they don’t want to. So we’re very blessed.” Danae and Olen, who are both physicians, met at medical school in 2003 and married around three years later. In 2010, the couple relocated to Chad, a landlocked country in north-central Africa, to run a medical practice and went on to have their children, who were all born in the US. While the pair had gone on a few backpacking trips together over the years, including a visit to the Canadian Rockies after they got married, it wasn’t until Juniper, their fourth child, was aged around two that they decided to attempt an extensive trail as a family. “They [the older children] were two, four, six, and nine at the time,” explains Olen. “That summer we did four separate week-long trips – and the kids didn’t hate it. They seemed to enjoy it. “They liked camping, catching salamanders, campfires and all the rest.” The first route they tackled was the West Rim Trail, a 30.5-mile (49-kilometer) hike that runs along the western side of the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon. Feeling encouraged by their children’s enthusiasm, they went on to hike the Uintas Highline Trail, a remote path through the high country of the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah. “That [the Uintas] was high elevation and kind of sketchy weather. So it was sort of a big trip,” adds Olen. “And the kids even enjoyed that one. So we kept doing it.” After another successful family hike, they decided to “go for broke and do the Appalachian Trail” in early 2020. “We thought we would just try it for a month to see if we could keep going or if anybody hated it, or whatever,” explains Danae. “We didn’t know how it would go. But it turns out, that was a difficult year for everybody.” Shortly after they started walking the trail, which stretches along the Appalachian Mountains from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine, the Covid-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic and restrictions were put in place throughout many countries around the world. “Various places in America [were] closed in various ways at various times,” says Olen. “So everywhere we would go, we had to make sure that it was legal and safe.” The Netteburgs admit that they weren’t sure whether they’d be able to finish the challenging trail, but felt more and more confident as time went on and their kids were able to reach certain milestones. “It was kind of a big moment when the kids did like an 11.3-mile (18.1-kilometer) day,” says Olen. In order to keep their children motivated, they asked them to strike the pose they wanted to make in the photo that they’d all take once they’d completed the Appalachian Trail, and told them to keep practicing it along the way. “When you hike with kids, you have to hype it up a lot,” explains Danae. The couple say it took the six of them around seven months to reach the end of the trail, and by the final week, they were excitedly discussing which journey they’d take on. “We started reading some articles online to the kids about the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail,” says Olen. “And the kids actually started to get kind of excited. And we chose the Continental Divide Trail to be the next one.” While hikers attempting the Triple Crown tend to do the Pacific Crest Trail after the Appalachian Trail and finish with the Continental Divide Trail, Olen explains that their kids “wanted the hardest one.” “We figured if we only got to do one more after the AT, we wanted to challenge ourselves,” he adds. “Also, the idea of less crowds appealed to us.” Although they’d hoped to begin as soon as they could, the Netteburgs had no choice but to put their plans on hold when they discovered that they were expecting their fifth child. Their youngest daughter, Piper, was born in June 2021. Once things had settled down, they began reading up on “everything about having a baby in the wilderness” in order to be able to take on the Continental Divide Trail with their newborn. They used elimination communication, the practice of identifying your child’s bathroom cues at an early stage, to toilet train Piper as early as possible. “A lot of people do it. I just didn’t know about it,” says Danae. The family also opted to “pare down” their camping equipment in order to make room for all of the extra stuff they’d have to carry, including an extra sleeping bag, as well as “extra clothes and food and all the rest,” now that they had a baby along with them. “It really added a great deal of complexity into the hike,” says Olen. They set off with their new addition, who they nicknamed “dead weight,” and the rest of the children in March 2022. But having to carry a newborn along with them didn’t slow this hiking family down at all. In fact, they were able to complete Continental Divide Trail in six months, a month less time than the Appalachian Trail had taken them. “And it was farther too,” says Olen, before noting that they were able to “cover a lot more ground” due to their kids being slightly older this time. “So we went farther and faster.” Of course, hiking with five children comes with its challenges. The couple use various different tactics to motivate their young ones while on the trail. For instance, Olen has memorized all of the songs from the soundtrack of Disney’s “Frozen,” and says that  bringing about an impromptu singalong to “Let It Go” while going up a mountain can make all the difference when it comes to how fast the kids are moving. “Kids really want their parents’ undivided attention,” he notes. “And when you’re hiking, you have the opportunity to do that a lot better. There’s no cell phone signal, there’s no anything else to distract you.” Once they’d successfully completed the Continental Divide Trail in late 2022, the family were determined to achieve the Triple Crown by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. During their first mammoth trails, the couple took sabbaticals from work, while their older children, who are all home-schooled, worked hard to “get ahead” before the trip in order to be able to take the time out. “Them working very hard in school has made it possible for us to do this,” explains Olen. But after over a decade working in Chad, Danae and Olen left their medical practice earlier this year to move back to the US full time. “We’d been there for 12 years, except for the two years that we took a break to do the hikes,” explains Danae. “So it was time for a new person to take over.” While they plan to settle down and begin making plans for the future at some stage, the family decided to first move ahead with their next big goal – the Pacific Crest Trail. They started the trail in May, setting off from near Big Bear, California, and made good progress initially. However, things proved to be incredibly difficult this year due to the amount of snow in California, and the Netteburgs had to move around a lot to avoid the dangerous snow areas. “They’ve had like more than three times their average snowfall,” explains Olen. “That really threw a massive wrench into things for everybody. Not just for us, but everybody.” The couple point out that having their kids with them meant that they had to be even more cautious when it came to making decisions about the areas to potentially avoid. “Our kids are little,” adds Danae. “They’re definitely not fragile. But we have to take care of them. “So they’re relying on us to not put them in a dangerous situation. And most people just have themselves to worry about.” When the family met other hikers along the trail, they’d often ask them about their “zero days,” where hikers take a break from walking to do their laundry or stock up on food. According to Olen, his and Danae’s “zero days” could actually be harder than their hiking days, as they have “all these kids with pent up energy that they have to work out.” Meanwhile, feeding seven people while on the proved to be pretty costly, while carrying around that much food meant that they had a heavier load. The family used a mini van, Olen’s dad’s 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan, packed with “over 200 pounds of gear and often several weeks of food,” to move from different hiking areas and arranged for family and/or friends to move it along the trail for them. Although they’ve received some free or discounted gear from a number of companies, they’ve funded the hikes themselves. Danae and Olen are incredibly proud of their children, who have learned a great deal from being out in the wilderness. “We’re seeing animals like bears and moose – I saw a mountain lion,” says Danae. “Just lots of neat things. “The kids are looking at the trees and the flowers and really studying them, wondering what they are.” The older children have been listening to classic literature such as Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities” and Lucy Maud Montgomery’s “Anne of Green Gables” while hiking, and the family try to fit in regular verbal spelling and math quizzes with the younger ones on the go. “We’re hoping that the kids take from this, a sense of our family coming closer together,” says Olen. “And also a sense that no matter what comes, they’ve accomplished a hard thing. And when something seems hard, there’ll be one of the few children to have hiked 7,000 miles.” On November 4, the family finally reached their finish line, the border of Mexico. “We’ve all had the best experience,” Danae told CNN Travel shortly after they’d completed the trail. The Netteburgs have registered their previous hikes with long distance hiking organizations Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association (ALDHA) and the Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC,) and plan to log their Triple Crowns with American Long Distance Hiking Association-West (ALDHA-West). They were recently invited to attend next year’s annual ALDHA-West Gathering in recognition of their “crowns.” Now that they’ve ticked the Triple Crown off their to-do list, Danae and Olen say they’d love to buy a sailboat, or convert a school bus into a motorhome and set off on another adventure with their children. But for the time being, the family are making the most of not having to walk for miles every day, and hope to pay a visit to Disneyland, as well as catch up with their friends, in the coming days. Although they have no plans to do another trail for a while, Danae and Olen say they’ve discussed attempting one outside of the US, such as the Camino de Santiago in Spain, or the Tongariro Alpine Crossing in New Zealand. However, the couple are mindful that their kids will “probably need real school” at some point, and once they both begin working again, they may need to stay in one place, wherever that may be. “Real life is a bummer,” jokes Olen.",Travel
An Italian ski resort shut down by climate change plans to reopen with artificial snow. Not everyone is happy," There are few things Italians do better than dreaming big against the odds. Take the multi-million-dollar plan that’s been in the works since the 1990s to build the world’s longest suspension bridge across the Straits of Messina in the heart of Mafia land. Or the very existence of the city of Venice, built on a lagoon system that’s now better protected from extreme weather by mechanical flood gates that took more than 20 years to realize. Now, plans to build a multi-million-dollar ski facility on a snowless northern Italian mountain may prove equally challenging. The bald mountain is the Monte San Primo, a gorgeous 1,682 meter (5,518 foot) promontory that accounts for much of the landscape view from the north end of Lake Como. The quaint cobblestone city of Bellagio, at its base, is known as the “pearl” of the lake for beauty that has lured A-list celebs (and wealthy Russians), who own the majority of lavish villas nearby. But ever since the city of Bellagio last year won the backing of the national and regional government to fund a ski area project that it hopes will lure winter tourists, there has been trouble in this mountain paradise. The plan, priced at 5 million euros (about $5.4 million), would see the construction of a large parking lot, toboggan runs and new lifts in an area that was a thriving ski destination 50 years ago, but closed a decade ago to winter sports as temperatures rose and snowfalls thinned. While there has been considerable local support from those who think that reviving the mountain’s ski infrastructure will bring in vital tourism dollars, the plans have received an icy reception from environmental and sporting organizations. A consortium of 33 groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Italian Alpine Club, which calls itself “Let’s Save Monte Primo,” has been trying to halt the project and raise awareness about the mountain’s ecological fragility. Roberto Fumagalli, a spokesperson for the group, insists there are better ways to inject 5 million euros into the area that will still bring in tourism revenues. He says the group has been trying in vain to engage in talks with the project’s backers, including 31 local councils. “We don’t want to wait until we are out protesting the bulldozers,” Fumagalli told CNN. “It would be more productive to sit down now.” The group has a number of concerns about the proposed plans that run the gamut from environmental to logistical. Instead of revamping the parking lot, its members insist it would be more ecological to invest in public transportation; instead of artificially restoring snow areas, they would like to see hiking trails enhanced since shorter winters mean a longer hiking season. They are also concerned about energy consumption by the snow-making machines, damage to the mountain caused by bringing in heavy equipment, and whether, given the proximity to better ski areas, the investment could eventually become a burden to local taxpayers if the project doesn’t eventually pay for itself. Fumagalli said the protest group could be willing to find a compromise, but only if the project’s supporters are willing to have a dialogue. “We’ve sent registered letters, appeals, used social media, and no one ever responds,” he added. The group even wrote to Lake Como’s most famous resident, Hollywood star George Clooney. “He hasn’t responded, but we hope he will,” Fumagalli said, pointing out how when flooding lapped up against Clooney’s property in 2021, the star spoke out in support of the community over the damage. The main problem, the protest group points out, is that Monte San Primo, despite its history as a ski destination, just doesn’t get enough snow now. That’s thanks to rising temperatures and droughts, which the climate crisis might make more severe and more frequent. The mountain, which has become a year-round hiking destination, is a graveyard of former efforts to capitalize on more traditional winter pursuits. Old turnstiles, ski lift pillars, and even a map of now-vanished pistes can still be found on the mountain. The last lifts closed in the early 2010s because annual snow accumulations just couldn’t support a ski season, especially so close to the Alps and Dolomite ranges, where snow is guaranteed. Snow could become even more scarce in the future as the impacts of the climate crisis accelerate. A recent study by the non-governmental organization WaterAid and the UK’s Cardiff and Bristol universities found that extreme drought in northern Italy has doubled over the past two decades, punctuated by severe flooding, putting it on course for a climate similar to those experienced in parts of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. “Both regions are facing increasing evaporation (most likely driven by higher regional temperatures) which leads to accelerated drying of the landscape between rainfall events,” the research points out. Not exactly ski weather. The threat of water shortages hasn’t dissuaded officials in Bellagio city and the surrounding Lombardy region, who say they will just build an artificial lake, fill it with water, and then draw from it to make artificial snow with snow cannons, according to the plans approved by the municipality seen by CNN. As well as the parking lot, toboggan runs and new lifts, the project includes the refurbishment of a long-abandoned hotel. A “magic carpet” conveyor belt lift is also planned. Supporters say this would have less environmental impact as foundations wouldn’t need to be dug deep into the landscape, as they are with traditional lifts. The artificial lake, they argue, would serve the community in the summer, too, and act as a reservoir for rainfall. Bellagio’s mayor, Angelo Barindelli, has warned supporters not to be “afraid” of naysayers. “It is an important agreement, a total investment of 5 million euros, now we just have to commit to getting it started quickly,” he said in a statement provided by his office. Alessandro Fermo, the head of the Lombardy Regional Council, which also backs the plans, said protesters are out of line. “It’s not my habit to contribute to controversies, but this time I can’t help myself,” he said recently in comments streamed on Facebook. “Bringing resources to the territory is a long and tiring job. An investment of 5 million euros is important to develop and relaunch the tourist attractiveness of the area in winter and in summer.” Even if the city fathers won’t sit with the protesters to find a compromise, the project may never get off the ground due to infamous Italian bureaucracy that, if history is a guide, can slow down even the most optimistic plans by decades. The first plans for the Monte San Primo ski area were passed and the money pledged in early 2022. The first bids were supposed to go out in November of last year. To date, nothing has moved forward beyond the protests and the weather forecast, which does not include significant snow any time soon.",Travel
American Airlines reviewing viral video showing wheelchair crashing onto airport tarmac," American Airlines said it is reviewing a video posted on TikTok that shows a baggage handler releasing a passenger’s wheelchair to slide down a jet bridge chute, where it crashed into a metal barrier, flipped over and tumbled onto an airport tarmac. The post, which has millions of views, has brought renewed attention to the traveling plight of millions of disabled Americans. According to the Paralyzed Veterans of America nonprofit, more than 31 wheelchairs were damaged, delayed or lost each day by airline workers between 2019 and 2022. The user who posted the TikTok video, Haeley Dyrdahl, said she recorded the incident Sunday at Miami International Airport “after I saw them do this and laugh with the first two wheelchairs.” She told CNN she also saw a suitcase get the same treatment. In the video, as the first man lets the wheelchair go, a second baggage handler, who is on the ground at the other end of the chute and wearing an American Airlines vest, steps back. The wheelchair slides down, strikes the barrier and flips over. The handler then loads the wheelchair onto a baggage cart. It’s unclear if the wheelchair was damaged. For those who use wheelchairs, arriving at an airport only to learn an essential tool for mobility has been damaged can be a real nightmare. Dyrdahl told CNN she often works with wheelchair users through her job and has had many families “express concerns with how their wheelchair would be handled during travel.” “After seeing this happen firsthand a couple times in a row, I was very sad to learn just how valid their concerns are,” she said. American Airlines said in a statement, “We recognize how important it is to support the independence of customers with disabilities by ensuring the proper care of mobility devices throughout their journey with us. This visual is deeply concerning and we are gathering more details so that we can address them with our team. We will continue to work hard to improve our handling of assistive devices across our network.” The airline said it is working to improve training for employees handling mobility devices and installing wheelchair movers and lifts at airports with high mobility device traffic, which will help lower the risk of damage. It did not provide a timeline. In a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the incident was “totally unacceptable” and the department, which has published a bill of rights for disabled passengers, would investigate. In August 2023, American Airlines mishandled 226 wheelchairs and scooters – a rate of 2.24 per 100 they handled on planes, according to the most recent available data released by the Department of Transportation. Among 15 major US carriers, it ranked 13th, according to the data. The data is trending in the wrong direction for the airline. In 2022, American Airlines’ rate of damaging, delaying or losing wheelchairs and scooters was 2.00 per 100, DOT statistics show. In September, the DOT announced United Airlines would “roll out a flight filter on its booking engine to make it easier for passengers who use wheelchairs to find flights where their wheelchairs can fit and be safely transported” as part of an agreement with the department. The DOT also said it was laying the groundwork for a potential policy that would give passengers the ability to stay in their wheelchairs on flights. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who uses a wheelchair, called the video “shocking, but not surprising based on my own travel experiences or those of anyone who relies on a mobility device to live their lives fully.” “Since I passed a law requiring public disclosure of how often airlines damage mobility devices, data shows that far too many wheelchair users land at their destinations only to find their wheelchairs broken, often irreparably,” Duckworth said in a statement. “It’s completely unacceptable to treat critical medical devices like this.” In 2018, Duckworth authored the bill that requires the DOT to issue monthly reports on damage to wheelchairs and scooters, and she is continuing to work on federal legislation to improve travel for disabled passengers. In September, Duckworth and Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, introduced the Mobility Aids on Board Improve Lives and Empower All (MOBILE) Act to address challenges faced by passengers who use mobility aids. “Though DOT is currently required to report the number of wheelchairs damaged each month, it does not evaluate data on the frequency or types of damage to manual wheelchairs, power wheelchairs or scooters,” the statement from Duckworth and Thune -– both members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee -– said. The legislation would require the Secretary of Transportation to notify air carriers of proposed rulemaking that would require them to publish dimensions of cargo holds. It also calls on the agency to study whether it is possible for passengers to use wheelchairs in the main cabin. It also says, “If in-flight, in-wheelchair seating is determined to be technically feasible, (the secretary should) assess the economic and financial feasibility of accommodating passengers with their wheelchairs in the main cabin during flight.” Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, and Rep. Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican, introduced a similar bill in the House. CNN’s David Williams, Ross Levitt and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",Travel
Thanksgiving travel predicted to be busy on the roads and record-setting in the skies," This Thanksgiving travel period is expected to be the busiest in several years and a record-setter for air travel. In all, AAA forecasts there will be 55.4 million people traveling, including more than 49 million Americans driving, between the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 23) and the Sunday after the holiday. And the Transportation Security Administration is bracing for an all-time record number of passengers at America’s airports over the Thanksgiving travel rush. AAA’s estimates don’t even count the many Americans who are expected to travel days ahead of the five-day peak period. “The trend is that people are still traveling in very large volumes,” Aixa Diaz of AAA told CNN. “Post-pandemic, the demand for travel just continues to go up year after year, and this Thanksgiving is no exception.” AAA’s estimates make this the third-busiest Thanksgiving travel period in the more than two decades AAA has tracked it. This year ranks behind only 2019 and 2005 and is about 2% higher than last year. But that only tells part of the story. The total number of turkey day travelers is even larger thanks to new post-Covid work trends. Office workers freed from sitting in a cubicle daily might have the flexibility to make Thanksgiving a weeklong trip or return the following week. “Hybrid schedules and remote schedules have changed everything,” said Diaz of AAA.  “Now people can leave for holiday travel at different times.” Although departures might be staggered, Americans will be returning home en masse the Sunday after Thanksgiving. That will make it the busiest air travel day of the year, according to the aviation firm Cirium. It expects airlines to fly more than 3 million seats on 22,000 flights that day. AAA, which looks at a five-day holiday period, expects it to be the busiest Thanksgiving for air travel since 2005, with a nearly 7% increase over last year. In all, air carriers such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines expect to carry record-setting numbers of passengers over a nearly two-week period including the weekend before Thanksgiving and the Monday or Tuesday that follows Thanksgiving. The TSA is forecasting that its officers will screen 2.9 million people at airports nationwide on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, November 26. That number is higher than the 2.88 million people who were screened on June 30, 2023, the current high mark since the agency was founded more than 20 years ago. The peak airport traffic could come as key employees are asked to work without pay.  Current federal government funding expires about a week before Thanksgiving, and lawmakers have not put forward a plan to avert a shutdown. Transportation Security Administration officers and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers are among the employees expected to report for work without pay if the federal funding lapses. US airlines each measure their holiday travel period differently, but all are expecting eye-popping numbers. American said it expects its busiest Thanksgiving period ever, carrying a half million more passengers than last year. It expects to fly 7.8 million passengers over a 13-day period on more than 70,000 flights. United’s forecast calls for 5.9 million passengers flying on its planes over an 11-day surge period.  The airline said that since recovery from the pandemic, “the holiday travel period is getting longer and demand is less concentrated on peak days.” Delta said it will carry as many as 6.4 million passengers over a 12-day period.  In addition to the Sunday and Monday after Thanksgiving, the Friday before the holiday is also a peak day, the airline said. The longer travel window may make peak traffic windows – the Wednesday before and Sunday after Thanksgiving – less busy than they could be.  But AAA says that Wednesday afternoon is still the worst time to hit the roads, with traffic 80% higher in some areas, according to the traffic research firm INRIX. Interstate 5 near Seattle and the Baltimore-Washington parkway near the nation’s capital will see peak traffic Wednesday afternoon, according to the INRIX estimates.  It predicts traffic will peak Sunday afternoon on I-10 near Houston and on the Garden State Parkway near New York City. The best times to travel during the peak Thanksgiving period are on Wednesday morning and Sunday morning, AAA says. “I’m always a big fan of leaving on Thanksgiving morning itself,” said Diaz of AAA.  “The roads are certainly clearer on Thursday morning.” “And yes,” she said, “it shortens the amount of time that you’re at your destination, but it also shortens the amount of time you’re in transit.”",Travel
What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed," Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Awful weather. Holiday crunches. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled. It’s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time – or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not). A storm this week is snarling some Thanksgiving travel, which is expected to be the busiest in many years for air travel. Here’s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled. Days ahead of the now-infamous December 2022 bomb cyclone, many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee. When you know a major weather event is forecast, hop on those waiver offers quickly, said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms (that is seats and flights). As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there. “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Keyes. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.” Keyes told CNN Travel in an interview that you should sign up for airlines’ free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier’s app. You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That’s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up. Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country. Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do? Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk – and get ready to multitask while you’re in line. Fast is a key word here. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said. Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said. Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead. “Most US-based travelers aren’t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.” You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. “Scan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.” The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage. “Not all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn’t always easy,” it told CNN Travel in an email. “Airlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter are a great way to get in contact with an employee. If you do use Twitter to reach out, then it’s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor.” Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude. “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. They’ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. “Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.” He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.” Your agent can expedite things if you’ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you’ve been waiting. Be ready to explain what you want. If you’ve booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you’ll have to deal through them when there’s a cancellation. If the price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, “it makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies” when you booked via a third party. US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong. The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily. “The chances of getting a refund are high when it comes to canceled flights due to reasons other than weather. Airlines, however, will typically try to reroute passengers to other airlines first. If this is the case, we recommend calling the airline’s customer support line directly to explore all your options, instead of waiting in long lines for gate agents to help,” said Jeff Klee, the CEO of CheapAir.com, in an email. Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor. “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel. “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.” “If you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket, you are entitled to a cash refund, though that may not help you get to where you need to go,” Smith said. “As we all know, last-minute flights are very expensive.” What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city? “Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It’s not required by law,” Keyes said. They’re less likely to do it if it’s weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues. Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments. What you might get depends on the airline itself and the specific circumstances on why a flight was canceled. Get to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren’t likely to just be offered. Also, your credit card could be your friend in this situation. “The good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.” Smith said. “These travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight. Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries.” If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport. The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily. Stay safe. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous. Frustrating though it is to stay put, it’s always better to arrive late than not at all. Consider buying travel insurance, advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel. It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.” The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later. But keep it to the basics. “Airlines only pay for ‘reasonable’ expenses though, so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol, expensive meals or extravagant hotels. “ The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or “significant delay” and you choose not to travel. This is the policy regardless of the reason the airline cancels or delays the flight. However, what constitutes a “significant delay” remains open to interpretation. According to the DOT website, “it has not specifically defined what constitutes a ‘significant delay.’  Whether you are entitled to a refund depends on many factors – including the length of the delay, the length of the flight, and your particular circumstances. DOT determines whether you are entitled to a refund following a significant delay on a case-by-case basis.” Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said in an email to CNN Travel that flyers should try to avoid vouchers. “If travelers are denied boarding, they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher. If they do, they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation,” Pawliszyn said. “Of course, if the airline makes a compelling enough offer, they may prefer to take it.”",Travel
Light pole falls at Disneyland during high winds; 1 person sent to hospital and 2 others injured," One person was transported to a local hospital with “serious injuries” and two others were injured after a light pole fell at Disneyland Park on Monday morning, Sgt. Jon McClintock, public information officer with Anaheim Public Safety, told CNN. Anaheim Fire and Rescue responded to the Main Street area of Disneyland around 8:30 a.m. PT Monday to find a light pole had fallen and that three people were injured, he said. In addition to the person sent to the hospital, two other people were treated for minor injuries and released, McClintock said. It was not immediately clear what injuries the three people sustained. Officials believe the light pole fell over because of strong winds, he said. A wind advisory was issued early Monday morning by the National Weather Service for portions of Orange County, where the resort is located. The agency advised there would be winds between 30 to 40 miles per hour, with gusts of 65 miles per hour. CNN has reached out to Disneyland for comment. There are two theme parks at the resort – the original Disneyland Park, which opened in 1955, and Disney California Adventure Park, which opened in 2001.",Travel
"Philippines bans American traveler for life, accusing him of writing profanities on immigration form"," The Philippines has banned for life an American traveler whom it accused of writing “profane words” on a digital immigration form and being rude to immigration officers. Anthony Laurence, 34, was refused entry and put on a blacklist permanently following his allegedly “disrespectful” behavior, the Philippine Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco said in a statement last week. Laurence had flown into Ninoy Aquino International Airport in the capital city of Manila from Bangkok, Thailand, via an Air Asia flight on November 7, according to the statement. According to Philippine authorities, upon his arrival, he allegedly “showed disdain” toward one immigration officer when he was reminded to fill out an online travel form and tossed his passport and mobile phone at another. Laurence, who told CNN he is a property investor who lives in the country intermittently, disputes the immigration authority’s account. Immigration Commissioner Tansingco said in his statement that, “After verifying [Laurence’s information] in our system, the officer discovered that the passenger had keyed in a made-up address in the Philippines, did not include his full name, and inputted profane words in his entry.” He added that immigration officers had been advised to exercise maximum tolerance, but the foreign national had “overstepped his boundaries.” “Such behavior is not only disrespectful but also undermines the efficiency of the system,” the commissioner said. “Our agency is committed to ensuring a seamless experience to the traveling public. We expect all individuals to conduct themselves with respect and adhere to the established procedures. Any violation of these procedures will be dealt with firmly,” he added. But Laurence disputes that account, telling CNN that he had neither thrown anything nor raised his voice during the incident. He said he had sought help from the immigration officers but was turned away when he could not get the travel form on his phone to work correctly. He said he had made three failed attempts to fill out the form, then became frustrated and entered incorrect information in a bid to “quickly get through immigration” for his connecting flight to Cebu – and that on this attempt, the application went through. He did not respond to CNN’s questions about what he wrote on the form and whether it included any profanities. But he said, “I immediately apologized and the immigration officer wasn’t interested.” “I even hand-wrote an apology to the immigration officer which he wasn’t interested in as well,” Laurence added. Laurence said the Philippine authorities had overreacted and accused them of depriving him due process, adding that he was not given any official document informing him of the ban. “In fact, I learned much of the government’s position from the articles they published about me and not from them directly,” he said, referring to media reports about the encounter. He did not divulge whether he had plans to return to the Philippines, saying only that he would now have to divest himself of his property investments there. According to the immigration bureau, it has excluded and blacklisted 44 foreign nationals it deemed ‘disrespectful’ in 2023.",Travel
A cruise for Taylor Swift fans plans to set sail next year. But don’t expect Swift to be on it," Swifties are invited to set sail to the Bahamas next year on a four-night fan cruise from Miami. But Taylor Swift fans shouldn’t expect to see their idol aboard the ship, Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas. The cruise’s organizers, travel agents at Marvelous Mouse Travels, are careful to note several times on the event’s website that it is “not endorsed or affiliated with TASRM [Publishing] or Taylor Swift.” The voyage, dubbed “In My Cruise Era,” is scheduled to set sail from the Port of Miami on October 21, 2024, the day after Swift performs her last show in the city. “Join us as we celebrate all things Taylor, make new friends, dress up in our favorite eras, trade friendship bracelets, and enjoy everything this amazing ship has to offer!” the website says. Jessica Malerman, Nicole Rivera and Shelby Reyes are the Marvelous Mouse travel agents hosting the cruise. The website says they’re “besties and Taylor Fans too” as well as Royal Caribbean specialists. The cruise line’s Allure of the Seas ship has 2,748 staterooms, with capacity (at double occupancy) for 5,496 guests. It’s unclear from the event’s website how much of the ship is expected to be set aside for Taylor Swift fans. The agents behind the cruise did not immediately respond to CNN Travel’s request for more information. Royal Caribbean referred questions back to the travel agency. The details are still being worked out; the organizers say they’re working with Royal Caribbean on Taylor-related events each evening of the four-night voyage. Some proposed events, which are subject to change, are a themed dance party called “I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you” and themed karaoke under the title “Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly.” Royal Caribbean’s private island and Nassau in the Bahamas are the two ports of call. As of Thursday, the event’s website showed the boardwalk balcony rooms as sold out. Other stateroom types appear to be available. The staterooms are listed as requiring a $100 per person deposit. Prices range from $1,573 to $1,967 total for double occupancy. All guests under the age of 21 must be accompanied by an adult 21 or older, with limited exceptions. Swift’s ongoing “Eras” tour has sparked incredible demand since it kicked off in the spring, with many fans traveling to attend the sought-after shows. Recently, a postponed concert prompted an airline to waive change fees for fans who extended their stays in Buenos Aires.",Travel
Sub-Saharan Africa just hit 100 World Heritage Sites. UNESCO says that’s not enough," Supporters of Africa’s cultural and natural heritage recently had cause to celebrate. At the 45th session of the World Heritage Committee in September, UNESCO announced five new locations had joined the list of World Heritage Sites, taking sub-Saharan Africa’s total over 100 for the first time. Rwanda’s first two World Heritage Sites were named among 42 new entries worldwide. One, Nyungwe National Park, has a diverse topography including forests and peat bogs, and is home to the Eastern Chimpanzee, Golden Monkey and other endemic species. The other is a collection of sites in Nyamata, Murambi, Gisozi and Bisesero, memorializing the 1994 genocide that targeted Rwanda’s Tutsi population. Ethiopia’s 215,000-hectare (531,000-acre) Bale Mountains National Park, which includes the continent’s largest afro-alpine habitat, and Gedeo Cultural Landscape, home to 250,000 indigenous Gedeo people in the Eastern Highlands, were also inscribed on the World Heritage list, along with the Forest Massif of Odzala-Kokoua in the Republic of Congo, a vital habitat for the region’s forest elephants. But that good news was tempered by the understanding that the continent still has a long way to go when it comes to recognition of its heritage. Sub-Saharan Africa, home to 1.2 billion people, contains less than 10% of sites inscribed on the list. Moreover, Africa has a higher percentage of World Heritages sites in danger than any other continent, and 11 countries (Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia and South Sudan) do not have a single entry on the list. There are currently 1,199 World Heritage sites, benefitting from the conservation agreements and tourism that come with that status. UNESCO lists 103 of those sites in its Africa region, which does not feature Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia – countries that have a total of 42 World Heritage Sites – which UNESCO includes in its Arab States region. To qualify, a site must be of “outstanding universal value” and meet at least one of 10 criteria, such as representing “a masterpiece of human creative genius,” containing “superlative natural phenomena,” or bearing “exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared.” Africa is not lacking these. So why the historic underrepresentation? Lazare Eloundou Assomo, director of World Heritage, says multiple factors have contributed. One is that some nations were slow to ratify the 1972 World Heritage convention, allowing them to submit applications for World Heritage status. (Somalia, for example, only ratified the convention in 2020.) Another factor is a historic lack of expertise and capacity in some countries to identify and nominate prospective sites, he says. There’s also no escaping the fact the nomination process can be long and expensive. It takes at least two years for a site to go from nomination to inscription on the World Heritage list, says UNESCO, and can demand resources that some nations simply might not have at their disposal. To tackle these challenges, UNESCO has announced “Priority Africa,” a plan to boost identification and preservation across the continent between now and 2029. “This new strategy is bringing a new momentum,” says Eloundou Assomo, pointing to previous global initiatives to bring balance to the World Heritage list, dating back to 1994. “By 2025, we will make sure that most of the African countries that do not have a World Heritage Site have at least started preparing a nomination dossier,” he says, adding he hopes that every African nation currently without a site on the list will have one by the end of the decade. The World Heritage director – from Cameroon, and the first African to hold the position – says there are more local resources and expertise than ever before to help maintain heritage sites. UNESCO has also partnered with the African World Heritage Fund on a mentorship program to train professionals from a “younger generation, so that they can be the experts and caretakers of tomorrow,” says Eloundou Assomo. Another goal of the strategy is to work to reduce the number of African sites listed as “World Heritage in Danger.” Human conflict and natural disaster, urban development, poaching, pollution and unchecked tourism can all pose a threat, says UNESCO. Fifteen sites in UNESCO’s Africa tally are listed as in danger and UNESCO wants to work with its partners to halve that number by 2029. In positive news, one site in Uganda, the 19th century Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi, in Kampala, was recently removed from the in-danger list after a 13-year effort to restore their indigenous architecture after a fire ripped through the tombs in 2010. Eloundou Assomo says that even in the most challenging circumstances, “it is paramount to support African countries in their effort (to preserve their heritage).” “World heritage is considered part of the soul of nations and soul of communities,” Eloundou Assomo says. “Their destruction is the disappearance of some identity.” “If people protect (heritage sites), it helps people rebuild themselves … They have what defines them; because they know their past, they can build for the future,” he adds. The six-year mission from UNESCO is but the blink of an eye for some of the continent’s oldest and most venerated locations. While it is down to individual nations to submit applications for inclusion on the list, the director did let slip one place he’d like to see inscribed in the future: the Bissagos Islands. The archipelago off the coast of Guinea-Bissau is not only a biodiversity hotspot, it is also populated by a matriarchal society, and would become the nation’s first World Heritage Site. Eloundou Assomo stresses that countries should look broadly at what they might want to submit to UNESCO for consideration. “You don’t (need to) have an Eiffel Tower (to) propose a World Heritage Site,” he says. “It’s not only the monumental – there are a variety of sites everywhere in the world that have the potential to join the list.”",Travel
Plane turns back to JFK after horse escapes on board," A Boeing 747 en route from New York JFK to Liege, Belgium, was forced to turn around on November 9 after a horse got loose in the cargo hold. The horse, which partially escaped its stall while airborne, had to be euthanized due to the extent of its injuries, according to two people familiar with the episode. The cargo flight operated by charter airline Air Atlanta Icelandic had climbed to around 31,000 feet when the crew contacted Air Traffic Control in Boston to report that the horse had escaped. “We don’t have a problem (…) flying-wise,” one of the pilots says in a video reconstruction by YouTube channel “You Can See ATC,” but “we cannot get the horse back secured.” A representative from Air Atlanta Icelandic told CNN that the information in the “You Can See ATC” video is correct. The horse was among 15 being transported to Liege — an import hub for Europe — when turbulence struck shortly after takeoff, according to John Cuticelli, the head of the corporation responsible for operating animal quarantine and export at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The horse became spooked and jumped halfway over the high front barrier of the stall and became hung up, with his front legs on one side of the barrier and his hind legs trapped on the inside of the stall. “The horse jumped and managed to get its two front legs over the (front) barrier and then got jammed,” Cuticelli said. “It’s only the second time in all the years I’ve been doing this that I’ve ever seen that happen. And we do thousands of horses a year. A very unfortunate event — but that horse was spooked.” In the recordings, Air Traffic Control can be heard granting the pilots’ request to return to JFK Airport and, because the plane was too heavy, to dump 20 tons of fuel east of Nantucket. The pilot also asks for a veterinarian to meet the plane upon landing, because “we have a horse in difficulty.” At that point, Cuticelli said, “we dispersed veterinary care, animal handlers, medical equipment, horse slings, a horse ambulance, everything necessary to accommodate that horse.” “We had to take the other horses out to get the equipment in to get the horse out,” he said. But once the animal was on the ground, it was determined that its injuries were too severe to survive and it was euthanized, Cuticelli said. CNN was not able to confirm the nature of the horse’s injuries. A representative for the shipping company that transported the horse declined to comment. Performance and breeding horses — including racehorses and show horses — are routinely shuttled safely around the globe without incident. But the episode speaks to the inherent unpredictability of work with horses, which are flight animals that can injure themselves unexpectedly when they are frightened or startled. It would have been virtually impossible for flight grooms — the people responsible for caring for the horse on board — to get the animal safely back into his stall while in mid-air because of the mechanics of how horses are transported on planes. Horses are loaded on the ground into massive, dead-bolted shipping containers with three narrow stalls per container. Those containers are then stacked against one another inside the plane, making impossible to open the stall door mid-flight. Horses can hang their heads over the front barrier of the stall so that flight grooms can replenish feed and water and have access to the animal’s head, but that gangway is narrow. It would also have been impossible for flight grooms to physically lift the horse back into his stall; horses weigh on average around 1,000 pounds. The flight history on tracking site FlightRadar24.com shows that, following the diversion, the plane was able to take off again some three hours behind schedule. It landed in Liege at 6:49 a.m. local time on November 10. Pound for pound, this incident is one of the biggest-hitters when it comes to animals escaping on planes, but critter problems are surprisingly common in the air. In October 2023 alone, an otter and a rat were reported to have caused uproar after escaping from hand luggage on a VietJet flight from Bangkok, while a bear cub broke loose from its crate on a flight from Baghdad to Dubai while passengers were on board. You can watch that video here. And a South African pilot was forced to make an emergency landing in April after a deadly Cape cobra slithered up his shirt.",Travel
New Zealand crowns ‘bird of the century’ championed by John Oliver," The votes are in for New Zealand’s Bird of the Century poll and the winner by a significant margin, getting more than 290,000 votes, is the Australasian crested grebe, better known as the pūteketeke or the ‘puking’ bird championed by comedian and talk show host John Oliver. “It began as an outside contender but was catapulted to the top spot thanks to its unique looks, adorable parenting style and propensity for puking,” wrote conservation charity Forest and Bird in a statement on Wednesday local time announcing the results. New Zealand’s national bird, the kiwi, came in second with 12,904 votes while the kea, a species of large parrot often described as one of the most intelligent birds in the world, landed in third with 12,060 votes. “We’re not surprised these charming characteristics caught the eye of an influential bird enthusiast with a massive following,” the group said, referring to HBO host Oliver’s “high powered campaign,” which caused online voting systems to crash. Originally launched in 2005, the annual competition aims to raise awareness about New Zealand’s native birds, many species of which are threatened, on the brink of extinction or already extinct due to habitat loss and human activity. But it has also stirred controversy in recent years with allegations of “voter fraud” in 2020 and by crowning a bat the winner the following year. “Pūteketeke deserve to be Bird of the Century in 2023 because their numbers have been slowly increasing… It’s great to have a successful bird as an ambassador for all New Zealand birds to show that even threatened species can bounce back if we give them a hand,” the group added. They are water birds native to New Zealand and have been known to make strange noises like barking, growling and clicking. They are characterized by their distinctive plummage, alternating black and white feathers with colored head plummes. Young pūteketeke are also capable of swimming and diving even after newly hatching. The bird were almost hunted to extinction in the United Kingdom during the 19th century and are still under threat today, conservationists say. “There are thought to be fewer than 1,000 birds and the species is also not faring well in Australia,” said Forest and Bird, noting that their numbers across Australia and New Zealand were estimated to be less than 3,000. To help spread the message and raise awareness, Oliver bought up billboards in New Zealand, Japan and the state of Wisconsin. “The Lord of the Wings,” read one, playing on New Zealand’s notoriety as being the filming location for the Lord of the Rings movies. “No bird on earth is more deserving of Bird of the Century than this one,” Oliver said on his show. He also appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon dressed in a pūteketeke costume. “They are weird puking birds with colourful mullets. What’s not to love here?”",Travel
Airline to honor $1.30 flight tickets sold during glitch," Chinese carrier China Southern Airlines said on Thursday it would honor the sale of tickets priced as cheaply as $1.30 during a two-hour technical glitch on its mobile phone app and some ticket-booking platforms late on Wednesday. Consumers began reporting on Chinese social media at around 8 p.m. on Wednesday that many flights to and from the southwest metropolis of Chengdu were available at 10, 20 or 30 yuan ($1.37-$4.12) on China Southern’s app. One screenshot circulating online showed a ticket from Chengdu to Beijing priced at only 10 yuan ($1.37), compared to the normal minimum price of 400 to 500 yuan (about $55 to $69). Other online screenshots indicated the cheap prices were offered for about two hours on the carrier’s app as well as across several ticket-booking platforms, including market leader Trip.com. On top of that price, buyers were required to pay at least an additional 110 yuan ($15) in airport fees and fuel surcharges. “Passengers can use them as normal,” Guangzhou-based China Southern said, on the proviso that tickets were already paid for and issued.

Pizza Hut selling snake pizza in Hong Kong," American company Pizza Hut has teamed up with a century-old Hong Kong restaurant to put a modern spin on a traditional dish, or more simply, snake on a pizza. The new offering combines shredded snake meat, black mushrooms and Chinese dried ham – all indispensable ingredients of an authentic snake stew and part of the Hong Kong franchise’s marketing plot to generate buzz online. Some diners in Hong Kong and around southern China have long enjoyed snake stew, especially during the colder months. According to a saying in the local Cantonese dialect, the best time to eat snake is “when the autumn wind begins to blow” – when they’ve fattened up to prepare for hibernation. Many believe that snake meat has medicinal properties, improving skin conditions and warming up the body. A rich culinary culture based on snakes is common across other parts of Southeast Asia too, such as Vietnam and Thailand, where snakes are usually farmed for consumption. “Paired with cheese and diced chicken, the snake meat becomes richer in taste,” Pizza Hut Hong Kong said in a statement before the dish went on sale last week, adding that the “nourishing” meat “can boost blood circulation” – a common belief in traditional Chinese medicine. “Combined with pizza, it marks a breakthrough from the conventional concept of what maintaining good health means while challenging one’s taste buds,” it added. The chain has partnered with Ser Wong Fun – a snake restaurant in Central Hong Kong with roots dating back to 1895 – to come up with the latest recipe. The 9-inch pizza, which comes with abalone sauce instead of the conventional tomato base, is on sale until November 22. CNN has sampled the pizza and found the texture of the snake similar to dry chicken. Hong Kong resident Mabel Sieh, a self-described foodie who loves to try different pizzas, said, “I think it’s scary. Snakes aren’t food in many cultures, especially in the West.” But Hong Kong native Rachel Wong, a big fan of snake soup since she had her first bowl when she was a kid, is excited about the new item on the menu. “The texture is a bit like chicken and tastes like fish and other kinds of seafood. So I love having it as a high protein meal during winter,” she said. Karen Chan, general manager of Pizza Hut Hong Kong and Macao, said the company tapped Ser Wong Fun’s expertise to prepare a mixed snake recipe from the breeds of Chinese rat snakes, banded kraits, and white banded snakes. “The extraordinary snake pizzas offer a perfect balance to all flavors, both tantalizing and savory for this season,” she said. And Hong Kong’s Pizza Hut locations have other plans for new menu items. The company is also introducing a pizza made with Chinese preserved sausages featured in a claypot rice dish that’s popular among local Hong Kong people when the weather cools down. It is not the first time Asian franchises of the original American brand have adopted a more adventurous gastronomical approach to celebrate local food culture. In the past, Pizza Hut in Taiwan introduced pizzas made with durian, pig blood curds, and preserved eggs – ingredients that play a big role in the local culinary culture. Meanwhile, Pizza Hut in Japan created a pizza topped with Tonkotsu ramen (pork bone soup ramen). And the craze does not stop at Pizza Hut. Dominos put boba, the sweet tapioca balls found in bubble tea, on its pizza three years ago in Taiwan as a tribute to the local dessert drink that has gained popularity around the world.",Travel
Michelin-starred restaurant closes because it’s too expensive," After 26 years in business, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is closing due to costs becoming too expensive – for both customers and the restaurant operators. Deanes EIPIC, the flagship fine dining restaurant of an empire started by Northern Irish chef Michael Deane in the 1990s, won its first Michelin star within a year of opening as Deanes in 1997. However, this month the company announced Deanes EIPIC will be closing by the end of 2023 due to increased price sensitivity among customers and the impact of Covid, Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis. A relaunch is planned with a new “value for money” focus. Head chef Alex Greene, a finalist on the UK TV show “Great British Menu,” tells CNN Travel he sees the move as symptomatic of a growing trend in the hospitality industry. “EIPIC as a whole wasn’t a restaurant that was dying,” he says, but “people have an expectation when walking through the doors. The cost of delivering that expectation has doubled since lockdown, the cost has spiralled out of control. And we can’t double the price.” Tasting menus at EIPIC are £100 a pop (around $123), so hardly at the extreme end of the price scale but, as a small city, Belfast doesn’t have the flow-through of wealthy diners found in the likes of London or Paris. EIPIC follows the classic fine-dining model upon which many a Michelin star has been earned throughout Europe and beyond. However, Greene says, “the more luxurious end of dining, white linen tablecloths and service and stuff, it seems to be becoming a bygone era.” Modern restaurants of Michelin caliber are “more stripped back,” he adds. While the passion, dedication and quality of food are still there, “You don’t have the white linen tablecloth, you don’t have the same level of service” and it’s more “economic to deliver to the customer.” While there’s a still a market for traditional fine dining, it’s shrinking. And the strains being felt by the UK industry are also in terms of labor shortages. “It’s about finding the right staff, with the right kind of level of dedication, knowledge, everything,” says Greene. “It’s very hard to find and very expensive to get.” Greene and Deanes EIPIC general manager Bronagh McCormick are moving out of the city to start a new food and venture in 2024 in the Mourne countryside south of Belfast. While quality food and drink was once hard to find in rural Northern Ireland, there’s been a post-Covid boom here, as in other parts of the UK countryside. “Take Belfast as an example,” says Greene. “This year there have been more rate rises, there’s an increase in property insurance, an increase of everything within the city.” The Mourne region, famous for its mountains and sea, was recently named a UNESCO Global Geopark and next year the seaside resort of Newcastle will host the Irish Open golfing tournament. Says Greene, “people are willing to travel from the city or anywhere for good food and good accommodation. And the costs of doing it in the countryside are significantly lower than in the city.” Deanes EIPIC is the latest in a series of closures of high-profile restaurants. In January, one of the world’s most famous restaurants, Copenhagen’s Noma, announced it was closing, with owner René Redzepi telling the New York Times the fine dining business model was “unsustainable.” And in August, English-French celebrity chef Michel Roux Jr. announced that he will be closing his two-Michelin-starred London restaurant Le Gavroche next January to “make time for a better work/life balance.”",Travel
A cake in the shape of a diving platform wins the Pastry Grand Prix in Paris," Displayed in a room overlooking the Seine that was filled with the smell of warm butter and baked flour, an opéra pastry in the form of a diving platform perched in a shiny, blue pool was awarded the best pastry of Paris title on Tuesday. A panel of seven judges – including pastry chefs, industry representatives and everyday Parisians and led by legendary French pastry chef Pierre Hermé – presided over the competition. Fittingly named “The Diving Opéra,” the winner of this year’s Pastry Grand Prix was created by Michelin-starred pastry chef Raamin Samiyi. Tourists and Parisians have flocked to the gourmet doughnut store Momzi, which Samiyi opened in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris. “Thank you so much! My heart is beating so fast right now,” Samiyi said with a shaking voice as Hermé called him on spearkerphone to inform him of the result. Hermé, who has his own renowned pastry shop and heads up making desserts for French state banquets (including the one held for King Charles’ recent visit to France), expressed his amazement at the fact that Samiyi is himself a swimmer and diver. “My coach is actually going to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics,” Samiyi responded. The theme of this year’s Grand Prix was “sporting values” as the French capital gears up to host the Olympic and Paralympic games next summer. All pastry shops, bakeries, hotels and restaurants in Paris are eligible to participate in the competition. But each shop, chain or group can send only one candidate. Among the other requirements, participants must use at least one ingredient either cultivated or produced in the French capital. The pastry submitted must also be conceptualized specifically for the Grand Prix and able to be produced and sold commercially in the participant’s shop. The 12 pastries that entered the final round represented many of the world’s favorite French pastries, including opéra, Saint-Honoré, éclair and lemon tarte. The competing cakes were graded on five factors – taste, technique, creativity, ingredient quality and aesthetic – with each worth five points. The four-hour long tasting and grading session unfolded in a light-hearted atmosphere. When the first cake was served  – a lemon tarte with cheesecake filling called l’Olympia – two judges struggled for a while before writing down their notes. “The first one is always difficult,” they laughed. One pastry – in the form of a whistle, with coffee and chocolate filling – sparked the interest of Paris Deputy Mayor Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, who was co-chair of the judging panel. “Is it difficult to balance the taste of coffee and chocolate when put side-by-side in a cake?” Bonnet-Oulaldj asked the professionals at the table. “It’s difficult, but it is really the basic of the basics for a pastry chef,” Hermé replied as others laughed. For his win, Samiyi will receive 4,000 euros ($4,365) and win a seat on the judging panel of next year’s Grand Prix. Whether Samiyi will put his winning diving platform opéra on sale in his store is up to him, the Paris mayor’s office told CNN. For those with a sweet tooth visiting Paris this Christmas and next year, keep an eye out for a sweet diving pool — you don’t want to miss the best pastry in Paris.",Travel
The ‘world’s skinniest hotel’ measures nine feet across," A new hotel in Indonesia is trying to nab the title of being the “world’s skinniest.” But its creator says the project isn’t just about trying to set a world record – it’s about getting international attention for the small town he calls home. Ary Indra grew up in Salatiga, Central Java. After training as an architect and making his career in Jakarta and Singapore, he felt himself called to return home to Salatiga – and to use his skills there. There, he found an unwanted piece of land, which no one was willing to develop on due to its odd size. It’s now the home of PituRooms, a seven-room hotel (Pitu is Javanese for “seven”) that measures just 2.8 meters (9 feet) wide. The building is five floors high, with each of the seven rooms big enough for a double bed and small bathroom with a shower and toilet. Each room has a different feel thanks to local artwork and interiors. “I want people to experience Salatiga in a new way,” Indra tells CNN. “I own, designed and operate PituRooms with my own team. It has become my new platform to generate a new type of tourism which involves local communities.” Salatiga is 300 miles southeast of Jakarta, and mostly unknown by foreigners who head to Yogyakarta, Surabaya or the nearby island of Bali for their holidays instead. Case in point: Indra tells CNN that PituRooms, which opened in December 2022, has had “only five percent” non-Indonesian guests. But within Indonesia, Indra says, Salatiga is known a tolerant city that has good food, good infrastructure and a good quality of life. It was a popular weekend getaway for the Dutch during the colonial era. Indra says that most Indonesians think of Salatiga as a nice place to retire, but his hope is that PituRooms is the first of many projects that will help outsiders see that Salatiga is about much more than just living slowly. “Aside from the technical difficulties, the biggest challenge was the typical mindset surrounding the hospitality industry that is used to superlative words: biggest, tallest, most luxurious. Here we are skinniest,” Indra told Dezeen, an architecture blog. We tried very hard to turn this limitation to become our strongest selling point, that this is a built study of micro-space, and guests can experience the possibility of living and choreographing their movement in ‘just enough’ space.” The city is at the foot of Mount Merbabu, which PituRooms guests can see from their hotel rooms. In addition to the hotel rooms, there is a rooftop restaurant that locals can enjoy, and PituRooms plans to host events and art exhibitions.",Travel
Inside Dolly Parton’s new resort lodge in the Tennessee mountains," When a petite blonde with a high hairdo and even higher heels is expected to be in a certain corner of Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains, the devoted start making travel plans. Crowds of people gather, with their necks craned and cell phones held high, seeking recorded proof of this life force with a wide smile and an infectious laugh. A master singer-songwriter, a savvy businesswoman and all-around beloved entertainer who’s not afraid to make a boob joke at her own press conference. That’s the atmosphere Dolly Parton’s presence brings to the Smokies, where she’s just opened her second resort hotel connected to the Dollywood amusement park complex in eastern Tennessee. Her longstanding business partnership with Herschend Family Entertainment, stoked by Parton’s star power, also has an estimated annual direct economic impact of $1.8 billion, and there are plans on the horizon for more Dollywood resorts and attractions to fuel the state’s growing tourism industry. The 302-room HeartSong Lodge & Resort had its grand opening Friday and Parton came out to launch the property, Dolly-style, with some snappy jokes and a few minutes of singing and strumming – verses from 1994’s “Heartsong” – to pay tribute to her rural Tennessee roots that the rustic lodge draws on. Parton’s sparkling, spangled persona doesn’t dominate the resort’s aesthetic, which she called “high-fashion rustic.” But the 77-year-old star herself delivered plenty of glam at the opening, taking the stage in a bold print dress with black ruffles at the hem, black beading draped at the waist and a signature plunging neckline that elicited this quip: “I’m the only person that ever left the Smoky Mountains and took ‘em with her.” But it’s Parton’s warmth and hospitality, not flashy style, that are on display at HeartSong. “I’m just a down-home person and all the people I grew up with are just likable, easygoing people. And I guess once you’ve kind of had that instilled in your whole psyche, in your whole being, that does follow you,” Parton told CNN Travel in an interview after the launch event. Employees across the Dollywood empire greet guests with a smile and are quick to ask how they can help. “When you grow up in a big family, you cater to one another, you cater to your neighbors, you cater to your friends, even on Sundays when the preacher comes over, you’re always kind of giving and we kinda have that spirit (at Dollywood resorts),” said Parton, who grew up rich in music but without material wealth as the fourth of 12 children. It’s Dolly Parton’s childhood in the foothills of east Tennessee that takes center stage here. In the lobby, a four-story stone fireplace has an iron grate with a depiction of a young Dolly among trees and butterflies, while the opposite side features a monumental portrait of the artist. Behind the reception desk, a massive screen rotates through imagery nodding to the current season: in fall, a mama bear and her clumsy cubs, a majestic, blinking owl, and the red, brown and ocher-hued treetops blanketing the mountain crests. The natural world and seasonal changes are captured throughout the hotel. The hallways on the guestroom floors feature artwork tied to the four seasons, while the fireflies that captivated young Dolly appear in the carpeting alongside the concentric rings found in tree trunks, an apt nod to the accumulated experiences of a lifetime. Nearly half of the rooms have balconies so guests can enjoy the mountain air. In the guestrooms, wall-length murals feature either day or nighttime scenes with bears, raccoons and butterflies. There are more than a dozen room and suite types – including a variety of configurations with separate bunk rooms for kids, complete with beds made up with a sleeping bag-sheet hybrid where the covers unzip. HeartSong has Camp DW kids’ crafts and morning reading time drawing upon Parton’s Imagination Library effort promoting reading among young children. There’s an outdoor pool with a waterfall and splash pad as well as a hot tub and an indoor pool. Both pools are lifeguarded. A large firepit hosts evening singalongs, and smaller seating areas with firepits are scattered around the large patio. A wood-burning firepit is home to the resort’s evening “Roasties,” a twist on s’mores. While the lodge is rustic, there’s some subtle shimmer in the lobby and plush, smoky blue velvet sofas. The singer’s sparkly aesthetic is on display in HeartSong’s separate Acoustic Lobby, a pink-and-purple space that’s offered for private dining. Here, there’s a chandelier of acoustic guitars and displays of Parton’s dazzling outfits. When it’s not in use as a private space, guests are invited to enjoy the room. There’s a grab-and-go market, and the primary restaurant, Ember & Elm, serves a la carte breakfast and dinner featuring Southern classics (the biscuits served with local jams are addictive). The adjacent High Note is a more casual restaurant/bar with all-day dining. HeartSong follows Dollywood’s first hotel, DreamMore Resort and Spa, which opened nearby in 2015. That property has a more feminine feel, complete with a spa and salon. Peak season rates at the new HeartSong Lodge start at $319. Peak-season DreamMore rates start at $269. Rates are typically lower in January and February when the theme park is closed. Parton’s music, kindness and down-home charm inspire legions of fans, many of whom become loyal customers. Some made pilgrimages to Pigeon Forge for the resort’s opening – and, they hoped, to catch a glimpse of their idol. Allen Jones drove seven hours from Dothan, Alabama – something he’s done dozens of times as a Dollywood season-passholder. He used to come with family members who have since died, but over the years he’s befriended other avid Parton fans from around the country, and they often meet up here. “They’re my family now,” said Jones, 54, sitting in the hotel lobby wearing a T-shirt that read, “Everyone has their addiction. Mine just happens to be Dolly Parton.” Jones saw Parton twice on Friday – during her press event in the morning and as she left HeartSong for the day. Carol Malerbi made a pilgrimage to Dollywood from New Hampshire in the hopes of seeing Parton, whose music was played for her while she was in a two-month coma about a decade ago due to complications from diabetes. “I just love her, I love her inspiration,” she said, alongside her husband Jim, who made a cutting board for Parton bearing an eagle and a butterfly. The couple gave it to HeartSong staff in the hopes that it would make it to Parton. It was their first trip to Dollywood, and they timed it with the hopes of seeing the star, which they did for “two seconds” as Parton made her way out of the hotel Friday evening. Autumn Martin, wearing a pink Dolly sweatshirt, was enjoying her first visit to HeartSong with her husband, their 8-year-old son and her husband’s parents. The elementary school teacher from Marietta, Georgia, is such a Parton fan that she’s incorporated the singer’s music and message into her teaching. “My whole classroom is Dolly-themed,” she said. Each year Martin and her kindergarten class stage a year-end production of Dolly Parton songs, with some tweaked lyrics (“9 to 5” becomes “8 to 3” to better align with her school’s hours). “We love the sparkles and the glitter. But it’s really about being kind,” she said when asked about Parton’s influence. “She teaches us to care for everybody. She embodies a genuine goodness. It’s something I want the kids to emulate.” For some fans, visiting Dollywood – and the prospect of spotting Dolly herself on an occasion like HeartSong’s opening – is a near-religious experience. One excited young boy claimed to have caught a glimpse of the superstar herself Friday as he peered into a room off the resort lobby. The woman beside him said, “I wish you cared this much about God.” Parton’s enduring appeal translated to more than three million Dollywood visitors last year, making it the state’s largest ticketed attraction. Sevier County – home to Sevierville, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg – generated nearly $3.8 billion in visitor spending in 2022, putting it third behind Davidson County, where Nashville is located, and Shelby County, home to Memphis, according to the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development (TDTD). That figure is up 53% from pre-pandemic, 2018 figures. “Out of the top 40 tourism states in America, we’re the fastest growing state in the last five years in terms of visitor spending,” Mark Ezell, TDTD’s commissioner, told CNN Travel. Dolly Parton’s impact on the state is “profound, and it keeps on growing,” said Ezell, who called Parton “our second first lady of Tennessee.” And HeartSong Lodge is just 10 miles north of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most-visited national park in the US. HeartSong also has 26,000 square feet of event space. With Dollywood closed for two months during the winter, the lodge included that space to increase business, particularly during that period, said Kevin Osborn, HeartSong’s general manager. All this, of course, started with a theme park. Three other parks called the site home before Dolly Parton’s involvement turned it into Dollywood. The original park, Rebel Railroad, dates back to 1961. It was followed by Gold Rush Junction and Silver Dollar City, whose owners, Jack and Pete Herschend, joined forces with Parton in the 1980s. On May 3, 1986, Dollywood opened, more than doubling attendance over the previous season. For the uninitiated, in addition to roller coasters, rides and live entertainment, Dollywood features a replica of Parton’s childhood Tennessee mountain home, a two-room cabin that gives visitors a sense of her modest roots. The park also holds a bald eagle sanctuary, where more than a dozen non-releasable birds live in a wooded enclosure. Many additions and updates have followed, leading up to the $25 million Big Bear Mountain roller coaster that opened in May. And for die-hard Dolly fans, there’s more to come. The Dolly Parton Experience, a complete revamp of the former Chasing Rainbows Museum and several other nearby buildings, is expected to open in May 2024. It will offer interactive highlights of Parton’s life and covers her TV shows, movies, her many duets and her beloved Imagination Library, which gives free books to children. Another building will contain “Behind the Seams,” showcasing her performance outfits, wigs and more. Visitors also will be able to board one of her former tour buses, removed from the park right now during the renovations, to see how their idol crisscrossed the country. Over time, the company plans to add three more resorts, including an upscale RV experience outlooked for 2026, according to Eugene Naughton, president of The Dollywood Company. And DreamMore is planning a décor refresh for 2024. “You know every few years I get a little facelift, a little nip and tuck myself,” Parton said at the press event, adding that “it’s only right” that her hotels should do the same. All of these attractions, just a few miles from where Parton grew up, just add to the destination’s expanding tourism offerings. “I’m so proud of every business, every hotel, every motel – all the people around here,” she said, “because this is my home.” CNN’s Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.",Travel
Secrets of the ‘world’s best hotel’," The “best hotel in the world” was built by a pope and was regularly visited by one of Italy’s most famous opera composers. Napoleon Bonaparte and Winston Churchill have stayed and walked through the grounds. Passalacqua, you could say, was always destined for big things. On 19 September in London at the inaugural World’s 50 Best Hotels, the hotel on Lake Como was named number one. The judges – a team of industry experts – chose to go with this 24-suite family-owned property instead of one run by a major brand. There are thousands of luxury hotels across the globe but only one Passalacqua. It feels almost even redundant referring to it as a hotel, because it’s so much more. It pays homage to another time and place, and – through an extraordinary, indulgent voyage – takes you there. Silvio Vettorello, general manager, attributes the win to three unique attributes. “Meraviglia [amazement]: that sense of awe you feel in a place that is everything you imagined and yet still manages to amaze and astonish you. Storia [history]: the history of an 18th century mansion that – even with echoes of a past era – makes you so easily feel at home. And famiglia [family] – in every sense, but particularly one that comprises the 100 incredible humans that every day go above and beyond to make magic for our guests, making sure every dream comes true – theirs and ours.” Passalacqua threw open its doors in 2022 after a three-year restoration. The owners, the local De Santis family, are no strangers to luxury hospitality – they own the Grand Hotel Tremezzo also on Como, known for its lake-floating pool. Owners Antonella Mallone and Paolo De Santis handed over to their 41 year old daughter, Valentina De Santis, to open the property. The CEO of their company, Valentina, who was responsible for bringing it back to its former glory. She says every single detail is close to her heart. Like the precious marbles hailing from Carrara and Verona, spectacular chandeliers from Murano’s Barovier & Toso (not least the breathtaking one hanging in the music room), Venetian mirrors and the plush Beltrami wood fiber bed linens. There are seven acres of lake-facing terraced gardens, meticulously manicured and complete with a calming soundtrack of water fountains. Guests spend their time out here having a drink, partaking in yoga or lounging by the pool decked out in vibrant vintage prints from Milanese brand La Double J. De Santis says, “Passalacqua has a storied and rich history and is a one of a kind experience that evokes another time.” It holds many a secret, too. “As you pass through the front gates, you enter a different world – one you may not want to leave,” she says. “It is tranquil and private, yet steps away from the bustling village of Moltrasio. Opening doors and exploring passages you are led to magnificent rooms and centuries-old views of Lake Como. You have lushly painted ceilings with clouds full of gods and goddesses looking down at you. But one of the most delightful surprises are the underground stone-lined tunnels that lead from the villa down to the lake. The tunnels are full of mystery and intrigue.” Standing in the majestic gardens and looking out to the lake, it’s not hard to imagine the Moltrasio of yesterday – Especially once the sun sets and the glittering garden lights turn on. It was in 1787 that Count Passalacqua – from a local noble family – acquired the villa. With regular scenes of carriages coming and going and concerts playing into the night, it fast became a grand playground for the aristocracy. Just like the count, the De Santis family saw something beyond special, almost magical in these grounds. In 1837, Vincenzo Bellini – a regular visitor to the villa – composed his opera “La Sonnambula” (The Sleepwalker), a tormented story of unrequited desires and sleepwalking while in residence. You can’t help but wonder what went on behind these old walls. They make you feel the weight of history, and on a breezy day, it’s almost as though you can hear echoes of Bellini’s melodies. That’s the spell of Passalacqua – through the present, it provokes thought and connects you to another place, another time. From check in to check out, the hotel strives to put on a feast for the senses. Local experiences can be arranged by the concierge, hand cut bouquets of flowers just seem to appear, meditation and massages are always an option and there’s a culinary program headed by chef Alessandro Rinaldi that celebrates Italian classics. The kitchen is open for guests to linger in and out throughout the day to grab a snack or to get involved in baking or cooking. And there’s so much more. De Santis can speak of the splendors of the villa at length. While quick to assure that every hour of the day here is special, she admits that for her nothing beats early morning. “It’s when breakfast is served in the style of a big Italian country house in the summer. That great smell of coffee as you walk into the kitchen, mingling with the heady scent of a marmalade crostata [like a giant jam tart] fresh out of the oven. “A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, a meter-high cake stand piled high with granita and cream-filled maritozzo buns. Plus, chef is on hand to prepare whatever you fancy – like sunny-side-up eggs which were laid by our hens that morning. It’s the perfect start to a perfect day.” And what would a hotel be without its guests? Vettorello says that the thing they love most about their stay is the sense of villeggiatura. The Italian word translates as a vacation in a rural location. But it means so much more than that. It’s the essence of dreamy escapism and the age-old practice of getting away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life for a more tranquil setting. Picture “Bridgerton” or a Jane Austen novel, but in Italy. Instead of the Scottish Highlands or the Yorkshire Moors, you have Lake Como and its elegant gardens. Instead of a horse-drawn carriage, you have horsepower of a different kind, in the form of vintage orange Italian Jeeps. Tea is swapped for a Campari soda or a negroni sbagliato. And instead of scones and jam, you have the abundance of the Italian aperitivo. It’s a feeling that is intrinsically and quintessentially Italian – the guilt-free pleasure of taking time out, escaping the city and finding peace with nature. Think, la dolce vita, but better! And the team at Passalacqua have done an outstanding job at reviving this ancient and affluent art. Passalacqua didn’t invent the term villeggiatura, but her every detail embodies it – a romantic 18th century villa turned faultless luxury hotel where you come to exhale and leave your worries behind. Of course, all this luxury comes at a price. Rooms without a lake view start at 1,300 euros ($1,381) per night or 1,700 euros ($1,806) for a view in November – lowest season. Next summer, rates rise to 2,300 euros ($2,443) for a standard room without a lake view, or 3,200 ($3,400) for the cheapest room with a view. Suites start at around $5,000 per night. Luckily, prices include breakfast. Asked what the property has in particular that no other place in the world does and Valentina says, “It’s a place of wonders created from the heart.” Maria Pasquale is an award-winning Italian-Australian food and travel journalist based in Rome.

Fontainebleau readying $3.7-billion Las Vegas hotel," One of the most storied hotel companies in the United States is inching closer to a brand new, $3.7-billion resort in Las Vegas — a resort 23 years in the making. Fontainebleau Las Vegas will be the sister property of Fontainebleau Miami Beach, a sprawling and now iconic landmark that opened in 1954 and is widely regarded as America’s first destination resort. The Las Vegas outpost is set to open December 13 on 25 acres at the north end of the Las Vegas Strip, essentially between the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Sahara. Its shimmering monolithic façade will be visible from the northernmost turns on the course of the Formula One car race that will rumble around Sin City next month. In a city that prides itself on show-stoppers, the debut of this particular hotel is a big deal — Fontainebleau brings major name recognition and is the first new resort on the Strip since Resorts World opened in 2021. The 3,644-room resort also represents the culmination of a 23-year journey that started for Jeffrey Soffer, Fontainebleau Development’s chairman and CEO, when he purchased the land back in 2000. Construction on the hotel began in 2007, but construction stopped the following year due to the Great Recession. The building sat there, 70% finished, for 12 years — a giant steel punchline to jokes about overdevelopment. Finally, a flurry of deals rekindled the project just before the pandemic. Soffer and Fontainebleau Development, in partnership with Koch Real Estate Investments, reacquired the property in 2021 and charged forward with plans to finish what they had started. While every resort in Las Vegas offers high-end suites for the biggest gamblers, the high-end suites at Fontainebleau Las Vegas promise to unlock a new level of elegance, according to an exclusive recently obtained by CNN Travel. These 76 suites — collectively branded as Fontainebleau Fleur de Lis — will occupy the top five floors of the 67-story tower. Considering Fontainebleau Las Vegas is the tallest occupiable building in the state (the Strat Tower is taller but it’s technically not an occupiable building), the suites will offer commanding views of the Strip and the entire Las Vegas Valley. Other notable features in some of the suites include billiards tables, wellness rooms and custom Italian bedding. Fontainebleau Development president Brett Mufson said the Fleur de Lis collection offers a “six-star experience” tailored to individual preferences, creating a home-away-from-home feel for every guest. “We are proud to say Fleur de Lis is a masterpiece, with meaning behind every detail and design choice, and we cannot wait for guests to discover what we’ve created for them,” he told CNN last week. Fleur de Lis suites range in size from 1,000 square feet to the pinnacle of luxury: the 10,000-square-foot penthouse. Designed by the London-based David Collins Studio, these spaces feature high ceilings, as well as several design nods to the original mid-century modern Fontainebleau Miami Beach. For example, all suites — and a host of other spaces around the resort — boast the bowtie shape that original architect Morris Lapidus designed for the Florida property. “As we approached this project, we recognized that the design needed to be a nod to the original location, with aspects incorporated throughout the property, but we needed to create something entirely new and unexpected to meet the moment,” said Simon Rawlings, chief creative officer at the David Collins Studio. “The history is in the details with icons and symbols effortlessly incorporated into the design that represent the history and authentic personality [of the brand].” Mufson added that Fleur de Lis guests have access to personal valet and concierge service for arranging tickets and dinner reservations, as well as butlers who can help find the perfect pillows, draw baths and more. Published rates for Fleur de Lis suites start at $5,000 per night, while regular rooms start at $300 per night. Fontainebleau Las Vegas also is taking an unconventional approach to its 36 restaurants and bars. The resort has partnered with Groot Hospitality to bring Fontainebleau Miami Beach’s nightclub LIV and homegrown restaurants Komodo and Papi Steak to the desert (in perfect-for-Vegas larger formats). Other concepts in the resort’s collection feature all-stars including Michelin-starred chefs Masa Ito and Kevin Kim, Chef Evan Funke and restaurateurs Alan Yau and David Rodolitz, to name a few. Perhaps most notably, Cantina Contramar, a restaurant opening in 2024, will unite for the first time in the United States three of the most recognized and celebrated women in the Mexican culinary and creative communities: chef Gabriela Cámara, architect Frida Escobedo, and Tequila Casa Dragones founder and the first maestra tequilera, Bertha González Nieves. In a Las Vegas first, the cantina will have a Casa Dragones tasting room. This out-of-the-box food and beverage plan certainly is turning heads. Al Mancini, creator of Neon Feast, a restaurant guide and app, said the Fontainebleau model could be a “game-changer” for the local food scene. “We haven’t tasted any food yet, but it’s especially interesting when a brand-new operator wants to partner with people who aren’t entrenched [in the Vegas dining scene],” said Mancini, who worked as a local food writer for 20 years before launching Neon Feast in 2022. “At the very minimum, [Fontainebleau] will bring high-end dining to the north end of the Strip, which will benefit everyone.” There will be other standout elements of Fontainebleau Las Vegas as well. One example: the 55,000-square-foot Lapis Spa designed by Milan-based Lissoni & Partners. Inspired by the Lapis Spa at Fontainebleau Miami Beach, the Las Vegas iteration will comprise 44 treatment rooms, a purifying salt cave, a healing infrared sauna, men’s and women’s hydrotherapy lounges and a co-ed sensory room with communal healing waters. Spa lighting also is programmed to mimic the lighting outside; it waxes and wanes depending on the time of day. Fontainebleau Las Vegas also has grabbed headlines for some of its entertainment bookings; earlier this month the resort announced Post Malone would open the 3,800-seat BleauLive Theater with shows on December 30 and 31. Mufson said Fontainebleau likely will ink other artists to smaller, limited-engagement runs of anywhere from two to eight shows at a time — a notable departure from the trend of Las Vegas resorts signing performers to long-term residencies, and a throwback to the days when the Rat Pack or Elvis would come to Fontainebleau Miami Beach for one or two shows at a time. This might be the greatest asset of Fontainebleau Las Vegas: It’s a new hotel with lots of history. In a town that celebrates fire and flash, the pairing of sophistication and substance should be quite a win. Matt Villano is a writer and editor in Northern California.

She went on a solo trip to Italy. Right away she met the love of her life," Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. “I’ll go for one song and suss it out,” she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie’s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. “I walked in and he was there,” Kacie tells CNN Travel today. “We clocked eyes.” “Ciao,” said the stranger, smiling. “Ciao,” Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: “That’s all the Italian I’ve got for you.” It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting – and terrifying – experience. “I was a professional dancer in New York,” explains Kacie. “A very exhausting career – there’s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there’s a lot of politics that come into play – and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little – just stagnant, if you will.” Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she’d long felt a “pull” to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. “I kept saying, ‘I’ll wait for somebody to go with, I’ll wait, I’ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night – at two in the morning – I was like, ‘What am I waiting for? Life is too short.’ So I booked a solo trip to Italy.” Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city’s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that’s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. “I’m really glad that I listened to her,” says Kacie. “That’s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn’t originally supposed to be there.” The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario’s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. “That place is, let’s say, unconventional for Florence,” Dario tells CNN Travel. “Usually in Florence, there’s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.” When Dario realized Kacie didn’t know much Italian beyond “ciao,” they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he’d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he’d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. “We bonded from the beginning,” says Dario. “It was really natural, really easy conversation.” “I remember he made me laugh,” says Kacie. “And I was like, ‘Oh, this guy’s interesting.” So many people ask us, ‘How did you know?’ And I don’t know how I knew. I was just like, ‘Oh, this is something different.’” Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. “He would meet me after his work – every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,” recalls Kacie. “I instantly fell in love with Florence. It’s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.” It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence’s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film – somewhere between every millennial’s favorite “The Lizzie McGuire Movie” and classic Florentine romance “A Room with a View.” Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie – only it wasn’t obvious this one had a happy ending. “I got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,” she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. “I just met my future husband in Florence,” she wrote. “That’s the guy I’m gonna marry. I’m never gonna see him again.” Her friend tried to cheer her up. “You’re going to Rome,” she wrote. “You’ll meet a gladiator!” But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn’t replaceable. “We never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,” she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. “It was really cool to see it through his eyes,” she says. “She showed me the real city,” says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week’s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. “It was never a decision to be made,” says Kacie. “It just went without saying,” agrees Dario. “But I can’t hide it, long distance was hard.” The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. “Why don’t I move here?” he suggested. He’d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. “Up until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic – we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,” says Kacie. “Saying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.” But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. “It was really exciting,” says Dario. Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City’s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found “many silver linings” in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario’s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn’t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt “relief” that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. “That was a pretty big wake-up call,” she says. “I had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.” On top of this, Kacie’s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. “Everything kind of fell into place,” she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She’d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. “It went viral,” says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario’s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. “I remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,” says Kacie. “Which is crazy, because it’s like the main focus point of Florence. And there’s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.” While that moment was surreal – even sad – Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They’d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario’s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly – even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario’s mother didn’t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. “They bonded immediately,” says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. “I think it was a really good idea diving into it,” he says today. “It was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.” Almost four years later, Kacie’s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. “I really love the life we’ve created here,” says Kacie. “We live in a beautiful place with great food and he’s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.” The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don’t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. “We’re enjoying the moment,” says Dario. “The solid thing is the fact that we know we’re in it together. And that’s what makes it so great,” says Kacie. She tells Dario: “I’m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I’ve got you.” Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. “There were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural – like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,” she says. “You never really know what life has planned for you. There’s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,” adds Kacie. “Trust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it’s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.”",Travel
She bought an airplane ticket she thought was a scam. Then her future husband was on board," The flight seemed too good to be true. When Martina Jones got the text with the details, she scrutinized them for several minutes. It was a $279 round-trip flight departing from either Washington D.C. or New York City, flying to Nairobi, Kenya. “Of course, this was a great deal, I wanted to take advantage of it,” Martina tells CNN Travel today. “But it was also very weird, I thought it might be a scam.” It was November 2014, the day after Martina’s 29th birthday. The flight was scheduled for the following March. After weighing up the options and doing some research, Martina decided to bite the bullet and buy the ticket. Then she sent the deal round her various group chats, encouraging more of her friends to sign up. Martina fell in love with travel during her stint studying abroad in London. After graduating college, she taught English in South Korea and then backpacked around Southeast Asia. “I’m a traveler, through and through,” says Martina. “It gives me life.” In 2014, several years into her New Jersey-based sales job, Martina was feeling a little disillusioned and bored by work. But she kept herself motivated by counting down the days until her next trip. Across the Hudson River in New York City, Leslie Johnson, 33, also received a text from a friend with the Nairobi flight details. Like Martina, Leslie was skeptical – the price seemed too good to be true. And to get the deal, you had to follow a series of random links – it really did seem like a potential con. But the friend who’d forwarded the deal to Leslie was a seasoned flyer. They’d found the details via a travel group for Black travelers. Leslie – who “traveled a bit here and there, but not too crazy, just enough to get one or two passport stamps a year” – trusted their judgment, so decided to go for it. His confirmation email didn’t arrive for a couple days. Leslie spent that waiting period still slightly convinced he’d been scammed. Finally, the details came through. “Then I knew it was good,” Leslie recalls. March rolled around. The first leg of the flight, from the US to Amsterdam, was uneventful. In Amsterdam, Martina attempted to amend her booking so she could sit with her friends – she was traveling with five others and they were all at the back of the plane, while she was sitting on her own at the front. The gate agent advised Martina to ask her fellow passengers if they’d mind moving. But when Martina asked, no one would budge, so she settled down to her textbooks instead – Martina was studying for the GMAT, a business school admissions test, and figured she could use the long flight time to get in some study. By chance, Leslie was also separated from his friend on this leg of the flight. And by coincidence, he was seated directly in front of Martina. He was immediately struck by Martina and intrigued by her. He’d also studied for the GMAT in the past, so once the airplane had taken off from Schiphol Airport, Leslie plucked up the courage to speak to Martina, using the test and the textbook as an entryway. From there, the conversation never let up. “We talked the entire flight,” says Martina. “We had a really good conversation.” Throughout the hours-long chat, Martina remained sat in her seat while Leslie knelt backwards on his, looking back at her. There was a seat next to Martina, but Leslie didn’t want to overstep any boundaries by inviting himself to sit there. As the aircraft made its way south, Leslie and Martina spoke about jobs, travel, their interests and their lives, and realized they lived a seven-minute drive from each other, on opposite sides of the Hudson River. Almost every key topic was covered, but the two danced around the topic of their respective relationship statuses. “In the back of my head, I’m thinking,’If he’s single, we’re going to date.’ But I didn’t know if he was single,” recalls Martina. Before they landed in Nairobi, Martina asked Leslie for his phone number – but in the context of networking. Leslie had been talking about a friend who worked in TV production and Martina was interested in getting into that world. “And then we went our separate ways,” she says. While nothing obviously romantic had happened, Martina disembarked the plane with that same feeling of certainty: “We’re going to be together.” There was something in the way they spoke to each other. Something about the way they looked at each other. But most of all, it was the ease Martina felt in his company. A couple of her friends spotted the connection too. “Oh, he’s cute. I saw you,” said one of them, nudging Martina as they disembarked the plane. Over the next week, Martina and Leslie enjoyed their respective adventures in and around Nairobi. They both thought about one another from time to time, but mostly focused on enjoying their travels. “Then, on the very last day – or his last day, I was staying a day longer – we ended up at the same restaurant,” says Martina. It was a seafood restaurant – Martina’s favorite, but far from Leslie’s first choice. He hates seafood and when his friend suggested it, he’d considered vetoing the idea, but then decided he didn’t want to “be that person.” So he ended up, against the odds, at a restaurant where he couldn’t eat almost anything on the menu. And then he spotted Martina and he forgot all about the food. She saw him too. They didn’t meet each other’s gaze. Instead, they both stole glances when they thought the other wasn’t looking. “I was excited to see him,” says Martina. “But I was also playing it very cool.” Leslie got up several times and walked by Martina’s table, hoping she might spot him and speak to him. “I went to the restroom. Didn’t think she caught my attention. So I end up going back like two or three more times and still didn’t make any kind of eye contact with her,” he says. But, then, coincidentally, Leslie and Martina both ended up leaving the restaurant at the same time. The restaurant was in a hotel, so the two ended up standing in the lobby together, both with their friends in tow, chatting for a bit. It was, says Martina, “a little awkward.” But she still left with that same thought: “If he’s single, we’re going to have a moment.” “It’s weird, because it was just a matter-of-fact feeling,” says Martina today. “It wasn’t necessarily like, ‘Oh, I just met this guy - I’m so excited!’ It was just a very calm, matter-of-fact: ‘We just had a great conversation. He seems like a great person. And if he’s single, that’s it. We’re going to date.’” Leslie was single. Just before he flew to Nairobi, he’d deleted the dating apps he’d been using off and on for the past couple of years. “I live in New York City,” he thought. “There’s no way I can’t meet someone in person.” On past travels, he’d daydreamed about meeting someone at the airplane gate, or boarding the airplane and catching someone’s eye. But he’d never thought it would actually happen. And when it did actually happen, it just felt natural. “Everything just kind of seemed like it was meant to be, or just was happening for a reason,” says Leslie. A few days later, once Martina and Leslie were both home in the US, Martina sent him a text. “How’s jet lag treating you?” she wrote. From there, they messaged back and forth for a day or two, comparing what they’d each got up to in Nairobi. Then Leslie invited Martina to dinner. He picked out a South African restaurant in Midtown. Martina lived right on the edge of New Jersey and could usually get into New York City within 10 minutes. But that day, the traffic was terrible. In stationary traffic, Martina sat behind the wheel, fretting Leslie would think she’d stood him up and just leave. She called him to explain and apologize. Leslie told her not to worry. He wasn’t going anywhere. An hour and a half later, Martina arrived. “When she walked up, I remember thinking she was even cuter than I remembered,” says Leslie. “When we first met I believe her hair was straight. And at that time it was really curly and I was like, ‘Oh this is really cute.’” Martina and Leslie settled quickly back into the easy conversation they’d enjoyed on the plane. And then, at the end of the night, they realized they were both flying out of Newark Airport the next day. The Easter weekend was approaching, and they were both traveling to visit their families  – Martina was heading back to Ohio and Leslie to Michigan. “So the very next day, we met up at the airport before our flight,” says Martina. “I always say our second date was at the airport.” Over the next few days, Martina and Leslie texted non-stop. Three dates turned into four and then five and then they quickly lost count. “We were constantly in touch,” says Leslie. “It was very easy,” says Martina. “There were no gray areas. We liked each other, and we hung out, we spent time together.” A month or so later, Leslie went to San Francisco for a work trip and Martina joined him for part of the time. It was their first trip together, and was shortly followed by their second – a weekend away with Martina’s friends at a beach house in Delaware. Martina was also busy planning her next big adventure – a trip to Costa Rica in November to coincide with her 30th birthday. She’d invited her closest friends to join her. Only weeks after meeting Leslie, she invited him too. The trip was still months away, and the relationship was still new. It was a little intimidating, but Leslie tried not to worry about this. He knew he wanted things to work out, and wanted to be there. “I’m an overthinker,” he says. “And the more I overthink, the more I stop making moves. I told myself not to overthink this.” There were a couple of bumps in the road – by the summer, Martina was getting frustrated at Leslie’s hesitation to label the relationship. This conversation came to a head in July, three months or so after they’d got together. But after this — their first proper argument – Martina and Leslie confirmed that, yes, they were in a relationship. And yes, they both wanted to see where it went next. And yes, they couldn’t wait. Travel quickly became a cornerstone of Leslie and Martina’s relationship. “We really enjoyed each other and we traveled a lot,” says Leslie. “So that was cool for both of us to have someone to travel with.” Martina was the more adventurous of the two, so she encouraged Leslie to get outside of his comfort zone. The couple realized they traveled well together, with good “synergy,” as they put it. “In a lot of different ways, it just all seemed to work, just seemed like the perfect situation. perfect match for us,” says Leslie. Around a year and a half after their airplane meeting, in December 2016, Leslie and Martina traveled to London together. It was a city that meant a lot to both of them – Martina studied there, while Leslie has family in the UK. Leslie figured London was the perfect location for a proposal. Leslie and Martina had spoken about marriage and both saw it as the next step, so the proposal wouldn’t be a surprise, but Leslie wanted to surprise Martina in the moment. He enlisted the help of his London-based cousins, asking if they could also get a bunch of their friends on board. Leslie arranged that he and Martina would walk by Tower Bridge, a famous London landmark, just as night fell. Once there, they’d be approached by a series of seemingly random strangers, who were actually friends of his cousins on a mission. Each stranger handed Martina a rose and a piece of paper with a letter printed on it. The first two interactions just seemed random and Martina assumed the strangers were trying to get her to buy the roses. Then, people started coming thick and fast and soon the letters spelled out a question: “Will you marry me?” “And once the last person came, I got on my knee and asked her,” says Leslie. Martina was both overwhelmed and delighted. “I was so, so happy. It was an incredible feeling. It was just amazing,” she says. “And what made it even more special to me is that it was in London. “London is where I got my first passport stamp and really opened up my mind and my heart, and is where I truly fell in love with travel. “So then to go back to the very first place where it started – and now I’m getting proposed to by the man that I met on a plane – it was really special.” Martina and Leslie say their wedding day in Columbus, Ohio was “really beautiful.” The theme was “love at first flight,” with this slogan emblazoned on the invites and the menus, and the couple gave guests luggage tags as party favors. Martina Jones became Martina Jones Johnson. Cut to today and travel remains a big part of Martina and Leslie’s lives. They chronicle their adventures on their Instagram account That Couple Who Travels, aiming to inspire others to follow in their footsteps. “I’m so appreciative of the community that we’ve built and the opportunities that we’re able to have from it,” says Martina. Martina and Leslie’s account includes destination guides, flight reviews and recommendations of Black-owned businesses, as well as photographs of the couple on their incredible adventures across the globe. “I do love being a representation of a healthy Black relationship,” says Martina. “I think more people need to see that.” This is important to Martina and Leslie not only in the context of Instagram. Martina recalls a recent group trip where she and Leslie found themselves entirely in the company of older White couples. “These people aren’t around young Black couples. But we just loved each other, we just had such a good time with each other, sharing our different experiences and bonding over travel,” she says. “And that’s what it’s all about. I think that’s how the world gets better. Love is what kills hate and it’s what makes fears go away when you have those relationships with people.” Looking back on the not-actually-a-scam flight, and their fortuitous meeting, leads Leslie to conclude “you just never know what’s out there. “I met someone who lived not too far away from me, but I met them on a plane – thousands or whatever miles away from home,” he says. As for Martina, she finds herself reflecting on something her best friend said to her long before Leslie came into her life: “Do what you love, and it will lead you to everything else.” For Martina, this turned out to be true. “I love to travel. I traveled and I met the love of my life. So, find that thing that you love and you don’t know what breadcrumbs that will lead you to. It might lead you to the love of your life. It might lead you to your purpose – you just don’t know, but we all have unique desires and things that we are passionate about,” says Martina. “Don’t ignore it. Don’t wait for someone else to go with you. Just do what you love and see what happens.”",Travel
She broke up with her boyfriend and moved in with a man she’d known for 3 weeks. Here’s what happened next," Liesbet Collaert was about to blow up her life. She’d arrived in San Francisco, California just three weeks earlier, part of an overland journey across North America with her long-term boyfriend, Karl. Now, Liesbet was about to abandon her travels (unthinkable), abandon the plan (out of character), and abandon Karl (unbelievable). Why? Because Liesbet had fallen in love with someone else, and she couldn’t shake the thought that she was meant to be with him. It was 2004 and Liesbet was 28. She’d met her American boyfriend Karl a couple of years earlier, on a trip to Australia. Back in her home country of Belgium, Liesbet was a trained teacher, but while she enjoyed her job, her thirst for adventure superseded everything else. Liesbet was always working out ways she could work from the road, always figuring out her next trip. “Travel has always been number one,” Liesbet tells CNN Travel today. When Liesbet and Karl pulled up in San Francisco, they planned to only stay for a week. They were crashing with a friend of Karl’s – a guy called Nik who owned a San Francisco townhouse he’d converted into three apartments. Nik lived in one of the studios, and he rented out the others. That first day, after greeting Nik and dumping her bag in his apartment, Liesbet headed back downstairs to grab a CD from the campervan. “As I come into the yard, I get greeted by two beautiful, amazing, fluffy dogs wagging their tails,” recalls Liesbet. “And of course, I was totally enamored with them, hanging out with them…” When Liesbet looked up, she noticed a man standing in the doorway of the ground floor apartment, smiling at her. “Hi, I’m Mark,” he said. “Mark Kilty.” He was the dogs’ owner, and one of Nik’s tenants – the occupant of the downstairs apartment. Liesbet introduced herself, explaining she and her boyfriend were staying with Nik for a few days. “We talked a little bit – and a little bit turned into an hour,” recalls Liesbet. Liesbet’s first impression of Mark was that he was “a very attractive, tall, dark-haired man” (“I was attracted to his looks more than anything else,” she admits.) But after their extended conversation, Liesbet decided Mark was also “very well-spoken and intelligent.” Mark was 33 and recently divorced. He’d grown up on the East Coast of the US, but moved to California in the late 1990s – he was a software engineer and had arrived just in time for the dot-com boom. Mark was pretty happy with his life – separating from his wife hadn’t been easy, but he loved his work, his dogs and his life in the Bay Area. But when Liesbet talked about her myriad travels and her nomadic lifestyle, Mark was immediately fascinated. It was like she’d opened up a window to a life he’d never even considered, but was immediately enthralled by. “Probably my first real attraction to her in any way was just that she was a bit of a free spirit, and someone who was willing to risk a structured, normal life for having a good experience,” Mark tells CNN Travel today. “I was very intrigued with her lifestyle, and what she was able to accomplish with relatively little financially – and how much she had been able to see places and go places and experience things.” Liesbet crossed paths with Mark multiple times over the course of the next few days. It turned out Mark was good friends with his landlord Nik, and so Mark, Nik, Liesbet and Karl often hung out together. “We went out for drinks,” recalls Liesbet, “Mark was a sailor and took us all out sailing. The group grew a little closer.” Mark liked Liesbet, but he was conscious of not crossing any lines – she and Karl seemed pretty committed. But as the days rolled on and the week in San Francisco turned into three, Mark’s feelings began to spill over, and he started to suspect they were reciprocated. As for Liesbet, the time in San Francisco just felt surreal. She knew she was falling for Mark. And she didn’t know what to do about it. “Karl was really looking forward to the next step of our trip – we were going to meet my parents at some point in California, and then we’re going to go to Mexico,” recalls Liesbet. “And every time he brought that up, I was… I was quiet.” Karl encouraged Liesbet and Mark to spend time together – it’d be just him and Liesbet for the next several months, so he figured it was nice for them both to enjoy other social interactions while they could. “The more time progressed, it was more and more emotionally laden, like my heart would beat harder as we sat next to each other on the couch, talking,” recalls Liesbet. The night before Liesbet was due to leave, she and Mark found themselves alone in his apartment. Mark was showing her photo albums from his college years, and the two of them were sharing stories about their lives before they’d met. “At some point, he put his arm around me, and I just remember my heart going faster. And I think I turned. And I think that’s how it happened,” says Liesbet. “We kissed,” says Mark. “We were both glad about it, but we felt bad about it also. Because obviously, she was in a relationship. And I’m pretty sure she was leaving the next day.” When Liesbet left that evening, the only acknowledgment of what happened was Mark’s parting words: “If you ever break it off with Karl, just let me know where you are, and no matter where you are, I’ll come pick you up,” he said. The next day, Liesbet and Karl prepared to say goodbye to San Francisco. Mark went to work, knowing they’d be gone by the time he got back. As she helped Karl pack the camper, Liesbet battled a mounting feeling of dread. She didn’t know what the future held. But she knew she couldn’t carry on with Karl, pretending her feelings for Mark meant nothing. She decided she had to tell Karl the truth. “I have feelings for Mark,” she said. “I think I’ll end up coming back here.” She tried to sound confident and determined, masking the fear, sadness and confusion she felt. Karl seemed shocked, but didn’t try to persuade her to stay with him. “He was very heartbroken,” recalls Liesbet. “He simply said, ‘If you think you’re going to come back, you’d better just stay.’” So instead of getting into the RV together and driving on, Liesbet and Karl went to the bank and split up their finances. Then she took all her belongings out of the campervan and said goodbye to her boyfriend of three years. “That was a very, very hard emotional time for both of us,” says Liesbet. She watched Karl drive off in the RV, wiping away tears. Then she headed back into the apartment block, let herself into Mark’s apartment and dumped her stuff in the corner. Feeling emotionally and physically exhausted, she climbed onto Mark’s bed, comforted by his two dogs. “Then for the rest of the day, I cried,” says Liesbet. “It was not an easy decision.” Several hours later, when Mark came home from work, the first thing he noticed was that the campervan was gone. His heart sank. “I’ll probably never hear from her again,” he thought. Shaking off the thought, he parked his car and headed into the building. “I go up to the apartment door and the door was unlocked, which was a little bit odd,” recalls Mark. He stepped inside, expecting to be greeted by his dogs, who usually waited for him at the door. Instead, they came out of the bedroom. “They were wagging and happy to see me and I sort of got down on the ground with them – as I do with dogs – and hung out with them and petted them.” Mark comforted himself with the dogs’ affections, pushing thoughts of Liesbet out of his mind. “And then, I don’t know, four seconds later, five seconds later – Liesbet steps out from the bedroom door.” Mark jumped, looking at her in disbelief, then swore loudly. “My jaw hit the ground,” he says. “I was just in shock.” Liesbet interpreted Mark’s reaction as an indication she’d made a “massive mistake.” “Maybe this was not such a good idea,” she thought. The tears which had been falling freely all day threatened to start up again. But then Mark got up and embraced her, giving her a long hug. They stood, arms around each other, for a long while. Then, softly, Mark asked why she was there. “I decided to stay,” said Liesbet. That’s how Liesbet moved in with Mark after knowing him for just a few weeks. After Mark got over the initial shock, he was thrilled and the two spent the next few weeks in a happy daze. “There were a lot of emotions and a lot of excitement,” says Mark. “There was the romance of being together, and actually being able to express our emotions for each other,” adds Liesbet. It wasn’t all perfect – Liesbet still “felt guilty and bad about Karl.” She also questioned her decision to abandon the overland adventure. “In the past, I had left boyfriends for my travels,” she says. “With Mark, it was the opposite – I was abandoning my travels for a man, so I struggled with that.” Plus, there were logistical issues at play – Liesbet’s tourist visa only allowed her to stay in the US for another month. She couldn’t just live, jobless and visaless, in Mark’s apartment for the foreseeable future, nor did she want to. But neither she nor Mark felt able to make any long-term plans just yet. In the end, Liesbet applied for a visa extension, which was granted, and the two put thoughts of the long term to one side and decided to just enjoy the moment. About a month after she’d moved in with Mark, Liesbet flew with him to the East Coast to meet his family. A few months after that, Liesbet’s parents came to visit. Their respective families took the sudden change in circumstances pretty well, and everyone got on. As time went on, Liesbet and Mark started talking about potential adventures they could go on together when Liesbet’s US visa ran out. As a keen sailor, Mark had always dreamed of spending an extended period on the water. Liesbet was prone to seasickness, but she was willing to give life on the ocean a try. She was excited that Mark seemed up for an adventure, and as much as she was enjoying San Francisco, she had itchy feet. So, in 2005, Mark quit his job and the couple bought a sailboat, planning to sail around the California coast towards South America. “It was definitely a big leap of faith,” says Mark. Unfortunately the adventure got off to a bumpy start. Liesbet badly struggled with her seasickness, while Mark’s dogs hated being on the water. After just two days at sea, the couple made the decision to abandon the boat, put it up for sale and purchase a campervan instead. “Ironically, I was ‘back on plan’ but with a different boyfriend and two dogs,” says Liesbet. Liesbet and Mark spent the next year driving through Central America, traveling to Panama, and then back up to Texas. The beginning, says Mark, was a “honeymoon period.” “You’re just enjoying the company and the relationship growing and those kinds of things,” he says. “But we definitely hit a bump.” Liesbet could feel Mark pulling away. “He wasn’t really holding my hand,” she recalls. “There was something about him that felt a little off.” The situation worsened. And then, when they reached Honduras, Mark said he wanted to end things. Liesbet could have left there and then, and flown back to Belgium. But something made her stay. And so for the last few months of the trip, she and Mark lived together, broken up, in the tight confines of the campervan. Both of them were lonely, and both of them struggled. They reached Texas, where they’d arranged to stay with Karl – yes, Liesbet’s ex-boyfriend Karl. It was now over a year since Liesbet ended things with him, and he was now dating someone else, living happily in Austin. When they’d made the arrangement, Liesbet and Mark were in love. Now it was just awkward. “Mark stayed in the campervan in Karl’s drive, and I was staying in Karl’s spare bedroom,” says Liesbet, adding it was “all very ironic.” Things got worse before they got better – one day Mark drove off, without telling Liesbet, and she had no idea if he would ever come back. Three days passed, and then she got a call from him, out of the blue. “I really regret my decision,” Mark said. “I want us to start over.” Today, Mark thinks the break-up was the result of him feeling overwhelmed – his life had changed so quickly and so drastically, and spending 24 hours a day with someone in a tight space isn’t easy. But when he drove off, alone, in Austin, he had “a lot of time to think about what I want to do and who I would like to do it with.” “Everything sort of pointed back to her,” he says. Liesbet and Mark reunited, but this time they thought long and hard before diving in. “When we got back together, we had some very long conversations about what we could improve in our relationship, about things that we each needed, personally, to make this work for both of us so that we can have a good relationship, but also so we can both, as individuals, be in a better place,” says Mark. From there, Liesbet and Mark continued traveling together and both started working freelance on the road. They decided to give the sailing dream another shot – this time buying a bigger boat, a catamaran, which was more stable and comfortable for both Liesbet and the dogs. The couple sailed to the Bahamas, then towards the Dominican Republic. Later, they sailed down the Panama Canal and on the Galapagos Islands to French Polynesia. Throughout this experience, Liesbet and Mark operated as “a team,” says Liesbet. In 2007, Liesbet and Mark got married. Their first celebration was a small, simple legal ceremony, with just a couple of friends as witnesses. Three years later, they had a larger wedding party with all their loved ones in St. Maarten. During the ceremony, Mark belatedly proposed – he’d never officially done so in 2007, and it felt only fitting to do so now, in front of Liesbet’s friends and family. It was, says Liesbet, both “funny and romantic.” One day in 2014, Mark was alone on the catamaran when he noticed a lump on his chest, just above his right nipple. Earlier that week, Mark had also tripped and bumped his right chest. “It hurt a lot more than I thought it should hurt,” he recalls. This, combined with the lump, set off alarm bells in Mark’s mind. The year before, his sister had passed away from ovarian cancer. What were the chances of him also having cancer? And what were the chances of him having what looked like male breast cancer? He pushed the thoughts out of his mind, mentioning the lump to Liesbet briefly, in passing, when she got home. But a month later, Mark and Liesbet decided the lump “wasn’t really noticeably getting worse, but it wasn’t getting better.” A biopsy in a hospital in Tahiti confirmed Mark had a type of breast cancer. “Your whole world shatters when you hear those words, ‘You have cancer,’” says Mark. “You don’t believe it at first,” says Liesbet. The two also struggled with the relative rarity of a male breast cancer diagnosis. “It was a big emotional rollercoaster the first few weeks,” says Mark. Mark returned to the US for treatment. He didn’t struggle too much physically, but he found the emotional side tough, “especially just after losing my sister a year ago, having that fresh in my mind of what cancer does, intimately, in a family relationship.” He felt “elation” when he was eventually given the all-clear. “But there’s definitely a lot of elements of depression that go with that kind of diagnosis in that kind of situation, because it haunts you for the rest of your life,” he says. Today, Mark manages his fears and uncertainties as best he can. “I’m very fortunate that it turned out the way that it did. I don’t know if lucky is the right word. But you might say that,” he says. Mark and Liesbet supported each other through Mark’s illness. Then, when Mark was finished with treatment, they started wondering what to do next. They still wanted adventure, but felt the need for a new chapter. They left behind sailing and started traveling North America house-sitting and pet-sitting. Later, they bought another campervan and got back on the road again, traveling further afield once more. Fast forward to today, and nearly twenty years after they first met, Mark and Liesbet are still traveling the world together. They document their travels on their blog, Roaming About, and Liesbet also published a travel memoir called “Plunge – One Woman’s Pursuit of a Life Less Ordinary.” The couple don’t see themselves settling in one place any time soon, but they have a mental list of places they’ve visited and loved that they could see themselves perhaps returning to one day. Liesbet and Mark still see themselves as a strong team. Traveling the world and navigating difficulties along the way, especially Mark’s illness, has only forged them closer together over the decades. “These are big, life-changing emotional things that happened to us,” says Liesbet. “I think because of the downs that we’ve had, we did grow closer and we can face pretty much everything right now, to be honest, and I know that sounds grand or whatever – but I think we can handle a lot as a couple right now.” Looking back on their life together, Mark says he simply feels “joy and happiness, and contentment.” “I can’t imagine anyone else that I would have ever gone on the last 20 years of my life with, and this adventure we’ve been on,” he says. For Liesbet, their story illustrates the importance of living life with no regrets. She’s never regretted her spontaneous decision to stay behind with Mark in San Francisco – even if it hadn’t worked out, she knew she had to give life with Mark a go. “I feel like you shouldn’t regret things that you could have tried,” she says. “I feel things are worth a try.”",Travel
A short history of the long fight over breakfast tacos," Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of habañero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There’s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN “Searching for Mexico” series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León. There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years. “The breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it’s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,” narrates Longoria. CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel – born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years – to find out more. “When I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.” Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as “a really fast food, but not a junkie food.” Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo León are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings. Some of the city’s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you’re in meat country. Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey. Compañia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came “to work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.” And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. “I think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.” Along with Doña Mary’s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you’re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony’s Tacos. The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. “No Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,” says José Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. “It comes from Mexico – where exactly, it’s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.” As for today, “they’re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, which all border Texas,” he said. Eddie Vega – who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state – is known as “Taco Poet of Texas.” He points out that historically, what’s now south Texas was once part of Mexico. Before 1836, “the border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.” Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren’t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. “When you get to south Texas, and I’m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It’s not something we’d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody’s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.” Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has “a great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,” Ralat said. “They try some options, and then in their minds, they think it’s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff … and let history speak for itself.” Ralat said San Antonio has “a bit of an inferiority complex that they’re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it’s more diverse, and the food is better.” “To be clear, they’re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they’re also border food. When the Eater article came out” – championing Austin as “home” of the breakfast taco – “San Antonians lost their minds.” Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. “I don’t know that one city – San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo – can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.” Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. “I think at this point we’ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,” Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “Is there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.” She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco. She also points out the regional differences within Texas. “A flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.” Ralat said he’s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there. “I hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. … I want the food to be high quality. I don’t want it to be spin.” Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them – with or without huevos (eggs). “Breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,” she said. “Bean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn’t have eggs. … Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn’t require eggs. Barbacoa – made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks – is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.” In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? “Part of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you’ve part of that conversation for a long time.” Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said. “I think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey … and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.” They’re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. “The place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.” For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. “I think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. “It’s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let’s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That’s so nice. And it’s just so joyful.”",Travel
All the restaurants and locations Eva Longoria visits in ‘Searching for Mexico’," You’ll no doubt be hungry after watching “Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.” Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria’s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict – and the collision of food cultures. “The people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,” Longoria said. • Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. • Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Café La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. • She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. • Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hernández Medel at Chuchumbé, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city’s African slave era. • It’s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. • At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Doña Marta. She’s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. •  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Doña Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalapeño. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. • At Tortas Ahogadas El Príncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada – the region’s beloved “drowned” sandwich. • In Guadalajara’s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs Óscar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas Díaz. • Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. • Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara’s Colonia Americana neighborhood. • At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. • Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren’t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. • Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. • Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo León is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it’s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas. • In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Gutiérrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region’s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there’s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. • Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. “These are the best tortillas I’ve ever had,” said Longoria. • El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo León with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They’re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. • Dona Lupita’s Café, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. • La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. • Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo León. Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know. A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan “pizzas”), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. “It is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I’ve been to in the world,” Longoria said. • Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles – complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients. • Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca’s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. • At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Florián made Longoria quesillo – a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. • In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it “the perfect combination.” • The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine. • In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Doña Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. • La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios García is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it’s the “perfect dish.” Here’s the recipe. Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucatán, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico. The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region’s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. • Ixi’im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucatán, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronzón slow-cooks pork underground after it’s marinated in sour orange and spices. • Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in Mérida. • At Huniik, which means “unique spirit” in Maya, chef Roberto Solís makes onion tempura with black recado. “I have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it’s delicious,” said Longoria. • In his home in Xocén, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pixán, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means “food for the souls.” The food honoring the dead “can easily be carried back to the underworld,” he said. • Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in Mérida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. “I’d have this as my last meal on Earth,” said Longoria. Here’s the recipe. • At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours. • Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it’s made: “It’s crazy, it’s crowded, it’s noisy – and I love it!” Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitlán until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: • Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping. • El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. • Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos. • Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria’s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela Cámara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. • Máximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo “Lalo” García. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. • Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. • Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates. • El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. • Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo López whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.

"‘I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.’ He survived, and here’s his advice"," Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic. They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees. Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath.  When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said. What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker. Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”",Travel
"How to survive a bear attack – or better yet, avoid one altogether"," You’re out for a hike on a crisp fall day. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers. “I stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn’t a threatening gesture,” she told CNN Travel. “I’m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, ‘just go on your way,’ and went back to eating.” “And I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.” When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she’s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years – and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there. Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt’s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. “A wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It’s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.” Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen: • A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023 but is expected to make a full recovery. • Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada’s Banff National Park in late September 2023. • An adult grizzly bear that had killed a woman this past summer was euthanized in early September 2023 after breaking into a home through a kitchen window with her cub. • A man in his 60s was killed by a bear in Arizona as he sat at his campsite in June 2023. • Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. • A 70-year-old hunter was seriously injured by a bear in France in November 2021. All illustrate the point that rare doesn’t equal never. While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. “It’s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.” She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears. “They eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that’s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it’s easy calories.” Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. “If more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there’s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,” Pratt said. The key is being prepared – and that’s where Pratt and others in the know come in. The best strategy is to never get in harm’s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That’s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don’t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine. Other tips: • Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. • Walk with a group (we’re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. • If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. • Don’t put yourself between cubs and their mother. •  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don’t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it’s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear. If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make – and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, “please don’t run. Bears can outrun anybody,” Pratt said. “Don’t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.” New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: • Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. • Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms. • If you’re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation. You’re now in the rarest of situations – you’ve attracted a bear’s attention. It didn’t move off. It’s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you’re about to be attacked. What’s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear. If it’s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. “You want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,” Pratt said. “Throw things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back – aim for the face.” If you’re dealing with a grizzly that won’t back off and an attack is imminent, you’re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. “Act as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,” Pratt said. “Tuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.” NPS elaborates: “Remain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.” Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort – “your Hail Mary pass” as Pratt called it – when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you’re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you’re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that’s going to be a black bear. But if you’re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That’s when it’s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can’t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org. One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don’t. She also said the face shapes are different. “Black bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.” This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world – from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country. Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has a helpful video and tips on using spray to ward off bears. She’s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you’re inexperienced. “Taking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.” A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn’t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that “Yelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.” If you’re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, “avoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.” Other tips and cautions: • Don’t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. • Don’t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. • Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. “A fed bear is a dead bear.” Pratt emphasized it’s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. “The bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,” she said. “The bears’ lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.”",Travel
"How to survive a shark attack – or better yet, avoid one entirely"," First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon. But sharks do occasionally attack humans – and they certainly make news when they do: •  Rockaway Beach Park in Queens, New York, was closed to swimming and surfing on August 8, one day after a woman was hospitalized after suffering an apparent shark bite. •  A teenager was bitten by a shark on the foot in early July as he was surfing off the coast of New York’s Fire Island. • A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 8. • A shark attacked a woman from Connecticut while she was snorkeling at a resort in Turks and Caicos on May 24. While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there’s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File found only 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 confirmed, provoked bites in 2022 worldwide. Think about it a minute – the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 89 bites were logged. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher. In 2022, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 41; Florida had the highest state total at 16. That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel. Know your environment Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors. “If you’re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,” said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School. “Fortunately, humans aren’t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.” Still, there are places you’re more likely to encounter a shark. River mouths are not the best place to swim You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society. Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks. “An awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river – people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,” said Peirce. Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out. Avoid areas with fishing Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says “forget it.” “Whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,” he said. Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That’s a possible sign a shark might be nearby. He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore. Avoid dusk and dawn Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it’s also the time when a shark attack is most likely. “A lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,” Peirce says, “due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.” Hang with lifeguards Chris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to “do your homework” before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places. If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource. “I always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It’s a lot safer,” he said. Don’t wear shiny objects in the water “Be careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.” Lowe said. In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. “And you don’t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.” Follow your instincts “Probably the most important thing is to follow your gut,” Hammerschlag said. “If you feel wary about getting in the water … just don’t go in the water.” “A lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn’t listen to it,” he said. Don’t panic So you’re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. “Don’t start splashing around – you’re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark’s interest,” said Peirce. Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose. “A shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it’s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,” said Peirce. “That’s why we often get exploratory bites which don’t result in death and sometimes don’t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you’re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.” Maintain eye contact As the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact. “Sharks are ambush predators,” Peirce explained. “If you’re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it’s not going to be half as comfortable as if it’s able to sneak up from behind.” Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you’re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore. If you’re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. “Let the shark know it’s being watched.” Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand. “You’re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,” Fragola says in the video. Stay big or get small This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce. “The bigger you are in the water, the more respect you’ll get,” he said. But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce’s advice is to roll up into a ball. “If a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,” he explained. “If I didn’t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor – and if it wasn’t showing massive interest in me – I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.” Don’t play dead This isn’t a bear, it’s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots – but be careful where you aim. “There’s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That’s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,” said Peirce. “This is a moving object in the water and you’re not staying still either, so what you don’t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.” A good shot to the gills can also do the job: “The gills are very sensitive – giving a shark a whack in the gills isn’t a bad idea.” Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon. “If you’re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you’re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,” Peirce says. “I’ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it’s (been) enough to use a shark billy – a small metal rod between two and three feet long – and I’ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.” It’s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you’ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten. Cut off the angles If you’re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can’t get behind you, says Peirce. “Keep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you’ve only got one direction to look. You’re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.” Slowly back away Displace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore. “You must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you’ve got to be careful – large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.” Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim. “If a white shark is in full attack mode, there’s not much you’re going to be able to do at that point,” he says.",Travel
Han Kwang Song: North Korean striker scores in World Cup qualifier after vanishing from world soccer for over three years," After more than three years of going missing from world soccer, North Korean striker Han Kwang Song has reappeared, playing for his country in two recent World Cup qualifiers and scoring in the 6-1 win over Myanmar on Tuesday. Han first featured for the Chollima against Syria on November 16 – a match played in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah – wearing a white away uniform with the North Korean flag on his chest and the number 10 on his back. Attempting to qualify for the World Cup for a third time, North Korea lost 1-0. Han then started and scored a powerful header in the 38th minute for the nation in its dominating win against Myanmar in the Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon. After playing for Qatar club Al-Duhail on August 21, 2020, the young striker – who came to world prominence after playing for a number of Italian soccer teams – had gone missing, nowhere to be seen or heard of. A CNN investigation found that he had returned to Rome when he was deported from Qatar in early 2021 and had stayed at an unspecified North Korean embassy until flights back to Pyongyang resumed just this August. It is unclear when and how he returned home. The North Korea football federation, the Asian Football Confederation and world soccer governing body FIFA didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on Han’s return to international football. The return of the North Korean wunderkind has surprised soccer pundits and fans, who worried about his safety and promising career being cut short. Max Canzi, who coached Han at Serie A club Cagliari’s Under-19 team, said he is “very happy” for the striker to return. “Very curious about the level of his performance after being out for so much time,” Canzi told CNN Sport, after learning that Han had reappeared in the loss against Syria. Han’s former teammate Nicholas Pennington at Cagliari told CNN Sport: “Hopefully, Han stays in the spotlight and the fact that there is concern helps him get back to where he should be.” Listed in the roster for North Korea’s World Cup qualifiers against Syria and Myanmar were not just Han, but also Pak Kwang Ryong and Choe Song Hyok – who played for Austria’s SKN St. Pölten and Italy’s SS Arezzo, respectively, until they were forced to stop due to the UN sanctions that ordered the repatriation of all overseas North Korean workers by the end of 2019. In 2017, Han became the first North Korean to score a goal in one of Europe’s five major soccer leagues and even made a shock transfer to Italian giant Juventus in 2019, then later to Qatar’s Al-Duhail. The young striker from Pyongyang quickly drew attention from soccer pundits and fans – not just for his unique background, but for his technical prowess as well. But his promising career was cut short when he disappeared from the world soccer stage in 2020, leaving fans with a question: “Where in the world was Han?” Han’s career was affected by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) imposing sanctions against North Korea for conducting its sixth nuclear test in 2017. The sanctions ordered member states to repatriate all North Korean nationals working in their respective jurisdictions amid concerns that foreign money was being transferred to support Kim Jong Un’s nuclear and weapons programs. The UNSC resolution set the end of 2019 as the deadline for repatriation. The Covid-19 pandemic led to North Korea fully sealing its borders, making it impossible for Han and fellow repatriated North Korean nationals to return home. He had been due to fly out of Qatar in 2021 in accordance with the UN sanctions – but then vanished. A CNN investigation into his story shed new light on his disappearance. After joining Al-Duhail in January 2020, in the middle of the Qatar Stars League 2019/20 season, Han went on to play in 10 league games, scoring three goals and playing a significant role in the club’s league title win. Qatar had signed the North Korean on a five-year, $4.6 million (€4,310,000) contract until the 2023/24 season; as such, Han was remunerated around $296,200 (€270,000) between February and April 2020, according to the UNSC report of the Panel of Experts from mid-2020. Though Han was performing admirably on the pitch, questions remained over whether he was sending money back to his homeland, as the UNSC said of other North Koreans working abroad. The UN document shows Han had signed a pledge to a Qatari bank to not transfer “any money cost or amount to North Korea in any cases.” Although it is unclear in Han’s case whether he had been sending money back to the Kim regime, it is widely reported that North Korea often forces its workers abroad to send money to the government back home. The UNSC Panel of Experts in another report released in March 2020 said it was investigating North Korean nationals suspected of earning income overseas, which also include “specialists, such as sports players.” Han’s last game for Al-Duhail was on August 21, 2020, when he came off the bench against Al-Ahli in the season finale. It would be the last time soccer fans would see Han play on the professional level until now. By the time the new season kicked off the following month, Han was gone – no longer in the starting line-up nor on the bench, with no news emerging of any transfer. Months passed without any update regarding Han’s whereabouts until a UNSC final report of the Panel of Experts released in March 2021 confirmed that the player’s contract had been terminated with Al-Duhail earlier that year and he was deported from Qatar. Han boarded a Qatar Airways flight from Doha on January 26, 2021, when he was deported, according to a letter attached in the UNSC’s final report of the Panel of Experts. However, as Han could not return home due to North Korea closing its borders because of the pandemic, the flight took him back to Rome. Before playing for North Korea against Syria in last week’s World Cup qualifier, Han was last reported to be living in an unspecified North Korean embassy in 2021, awaiting the resumption of flights back to Pyongyang, according to another official close to the issue. In May 2021, North Korea pulled out of qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and didn’t take part in the Tokyo Summer Olympics or the Beijing Winter Games, officially citing the coronavirus pandemic. “North Korea has been barred from competing at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as part of its punishment for its ‘unilateral decision’ to drop out of the Tokyo Games this summer,” the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in 2021. The already-isolated country had fully shut its borders when the pandemic began in 2020 and has only recently lifted the restrictions to bring back its nationals living abroad like Han, who was stranded with no way to return home all this time. Then this past September, Pyongyang sent a large number of athletes to Hangzhou, China, for the 2022 Asian Games, which was postponed a year due to the pandemic. Unlike the women’s team, which reached the soccer final of the Asian Games before losing to Japan, North Korea’s men’s national team has had relatively poor results in international competitions. While the women’s team will be remembered for its impressive campaign – notably beating South Korea 4-1 – the men’s team made an embarrassing exit after receiving six yellow cards and fiercely confronting the referees after falling to Japan 2-1 in quarterfinal.",Sports
Baseball great Ichiro Suzuki throws shutout against a high school girls’ team in Japan," He may have retired from professional baseball four years ago, but Ichiro Suzuki certainly hasn’t lost his appetite for the game. Likely a future Hall of Famer for his stellar Major League Baseball (MLB) career as an outfielder, Ichiro, 50, not only still likes to play, but he’s doing it as a pitcher. A Japanese high school girls’ team found out just how well he can throw during Ichiro’s annual All-Star game on Tuesday. The game, which was first played two years ago, was set up to encourage women to play baseball in Japan – and Ichiro was certainly all in. According to MLB.com, Ichiro threw a 116-pitch, complete game shutout and struck out nine in the 4-0 victory at the Tokyo Dome. He even dusted off an 86-miles-per-hour fastball during the game which, in truth, might give some of the best hitters in the world something to think about. Ichiro was joined in the game by former MLB pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka – who played for the Boston Red Sox and New York Mets – and retired from professional baseball in 2021, with the pair excited to show off their skills once again. As well as his prowess from the mound, Ichiro also picked up two hits in the game – a relief given he went hitless during the last two years of the exhibition contest, according to MLB.com. “Personally, I am glad to be able to make a hit. I would like to continue training in hopes to motivate the female athletes,” Ichiro said after the game, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. The Japanese great certainly inspired the opposition during the game, both with his exploits as well as being struck out by Okayama Gakugeikan High School’s Ryona Domae in one inning, leading the aspiring young athlete to beam with excitement. “I was really looking forward to this match with Ichiro. I was determined to get a win, but the fact that I got to strike him out is a memory I will cherish forever,” Domae said on Japan’s TBS Sports. “Knowing that I was able to strike out Ichiro, I think I can compete with confidence in future matches.” Ichiro praised the pitcher, saying to an ecstatic Domae: “I had a weird feeling [being struck out] – I typically have very few strike outs. You should be proud of yourself.” Ichiro’s professional debut came with the Orix Blue Wave of Japan’s Pacific League on July 11, 1992. He played in Japan from 1992-2000, winning three consecutive MVP awards and seven straight batting titles. When he made the move to the Seattle Mariners in 2001 – becoming the first Japanese position player to sign with an MLB team – Ichiro emphatically made his mark. He went on to win the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards that year, becoming just the second player ever to win both honors in the same season. From 2001-2010, Ichiro won 10 consecutive Gold Glove Awards and made 10 straight trips to the All-Star Game. In 2016, he recorded his 3,000th MLB hit to join an elite list of players to reach such a landmark. In addition to the Mariners, Ichiro played for the New York Yankees and Miami Marlins in his MLB career. For fans itching for more of Ichiro on the field after Tuesday’s game, the baseball great had some good news as he emphasised that the series would continue. “I felt the energy of everyone and it was the most happiest moment me – and I believe it was for Matsuzaka and the high school team as well. Thank you so much everyone,” he added. “But especially for the high school female athletes who will continue on with this sport, in hopes that I can be their motivation. I will continue my training and so will Matsuzaka. I want to do this again next year at the Tokyo Dome!”",Sports
"LeBron James becomes the first NBA player to score 39,000 points as LA Lakers clinch In-Season Tournament knockout spot"," Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James reached yet another milestone in his legendary career on Tuesday night as he became the first player in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to score 39,000 career points. During the first quarter of the Lakers’ 131-99 home win against the Utah Jazz, James knocked down a three-pointer in the first quarter to make scoring history at the Crypto.com Arena. James previously broke the all-time mark of 38,387 – held by fellow Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – in February this year and is now in uncharted territory. According to the NBA, his current scoring pace suggests that he is on track to reach 40,000 points later this season. “I got congratulated by my teammates and coaches, (but) I haven’t had an opportunity to really wrap my head around what that means,” James said after the game, per the NBA. “There’s been so many great players that came across this league since the beginning of time, and so many great scorers. To be able to accomplish something that’s the first of anything, I think that’s always pretty cool. It’s a wild moment, that’s for sure.” With the very same bucket, the ‘King’ also notched another landmark achievement. James made his 2,291st three-pointer, moving him past Vince Carter and up to seventh in the all-time list. The 21-year veteran scored two more threes on the night and posted 17 points, seven rebounds and nine assists as the Lakers ran out comfortable winners in their final Group Play game of the NBA’s new In-Season Tournament. Having gone 4-0 in West Group A, the Purple and Gold have sealed a spot in the knockout round of the tournament. Given the ever increasing history that the 38-year-old continues to make, it is perhaps serendipitous that it will all now be documented in one place. LeBron James’ Home Court, a museum dedicated to James and his milestones, will open in the Ohio native’s hometown of Akron on November 25th. According to the NBA, the museum will be a “multimedia experience” and feature items and exhibitions from his childhood, his high school basketball days and his NBA career. The items on show include the famous all-white suit James wore on NBA Draft day in 2003 and an original backboard and rim from St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, where he became arguably the most anticipated prospect in the history of the sport. “My dream was always to put Akron on the map, so to have a place in my hometown that allows me to share my journey with my fans from all over the world means a lot to me,” James said. “I’ve been known to hang on to a lot of things over the years, and I always knew there would be a time and place to bring them out.”",Sports
Cricket’s governing body announces new regulations excluding some trans women from international women’s cricket," The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced Tuesday that “any Male to Female participants who have been through any form of male puberty,” will not be allowed to partake in international women’s cricket. In the announcement, the ICC did not define its criteria for “male puberty.” CNN has reached out to the ICC seeking more detail. The ICC said that what it called the new “gender eligibility regulations” for international cricket came following a “9-month consultation process with the sport’s stakeholders.” The review was led by the ICC Medical Advisory Committee. “The new policy is based on the following principles (in order of priority), protection of the integrity of the women’s game, safety, fairness and inclusion, and this means any Male to Female participants who have been through any form of male puberty will not be eligible to participate in the international women’s game regardless of any surgery or gender reassignment treatment they may have undertaken,” the ICC said in its statement. In recent years, some forms of gender affirming care for trans youth, like puberty blockers, have become more common. But many adult trans women today did not have access to care that would delay or prevent the hormonal changes associated with puberty in their youth, and these women would thus be excluded from competition under the new guidelines. ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice added that the priority of the ICC was to “protect the integrity” of international women’s cricket. “The changes to the gender eligibility regulations resulted from an extensive consultation process and is founded in science and aligned with the core principles developed during the review,” said Allardice in the statement. “Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women’s game and the safety of players,” added Allardice. Mainstream science does not support the claim of athletic advantage in trans women over cisgender women. A 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found “no direct or consistent research” on trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, and critics say the bans add to the discrimination trans people face. Debate in the scientific community about whether androgenic hormones like testosterone serve as useful markers of athletic advantage remains ongoing. The ICC statement confirmed that these changes only apply to international women’s cricket and that eligibility in domestic cricket will be decided by each individual member association. Athlete Ally, a nonprofit LGBTQ athletic advocacy group, said it was “deeply concerned by International Cricket Council’s policy banning transgender women from competing in international competitions because it is motivated by politics, not by science or by true interest in centering athlete health and safety.” “At the most elite levels, policies to promote fairness have been in place for decades, with no issue. The group added: “Policies like the ICC’s that ban transgender women are motivated by misinformation and fear. “Leading voices for women’s sports, including The Women’s Sports Foundation, agree that protecting the integrity of women’s sports entails addressing unequal pay, rampant sexual abuse, and a lack of resources for women athletes — and that targeting transgender athletes does nothing to address these issues. “The sexism underlying these policies hurts all women, and we support the rights of all women to compete in women’s sports.”",Sports
Brazil vs. Argentina: Historic World Cup qualifier is overshadowed by violence and chaos at the Maracanã stadium," Brazil suffered its first ever home World Cup qualifying defeat on Tuesday, as Argentina earned a 1-0 win on a night of violence and chaos at the iconic Maracanã stadium. Defender Nicolas Otamendi’s towering header on 63 minutes secured a historic three points for Argentina and condemned Brazil to a third straight qualifying defeat for the first time in the Seleção’s history. However, the match was overshadowed by violence in the stands which delayed the start of the World Cup qualifier. After fighting broke out between the two sets of fans – which were seated together at one end of the stadium – during the national anthems, Brazilian police moved in to quell the violence but their heavy-handed approach with the Argentine supporters incensed Lionel Messi and the rest of the national team. The Inter Miami forward first led his teammates over to the stand where the fighting was taking place and pleaded with both the police and Argentina fans – some of who were seen throwing ripped out seats at the security officials – for calm. Some pictures show crying children in the stands, with one woman carrying a child in her arms as she tries to clamber over the seats and away from the violence. In one remarkable moment, Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez climbed up onto the stand and pulled the arm of a police officer to try and prevent him from using his baton on an Argentina fan. Messi then led the team off the pitch and back into the changing rooms where they stayed for 10 minutes. The match eventually kicked off 30 minutes late. In a statement published to its website, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said mixed fans is “standard” in matches organized by FIFA – soccer’s world governing body – and South American football’s governing body CONMEBOL. “This is not a model invented or imposed by the CBF,” the statement added. The CBF said 1,050 private security guards and 700 military police officers “worked to secure the match.” “Therefore, the CBF reaffirms that the action, security and operation plan for the match were strictly followed, as approved by the RJ Military Police and other authorities.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday there is “absolutely no place for violence” in football. “Such events, as seen during the World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina at the Maracanã stadium, have no place in our sport or society,” he said in a statement. “Without exception, all players, fans, staff and officials have to be safe and secure to enjoy and play football, and I call on all the relevant authorities to ensure that this is respected at all levels.” Brazil’s state military police said in a statement that its officers were “involved in a scuffle among fans,” adding that eight people were arrested, including a woman for allegedly racially abusing a Maracanã worker. CONMEBOL and the Argentine football federation didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s for comment. “The truth is that this group continues to achieve historic things, once again,” Messi told reporters after the match, per Reuters. “Obviously, at the beginning it was bad because we saw how they were beating people. “You think about the family, the people who are there, who don’t know what’s going on and we are more concerned about that than playing a match. At that point the match was secondary. “After that, winning this game like this I think is one of the most important wins that this group has achieved. It is something very nice to be able to win here in Brazil, after how strong they have been at home throughout their history.” In a further unexpected twist at the very end of the night, Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni placed doubt over his position as the national team head coach. “I need to think a lot about what I’m going to do,” Scaolini told reporters. “It’s not goodbye or anything else, but I need to think because the bar is very high. It’s complicated to continue. “It’s difficult to keep winning and these guys make it difficult. It’s time to think this time, I will tell the president, I will tell the players. This team needs a coach who has all the energy possible.” The win keeps Argentina top of World Cup qualifying, while Brazil is now languishing in sixth place and is now without a win in four matches under interim head coach Fernando Diniz, who recently led Fluminense to Copa Libertadores glory. There are 18 rounds in South America’s World Cup qualifying system, with the top six teams progressing to the 2026 event while the seventh-placed country will go into the FIFA play-off tournament, which will involve six countries from other continents.",Sports
US men’s soccer team shocked by Trinidad and Tobago but still makes Nations League semifinals," The US Men’s National Team suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago in the second leg of its CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal, but survived the upset to reach the semifinals 4-2 on aggregate. Fulham defender Antonee Robinson got the US men off to a flying start with a goal after 25 minutes, but the match was turned on its head when a moment of madness from Sergiño Dest resulted in the 23-year-old picking up two yellow cards in the space of 30 seconds. Dest, who assisted Robinson’s opening goal, picked up his first booking for deliberately kicking the ball into the stands in frustration at a refereeing decision. After being shown a yellow card, Dest continued to berate the referee and then blew kisses at him, resulting in an almost immediate second booking and a red card. After the match, Dest issued an apology on social media and called his actions “immature.” “I want to apologize to my teammates, staff, fans and whole nation for my behaviour,” he wrote on Instagram. “It was unacceptable, selfish and immature - I let my team down! It’s something I have to learn from and it won’t happen again.” US captain Tim Ream said he had “no explanation” for Dest’s reaction. “There’s not too many things that I can say here, publicly, that we said privately,” Ream told reporters after the game. “Overall, it’s a complete lack of respect for the guys that are playing, for the guys that are on the bench, a feeling of a lack of respect for the game itself and for the referees. “For me, it’s just a feeling of disrespect, to be completely honest with you, and that’s something he needs to understand because it completely changes the game, but then it completely changes any type of potential plan.” Head coach Gregg Berhalter also did not hold back in his assessment of Dest’s attitude on the pitch. “It is concerning because that’s not what we want to represent,” Berhalter told reporters, per Reuters. “As a team, players, the staff, we need to hold him accountable because it’s inexcusable. “It really is and we were very firm with our words after the game. He put a number of guys in jeopardy and made a number of guys do a lot of extra work in this weather and it’s inexcusable. “He’s a young player, he’s a fantastic part of this team. He’s going to learn, he’s going to grow. He made a dumb mistake and he knows that,” Berhalter added. With a numerical advantage, Trinidad and Tobago came from behind to win the match 2-1 thanks to goals from Reon Moore and Alvin Jones, but it wasn’t enough to reach the semifinals as the US had won the first leg in Texas, 3-0. This year’s CONCACAF Nations League also acts as the qualifiers for the expanded 2024 Copa América, which will take place in the United States. By reaching the last four, the US has secured its place in the competition, but Trinidad and Tobago will now play a single-elimination match to decide whether it will be one of the six CONCACAF teams participating.",Sports
"Tom Brady is not impressed with today’s NFL, says there’s ‘a lot of mediocrity’"," Tom Brady may have called time on his football career, but that hasn’t stopped him from keeping a close eye on the NFL this season. And the legendary quarterback isn’t particularly impressed with what he’s been seeing. Speaking on a recent episode of “The Stephen A. Smith Show,” seven-time Super Bowl winner Brady was in a damning mood as he lamented the current standard of play in the NFL. “I think there’s a lot of mediocrity in today’s NFL. I don’t see the excellence that I saw in the past,” he said. Asked why he felt that way, Brady added: “I think the coaching isn’t as good as it was. I don’t think the development of young players is as good as it was. I don’t think the schemes are as good as they were. “I think the rules have allowed a lot of bad habits to get into the actual performance of the game. So I just think the product, in my opinion, is less than what it’s been.” Brady, who retired from the NFL in February after a 23-year career with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, alluded to the increased scrutiny around roughing-the-passer – which is intended to protect quarterbacks from injury – and unnecessary roughness rules. He found himself at the center of this debate last year when he benefited from a controversial roughing-the-passer call as the Bucs held on to beat the Atlanta Falcons. “Guys are competitive. Guys play hard,” Brady said. “I look at a lot of [former] players like Ray Lewis and Rodney Harrison and Ronnie Lott and guys that impacted the game in a certain way and every hit they would have made would have been a penalty [today]. He added: “Offensive players need to protect themselves. It’s not up to a defensive player to protect an offensive player. “A defensive player needs to protect himself … I think a lot of the ways that the rules have come into play have allowed this – you can essentially play carefree and then if anyone hits you hard, there’s a penalty. And it’s very different than when I was playing.” The 46-year-old said that his teams used to work on the “fundamentals” of players not being tackled, but added that, in today’s game, “they’re trying to be regulated all the time.” Brady retired from the NFL with a record number of Super Bowl rings. He also won more games and passed for more yards and for more touchdowns than any other player in the history of the league. Denver Broncos safety Kareem Jackson, who was suspended by the NFL for four games – later reduced to two on appeal – in late October after multiple unnecessary roughness violations, posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, of Brady’s interview in apparent support of the NFL legend’s comments. Tuesday’s post came after Jackson was again handed a four-game suspension for repeated violations of player safety rules after a hit – which was not penalized during the game – on Minnesota Vikings quarterback Joshua Dobbs in Denver’s 21-20 win on Sunday night. The win was the safety’s first game back from his October suspension. Commenting on the latest suspension, which Jackson can appeal, NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan wrote in a letter to the Broncos safety: “You could have made contact with your opponent within the rules, yet you chose not to.” Former Super Bowl champion cornerback Richard Sherman, who defended Jackson after his previous suspension, responded to the new suspension and Brady’s comments, posting on X: “The product is suffering. Calling a player ‘dirty’ because he plays a physical brand of football that would have him on every highlight tape on every network when this game was great. Skewed the game so that players don’t have to be as skilled to be productive.”",Sports
‘Why did the VAR keep silent?’ Ukrainian media slams ‘scandalous’ decision in Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy," There have been a plethora of questionable calls made this season with the help of soccer’s Video Assistant Referee (VAR), but the decision not to award a penalty to Ukraine in the dying seconds of its crucial Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy on Tuesday is arguably one of the most controversial. With the score still 0-0 in the third minute of additional time, Italy midfielder Bryan Cristante seemingly tripped Mykhailo Mudryk inside the penalty area, but referee Jesús Gil Manzano, who had a clear view from just 10 yards away, didn’t give the foul. Stranger still, it appears as though VAR didn’t even review the challenge. CNN has reached out to European football’s governing body UEFA and the Ukraine football federation for comment. Ukraine needed to win to finish second in the group and qualify automatically for Euro 2024, but a draw was enough for Italy to go through as runners-up to England. The match finished 0-0, meaning Ukraine will now take part in the Euro playoffs in March next year. The mood in the Ukrainian media after the match was understandably one of frustration. Outlet UkrFootball called the decision a “scandalous situation.” Speaking to UkrFootball, Ukrainian former FIFA referee Miroslav Stupar said: “It seems that there was no VAR in this game. “I have one question: why did the VAR referee keep silent at the moment with Mudryk?” Stupar added. “The head referee saw this episode clearly, but was afraid to take responsibility and give a penalty. Even VAR did not go to watch [the foul]. “If he had watched it, he would definitely have given a penalty because there was contact. The referee didn’t want to expose himself. “If he had gone to watch VAR, it would have been a self-inflicted wound for him. But if he didn’t give a penalty, then he should have given Mudryk a yellow card for simulation.” Outlet TSN called it an “an erroneous decision.” “Not only the fans agreed that Ukraine had been ‘robbed’ but also the global media, which actively responded to the high-profile episode on social media.” Football24, another Ukrainian outlet wrote: “For some reason, the referee did not award a penalty, and VAR decided not to correct the referee’s mistake.”",Sports
Japan’s pitching sensation Yoshinobu Yamamoto is set to become MLB’s next star," Watch out baseball fans; Japan’s next big star looks to be on the move. Pitching sensation Yoshinobu Yamamoto is set to make a high-profile switch to Major League Baseball (MLB) during the offseason, after he was posted as a free agent by Japan’s Orix Buffaloes on Monday. The 25-year-old is expected to attract the attention of the league’s biggest franchises and could receive a highly-lucrative contract worth around $200m, per Reuters. A bidding war is expected to get underway on Tuesday and will run until January 4. Yamamoto has certainly impressed during the early part of his career, being awarded the Eiji Sawamura Award – given to the top starting pitcher in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) – on three occasions. He was 16-6 this last season with a 1.21 ERA; form that saw him win his third consecutive Triple Crown – in wins, ETA and strikeouts – in the NPB’s Pacific League. The right-hander, who boasts a fastball comfortably in the mid-to-high 90s, has enjoyed success on the international stage as well, helping his country win gold at the Tokyo Olympics, before clinching the World Baseball Classic in March. A free agent with his talent, at his age, is extremely rare in baseball. According to The Athletic, the New York Yankees, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox and the LA Dodgers are just some of the teams with a reported interest. Yamamoto is set to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui and current star Shohei Ohtani who have made the switch from Japan to the MLB.",Sports
Inflatable dome collapse delays Tiger Woods’ indoor golf venture by a year," Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy’s high-tech indoor golf venture, the TGL, has been delayed by a year after the inflatable dome of its custom-built Florida venue deflated, organizers announced Monday. The televised league featuring many of the PGA Tour’s top players had been set to tee off on January 9, but will now be postponed until early 2025 due to damages at SoFi Center, a 250,000 square foot arena at Palm Beach State College. Deflation was caused by “a failure of the temporary power system and backup systems used during construction” on November 14, damaging the air-supported dome section of the 1,600-capacity venue, the TGL said in a statement. No injuries were sustained and “most” of the technology was not impacted, it added. Organizers said the league’s 24 players, six team ownership groups and other key partners, including the PGA Tour, had been consulted ahead of the postponement. “This decision came after reviewing short-term solutions, potential construction timelines, player schedules, and the primetime sports television calendar,” the statement said. “We have begun to update plans and timelines and are confident that the extension will only improve our delivery.” The venture is the brainchild of TMRW Sports, a company co-founded by Woods and McIlroy. Both players are set to compete in the league, for Jupiter Links Golf Club and Boston Common Golf respectively. “I’ve been a believer in TGL, and as the momentum has built this past year, I’m even more excited about what this can become for fans of the game all around the world,” Woods, who is set to make his first competitive appearance since April later this month, said in a press release. “Although the events of last week will force us to make adjustments to our timelines, I’m fully confident that this concept will be brought to life by our great committed players.” McIlroy added: “The postponement brings mixed feelings of disappointment and excitement. Above all, we are happy that no one was injured. “We are looking forward to the launch of TGL. Given the circumstances, while the delay is disappointing, the postponement will allow us to regroup, refocus and return stronger.” First announced in August 2022, the TGL aims to attract a younger audience to golf. Six mic’d up teams – each formed of four PGA Tour stars – compete at the SoFi Center, playing on a 97 by 50 yard course area. Players shoot tee and approach shots into a 64 by 46 foot screen before moving to a “tech-infused” short game complex – the “Green Zone” – for shots within 50 yards of the hole. The “Green Zone” includes three virtual greens that can be mechanically altered via 189 actuators and jacks, allowing organizers to change the slope on each hole. Broadcast on ESPN, a 15-match regular season culminates in playoffs to crown the overall winner. Each team represents a different US city, state or town; Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Jupiter. The presence of McIlroy, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele, Matt Fitzpatrick, Max Homa and Wyndham Clark means six of the world’s current top-10 ranked men’s players are signed up. World No. 2 Jon Rahm had been included on the initial roster but withdrew earlier in November. “While I still think it’s a great opportunity, right now it would require a level of commitment that I can’t offer,” Rahm said in a November 2 post on X. “Best of luck to everyone (involved) and may the best team win!” Big names from across the sporting world feature in the six teams’ respective ownership groups. Los Angeles Golf Club’s leadership includes tennis sisters Serena and Venus Williams, two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry is involved with the San Francisco team, while Boston Common Golf is led by Fenway Sports Group, who own the MLB’s Boston Red Sox, the NHL’s Pittsburgh Penguins, NASCAR’s RFK Racing and English Premier League football club Liverpool.",Sports
Prince Harry drops the ceremonial puck during NHL game," Prince Harry and Meghan Markle watched on in Rogers Arena as the Vancouver Canucks defeated the San Jose Sharks on Monday. The Duke of Sussex also dropped the ceremonial puck ahead of the game, fist-bumping captains Quinn Hughes and Tomáš Hertl at center ice. “I actually had to tell him [to drop the puck] because he kept holding [it] and smiling,” Hertl told reporters after the game. “I said it’s time to drop it. It was a cool moment, for sure I will remember that one.” Prince Harry and Meghan are visiting Vancouver ahead of the 2025 Invictus Games, which will be held in British Columbia. The Invictus Games, founded by Prince Harry and first staged in 2014, is an international sporting event involving military personnel injured in service. Previous editions have been held in the UK, the US, Australia, Netherlands, and Germany, while Canada will host it for the second time. The Canucks won Monday’s game 3-1, improving to 13-5-1 on the season thanks to goals from Hughes, Sam Lafferty, and J.T. Miller. Hughes also recorded an assist to take his points tally for the season to a league-leading 30 – the third defenseman in NHL history to reach that milestone in fewer than 20 games. Prince Harry’s grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, also dropped the ceremonial puck during a game between the Canucks and the Sharks in 2002 – a trip to Canada that coincided with her Golden Jubilee celebrations.",Sports
"‘Mia, thanks for inspiring me’: After unimaginable personal tragedy, Camilo Villegas is a champion again"," For the briefest of moments, Camilo Villegas simply stood motionless, staring down at the hole and the ball that had just trickled into it. Then, accompanied by the deftest pump of his right fist, he turned his gaze skyward and whispered a message. “Mia, thanks for inspiring me.” Nine years and 8,496 holes since his last win on the PGA Tour, Villegas was a champion again, as a two-stroke victory at the Bermuda Championship earlier this month sealed a long-awaited return to the winner’s circle. The Colombian’s storied road back to the summit has much in common with countless players before him – injury, loss of form and a fight to cling onto his Tour status – but Villegas has also endured unimaginable personal tragedy. On July 26, 2020, Villegas and wife Maria’s 22-month-old daughter Mia died following a four-month battle with tumors on the brain and spine. “She was a very little kid, full of energy, and everything seemed to be going in the perfect direction,” Villegas told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell. “But trust me, life goes in circles and it takes sharp bends – things change.” In the weeks that followed, players, caddies and staff ventured out to tournaments sporting rainbow ribbons on their caps and shirts – a nod to Mia’s love of rainbows. Many would continue to wear the decoration for the duration of the season. Villegas had been considering quitting the sport before the loss of Mia. Having gone almost two years without a competitive appearance following a grueling right shoulder injury in 2018, the then four-time PGA Tour winner nicknamed “Spider-Man” for his unorthodox method of reading putts was contemplating hanging up his suit. Yet, less than one month later at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital Championship in Ohio, the World No. 1,015 was back in action – and even made the cut. “I’m telling you – 80% of the guys that play on the PGA Tour at some point have said, ‘I’m done with this and I’m going to quit,’” said Villegas. “That’s normal, you’re going to go through ups and downs … but when it comes to the Mia situation, it wasn’t because of that [that] I ever thought about quitting the game. “It actually kept the engine going, kept that motivation going to continue to grind.” It was a fitting tournament for Villegas to make his return at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital Championship. Mia had been treated at Miami’s Nicklaus Children’s Hospital, named after legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus and his wife Barbara following a $60 million pledge from their Children’s Health Care Foundation. Meanwhile, Villegas and Maria were driving charity efforts of their own, with the couple’s foundation remodeled as Mia’s Miracles. A rainbow crowning its logo, the foundation provides support to US and Colombian families navigating similar medical crises with young children. The foundation raised more than $750,000 in 2022, according to its website. “It opened our hearts,” Villegas reflected, “to help others, to bring smiles to those in need, even after losing our little one. “We were very fortunate to approach the experience the way we did; with support, with a great health insurance … and that’s not the case for most, so we wanted to give back. “It’s turned around a tragedy into something that can inspire others.” Slowly, but surely, momentum began to change for Villegas, “a little snowball” gathering speed and size. Mia’s Miracles was flourishing under Maria’s presidency, Villegas was back competing at PGA Tour events and then, in December 2021, the greatest boost yet. Their son Mateo was born at 7:56 a.m – a remarkable moment of synchronicity given Mia had been born at 7:56 p.m. Yet heading into the 2023 season, Villegas remained hovering outside the world’s top 600. Changes ensued – a new instructor, a new mental coach, “drastic” swing changes – and things finally clicked into gear in an unforgettable November. After finishing tied-runner up at the World Wide Technology Championship – his first PGA Tour top-10 finish in over two years – Villegas touched down in Bermuda the following week and lit up the Port Royal course. His 24-under overall finish saw him triumph by two shots ahead of Sweden’s Alex Noren to clinch $1.17 million in prize money, his 2024 PGA Tour card and a place at The Masters for the first time since 2015. Villegas’ trophy lift revealed the words tattooed on each wrist: ‘positive energy’ and ‘attitude.’ It is those two traits – and Mia – to which he attributes his success. “She is in a better place, trust me,” Villegas said. “I wish she was here, but the fact that she’s not, we’ve accepted that. She got a front row seat to send me energy and watch what happened in the last couple of weeks. “I know there’s a lot of people that have bumps and I want them to approach them with a good energy, a good attitude, to accept what’s happening and to turn it around – not to look back and regret what’s happened, but to look forward and see how they can change it, how they can make a terrible experience into something good because life keeps going no matter what.” Sweetening the triumph was the fact that Villegas sunk more birdies than any other player, securing him a $50,000 charity donation from sponsor RSM Classic as part of their “RSM Birdies for Love” campaign, run during seven PGA Tour events in the fall period. No surprises as to which foundation Villegas directed the donation towards. “Mia is here with us all the time and that will be the case forever,” Villegas said. “We’ve got a little angel up there looking at us and there’s a big connection. We’ll keep going, we’ll keep grinding, we’ll keep giving it our best, and Mia will be watching.”",Sports
"Philadelphia Eagles win Super Bowl rematch, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs, 21-17"," The Philadelphia Eagles avenged their Super Bowl LVII defeat on Monday night as they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 21-17, on the road at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri. While February’s championship game was a free-scoring offensive masterclass from both sides, Monday’s matchup was not the prettiest. The two teams combined for 13 punts while each squad’s quarterback threw an interception apiece. The Eagles were limited to 78 total net yards of offense in the first half, per the NFL, and 70 of those came on one touchdown drive. Star QB Jalen Hurts ended the game with only 150 yards, an interception and no passing touchdowns, but the Eagles still managed to escape with the ugly victory. “Whoever was going to win that game was going to do it gritty, grimy, nasty, all those adjectives,” Philadelphia head coach Nick Sirianni said after the game. “It was going to be that way, and the guys just stayed together and kept fighting, and kept grinding it out, and we were able to come out on top.” The Chiefs will come away from Monday’s game feeling incredibly frustrated, as the stat sheet suggested that they did enough to come away with the win. They outgained the Eagles by 98 yards, converted on 47% of their 3rd downs to Philly’s 27% and the offensive line allowed only one quarterback sack (on the first play of the game). Hurts, conversely, was brought down on five occasions. The Chiefs opened up the scoring towards the end of the first quarter. Reigning league MVP Patrick Mahomes found Justin Watson in the end zone before Eagles running back D’Andre Swift leveled things up on the next drive. The Super Bowl champions restored their advantage in the second through Travis Kelce, who caught his 74th career touchdown pass to move into joint-fifth place for most receiving TDs by a tight end. A Harrison Butker field goal to cap off the quarter meant that Kansas City entered halftime with a 10-point lead and appeared on course for another victory over Philadelphia. However, the tables turned after the break as the Eagles’ defense stepped up and shut out the Chiefs for the entirety of the second half. Hurts may not have had the most productive day through the air, but he was able to contribute on scoring plays on the ground. A rushing TD up the middle in the third quarter got the Eagles back into the game, and he was shoved across the goal line in the fourth as the Philadelphia executed its trademark ‘tush push.’ Hurts’ second rushing touchdown put the Eagles up four with just over six minutes to go and the Chiefs were still very much in the game, but were left to rue their mistakes as time expired. The Chiefs had already turned over the ball on their first fourth quarter drive via a Kelce fumble in the red zone, before the game literally slipped through their fingers on their final possession. Mahomes could only watch in despair as his perfect 50+ yard pass was dropped by wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling as he was across the goal line with under two minutes left in the game. The Eagles were able to get the defensive stop on fourth down to wrap up the win, meaning that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid tasted defeat against his former side for the first time. Philly is now a league-best 9-1 while Kansas City is 7-3 and has already lost as many games in Week 11 as it did in the entirety of the last regular season.",Sports
"Lewis Hamilton hits back at Las Vegas GP critics, saying the race ‘proved them wrong’"," After a bumpy start to the weekend, the Las Vegas Grand Prix eventually lived up to much of the pre-race hype. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, already crowned Formula One world champion, claimed his 18th victory of a remarkable season, but this race was a far cry from the dull, predictable procession the sport has often become over the past couple of seasons. There were multiple lead changes and countless overtakes throughout the field, with just 2.2 seconds separating the top three as they crossed the line. The weekend looked to be heading for disaster on Thursday when the first practice session was canceled after less than 10 minutes due to a loose drain cover. Prior to that, Verstappen had been a vocal critic of the event and its glitzy opening ceremony, calling the race “99% show, 1% sport.” Despite the early hiccup, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton was effusive in his praise of the grand prix, saying it was “so good” to race in. “I don’t know how it was as a spectacle for people to watch, but there was so much overtaking,” he told Sky Sports. “It was like Baku - but better. I really wasn’t expecting the track to be so great but the more and more laps you did I just really loved racing it. “Lots of great overtaking opportunities and I think for all those who were so negative about the weekend, saying it was all about show blah blah blah, I think Vegas proved them wrong.” Verstappen, eventually, enjoyed the spectacle too, singing Elvis Presley’s “Viva Las Vegas” in the cockpit and donning an Elvis race suit on the podium. F1 was returning to Las Vegas for the first time in more than 40 years, with the new street circuit featuring the city’s iconic Strip. Unsurprisingly, it was a star-studded event with a celebrity face at every turn. Brad Pitt, Rihanna, David Beckham, Shaquille O’Neal and Usain Bolt, among others, were all in attendance, with J Balvin, Kylie Minogue and Tiesto providing the musical entertaining throughout the weekend. Reaction to the weekend has been mixed, but there has still been plenty of positivity to come out of Vegas, with the BBC’s chief F1 writer Andrew Benson calling the grand prix a “thrilling spectacle.” “On one side is the Strip, with cars blasting past at 200mph, and the fake Eiffel Tower and Montgolfier balloon of the Paris hotel, the Venetian hotel nearby; on the other the vista of the Bellagio, its fountains, Caesars Palace and other venues,” Benson wrote. “A three-day ticket costs $11,247. But as a ‘wow’ moment – whether for ardent F1 fans, wider sports fans, or even those unversed in either – the view rivals even the Monaco harbour on the grand prix calendar.” Tom Cary, the Telegraph’s senior sports correspondent, said the “biggest positive … was the race itself.” “And there was certainly no shortage of action. Much more than anticipated.” However, Cary pointed to a litany of errors made over the course of the weekend that would likely leave a sour taste for some fans, if not the drivers. Ticket costs led to swathes of empty seats in the grandstands and on Thursday, after the drain cover debacle, fans were sent home by F1 in the middle of the night after watching less than 10 minutes of on-track action. F1 chief Stefano Domenicali and Las Vegas GP chief Renee Wilm issued a joint statement saying: “It happens, and we hope people will understand.” There have also been no refunds issued, with F1 instead only offering fans a $200 merchandise voucher, according to Reuters.",Sports
Dimitar Berbatov thinks Bulgarian soccer is in the grips of a ‘major crisis.’ He says he’s the man to fix it," Dimitar Berbatov’s successful soccer career took him to top-flight leagues in Germany, England, France, Greece and India, scoring more than 250 goals and winning 10 trophies. But his latest endeavor could be his biggest challenge to date. Four years after calling time on his playing career, Berbatov has grand ambitions of reshaping the football landscape in his native Bulgaria. He says that it’s neither status nor power that motivate him, rather a desire to impart his accumulated knowledge and experience from playing at the top of the sport in Europe. “Bulgarian football is in major crisis,” Berbatov tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies from London in a recent interview. “My team – Stiliyan Petrov, Martin Petrov, all former football players – decided that we need to change something back home. And we started to fight for that change.” But change has so far proved elusive, especially – the former Manchester United player says – while the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) and current president Borislav Mihaylov remain dogged by a series of controversies. Mihaylov resigned as president of the BFU in 2019 after England players said that they experienced racist abuse while playing against Bulgaria in Sofia; according to the union, Mihaylov’s resignation was a “consequence” of “an environment which is damaging to Bulgarian football.” Prior to the game between Bulgaria and England, Mihaylov had said that it was “offensive” and “derogatory” for England’s players and manager Gareth Southgate to suggest that they could face racist abuse. Then Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called for Mihaylov to resign after the match, saying that it was unacceptable for people from Bulgaria “to be associated with racism and xenophobia.” Mihaylov denied that Borissov’s remarks were linked to his resignation, according to The Guardian, saying at the time: “There were four or five people making the chants … We did what we had to do regarding the security during the game versus England. “Bulgaria is not a racist country. And my decision to step down has nothing to do with Prime Minister [Boyko] Borissov asking for my resignation the day after the game. My patience is over.” What happened in 2019 wasn’t the only racism scandal to tarnish the BFU’s leadership. Earlier this year, technical director Georgi Ivanov said that non-Bulgarian players of “other skin color” wouldn’t play for the national team during his time in the role. He later defended his comments following backlash, according to Balkan Insight. Two years after submitting his resignation, Mihaylov stood again and was re-elected as BFU president for a fifth term when Berbatov was also a candidate. However, Berbatov argues that Mihaylov won power unfairly. Prior to the election in 2021, the speaker of congress announced that a total of 242 votes were needed to win the BFU extraordinary congress, but Mihaylov went on to win just 241 votes and was subsequently certified by congress to be the winner. Berbatov then immediately told the media following the congress that he would be challenging the ruling and, soon after, launched a lawsuit in a Sofia court from which he is still awaiting a verdict. In the voting, 241 voted for Mihaylov, 230 for Berbatov, eight for a third candidate, and four did not vote. “I’ve been beaten in my professional career, scored goals, missed goals, lost battles,” Berbatov says. “When it was done the right way, you have nothing to say. But when it’s done the wrong way, you need to signal everyone to see what is going on.” The congress ultimately ruled after the voting that 241 votes was enough for victory, a decision that Berbatov’s court case seeks to challenge. “The Bulgarian law still recognizes the undisputed victory of Mr. Borislav Mihaylov as president in front of high-ranking FIFA and UEFA officials who also formally stated that the congress was of the highest organizational standards and its outcome should be respected in full,” the BFU told CNN Sport in a statement. It added: “The president and the governing body of the Bulgarian Football Union were rightfully elected and are recognized by all stakeholders as such – and the fact that Mr. Berbatov continues to proclaim himself presidential candidate is absurd considering that there are no presidential elections scheduled.” Mihaylov, a former goalkeeper who captained Bulgaria to the semifinals of the 1994 World Cup, has been president of the country’s football union since 2005, barring the two-year hiatus after he resigned from the role. However, there is a growing sense of discontent over Mihaylov’s leadership among soccer fans in Bulgaria, and that came to a head on Thursday when supporters clashed with police during Bulgaria’s European Championship qualifying match against Hungary in Sofia. The protests were against the BFU’s executive board amid a poor run of results from the men’s national team. Some of those attending the protests held signs and wore t-shirts denouncing Mihaylov’s leadership. There had already been controversy surrounding Thursday’s game after it was moved from Sofia to Plovdiv then back to the Bulgarian capital with days’ notice. The switch was reportedly due to construction work at Plovdiv’s Hristo Botev Stadium. The initial change of venue had been requested because of a security risk regarding fan protests; the game was eventually played behind closed doors due to “an elevated risk of public disorder,” UEFA said. The Hungarian Football Federation voiced frustration at the game being relocated at such short notice and fans being unable to attend, describing the decision as “unprecedented, completely unjustified, and severely unsportsmanlike.” Its statement added: “It is not even possible to organize a family holiday in this way, let alone an international football match with a huge stake that affects many people and millions are interested in.” The game ended 2-2 as Bulgaria remains bottom of its European qualifying group having failed to win any of its seven games. “It’s obvious that the system is not working because, since 2005 until the present day, we have failed to qualify for any major tournament as a nation,” says Berbatov. “And that shows you how football back home is ruled. When the national team is the face of the federation and when the national team has no major tournaments to go and play, it’s signaling that football back home is not governed the right way.” Bulgaria last qualified for a major international tournament at Euro 2004, when a squad featuring Berbatov lost all three of its games. The nation hasn’t appeared at the World Cup since 1998. Berbatov is arguably Bulgarian soccer’s most famous export since the turn of the century, best known for his skillful ball control and strong scoring record at top clubs across Europe. He is also a hugely popular figure with fans, particularly in Bulgaria, and says that his vision for the sport is “completely different” compared with those currently governing the federation in his home country. He has been living and working in Bulgaria since retiring from soccer. “Football is suffering and no major talent can go out and play in big leagues,” Berbatov says. “There is no infrastructure back home, no stadiums. The kids are training in poor conditions.” The BFU acknowledged that most stadiums in Bulgaria, while being renovated, are in “poor condition,” but told CNN that this is a consequence of neglect from club owners and the government’s “lack of involvement” in the sport. Berbatov says that he and his team have toured the country three times, presenting their vision of how they would govern the sport to the clubs in Bulgaria. “We are frozen in time,” he adds. “We are still in ‘94. And we think this is how things should be done. No, it’s 2023. Things are completely different in football and this is what I want to show the people back home.” As he awaits a decision from the court regarding the 2021 congress, Berbatov is also pressing soccer’s authorities to investigate the circumstances under which Mihaylov was able to win the election. He says that Aleksander Čeferin, the president of European soccer governing body UEFA, was “very concerned” about the situation when the pair spoke in the past, while world governing body FIFA, he says, is yet to answer his team’s requests. CNN Sport asked UEFA about Berbatov’s apparent conversation with Čeferin but did not receive a response. “Isn’t it the job of FIFA and UEFA as governing bodies to constantly be everywhere in the federations and see the red flags and work to be sure – not to act after the incident – but prevent incidents like this happening?” says Berbatov. FIFA did not respond to CNN Sport’s request for comment, but in a statement, UEFA said that it has “never expressed any concern regarding the election process in BFU.” It added: “We can confirm that UEFA has received a file containing numerous documents pertaining to the matter from Mr Berbatov. Our administration has thoroughly examined these documents but has not found anything suspicious or untoward. “Finally, there is an ongoing legal case before the national court involving two candidates. UEFA will monitor the case’s progress and be attentive to the outcome.” Berbatov says that he remains committed to his task, confident that he is the man to bring positive change to Bulgarian soccer. “We will succeed, there is no doubting that,” he adds. “It’s going to take a while and it’s taken now two years of back and forth, back and forth. “This is not the thing that I love to do, but that I am forced to do. Hopefully, FIFA and UEFA, they will wake up and try to investigate.”",Sports
These twin brothers made history before even stepping foot on an NBA court," You would be forgiven for referring to the 2023 NBA rookie cohort as the “Victor Wembanyama draft class.” After all, the 7-foot-4-inches teenager is the most hyped prospect since LeBron James. He is a walking cheat code who is unlike anything basketball has ever seen before, with 2014 MVP Kevin Durant among those already singing the Frenchman’s praises this season. However, “Wembymania” is not the only unprecedented narrative from this draft. Amen and Ausar Thompson have their own story to tell. Though multiple pairs of twins have played together in the NBA, the Thompson brothers became the first siblings to be drafted in the top five of the same draft. They were even drafted back-to-back. Amen was selected fourth overall by the Houston Rockets, while Ausar came off the board at No. 5 to the Detroit Pistons. “We really haven’t seen a pair of brothers like this in a long time, maybe ever in the NBA,” Kelly Iko, an NBA and Houston Rockets writer for The Athletic, told CNN Sport. “It just seems like everything they do translates to winning basketball. Crashing the glass, if it’s helping on defense, rotating, communication, ball movement, facilitation, just trying to find guys and get to great spots.” The twins had an unorthodox path to the league. After deciding to forgo their last year of high school and renounce their college eligibility, they signed with Overtime Elite (OTE), a startup basketball league for 16 to 20-year-olds based in Atlanta. They spent two seasons in OTE, playing on separate teams in their first year before Amen joined his brother on the City Reapers, where they were coached by Dave Leitao. He describes the twins as having “insatiable” work ethics and says they are “very humble, tremendous people.” “This is my 40th year in basketball, so I think I’ve been around some pretty special individuals,” Leitao said to CNN Sport. “Amen and Ausar, two or three times a week, would do something that I’ve never seen before. “I’ve been caught on camera saying: ‘I’ve never seen that before, like, did you just see what I saw?!’” Amen and Ausar were born on January 30, 2003, in Oakland, California, with Amen being the older twin by a solitary minute. They share the middle name XLNC (pronounced “excellence”), which was given to them to convey a sense of power and greatness, according to their father Troy, who is also their agent. The brothers have often spoken about how inseparable they are, and told the New York Times earlier this year that they had never spent more than two days apart. Making it to the NBA had always been a shared dream – the twins created a vision board when they were nine years old, with one of the central goals being to “become the greatest NBA player of all time.” They played high school basketball together at Pine Crest School after moving to Florida and were both five-star recruits after graduating. They were still very much a duo at OTE (even though they played on different teams during their first year) and are each other’s biggest fan. However, life in the league means that they now often find themselves on opposite sides of the country, something that the twins made sure to prepare for. “They were adamant about understanding that they were going to have to separate,” Leitao said. “Now that they’re apart, they talk every day.” The college path has long been the traditional way of making it to the league for American basketball players. Nationally televised games, the allure of the NCAA tournament and a plethora of NBA scouts watching you are all part of the appeal. However, in recent years, we have seen aspiring hoopers choose alternative routes, such as overseas competitions and the developmental G League, to the NBA. It is not that the Dukes, UCLAs and North Carolinas of the world are losing their shine – March Madness will always be March Madness – more so that the next generation is increasingly exploring opportunities off the beaten track. Overtime Elite was launched in 2021 as another option for young players. It is operated by Overtime, a media company aimed at Gen Z sports fans. Players receive a minimum $100,000 wage (which they can waive if they wish to retain college eligibility) and access to state-of-the-art training facilities in the 103,000 square-foot OTE Arena in Atlanta. They also get an education that includes “applicable professional skills training” classes, which focuses on topics such as financial literacy, media training and mental wellbeing. Amen and Ausar became the highest profile players to sign up for the league’s inaugural season back in 2021. They skipped their final year of high school and sacrificed college eligibility after agreeing to be paid a salary. It was a huge gamble to take: OTE had not yet been established as a viable option for young players, yet here were two highly-rated prospects blazing a trail and taking a risk. It paid off in a big way for the twins, who dominated the league as high-jumping, shot-swatting, consistently viral, highlight machines that moved at an electric pace and stifled offenses on the defensive end. Their draft positions were also a huge boost for OTE, which saw two of its prospects selected in the top five after only its second season. “It’s a really big vote of confidence for OTE,” said Omari Sankofa II of the Detroit Free Press to CNN Sport. “[The coaches] talked about how they wanted to come in and really give athletes a modern platform to improve their skills and translate to the pros pretty quickly.” Leitao agrees that it helped to launch the twins’ careers, saying: “Whether they wanted to be, or we wanted them to be, they’ve become the face of Overtime Elite. It’s great for the growth of basketball, knowing that there’s not just one avenue to take to get to your dream.” Amen and Ausar are so frequently referred to as “the Thompson twins” that it is almost as if they are one unit. They are identical: both are 6 foot 7 inches tall and both possess otherworldly athletic ability. “If you’re not careful, you’re looking at the same person!” Leitao said. On the court is where they begin to diverge. “Although they have come up together their entire lives, they still have differences,” said Iko. “Amen is more of a primary ball handler, whereas Ausar is more of a point forward type role.” Amen, who plays the point guard position, recently suffered an ankle injury but showed flashes – both in preseason and in his brief first string of NBA games off the bench – of what he can provide for a team. Iko has been impressed by the “poise” he has shown. “His vision is through the roof,” he said. “The biggest thing that’s caught my attention is how quickly he moves the ball and how much he encourages unselfish team play.” His athleticism almost goes without saying at this point. “We’re talking about one of the top 10 most explosive players in the league by age 21,” Iko continued. Ausar, meanwhile, has started every regular season game at small forward for the Pistons and his rebounding and suffocating defensive ability (not typically a characteristic associated with rookies) have caught the eye. “It just seems like defensively, everything just moves really slow for him,” said Sankofa. “He has really good anticipation as far as knowing where the ball will be, where he needs to be, forcing steals. “Sometimes, it just seems like he knew what’s going to happen before it happened.” Ausar has had some flashy highlight plays on the offensive end, which have helped contribute to his side being dubbed the “Showtime Pistons” – a far cry from the notoriously physical “Bad Boys” of the ‘90s. Iko compares Amen to Deron Williams and Lamar Odom, while Sankofa sees shades of Scottie Pippen in Ausar (a “lofty comparison,” he admitted). Both see natural similarities between the twins and former NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala. Though the Thompsons excel in a multitude of areas, it is almost universally agreed that they need to work on their outside shooting. Ausar has been left wide open behind the three-point line by defenses so far, and he is not making the opposition pay. “That cramps the court for everybody else when defenses are able to pack in the way that they’ve been doing against the Pistons so far,” Sankofa says. Amen also struggles in this aspect, with Iko explaining that the Rockets rookie had been working with lead assistant and shooting guru Ben Sullivan to improve his jump shot mechanics. Fortunately, the twins have their whole careers ahead of them to iron out their flaws and are as determined as anyone to become the best players they can possibly be. “They can’t function unless they’re in the gym working on their game,” said Leitao, who appears immensely proud of the brothers. “I’m aware that you have to check certain boxes sometimes, especially in the NBA with all the money and all the things socially or humanistic that get in the way, but they’re as equipped as anybody to handle that and more when it comes to their growth and development. “They’re well on their way to becoming special.”",Sports
Ice hockey players have been ‘stubborn’ about wearing neck protection. That might be about to change," A “crazy amount of emotions” ran through TJ Oshie’s mind as he watched footage of what would be American hockey player Adam Johnson’s final moments on the ice. After keeping Johnson and the 29-year-old’s family in his thoughts, Oshie – a winger with the NHL’s Washington Capitals and co-founder of a hockey apparel company – said that his focus turned to how often he overlooks his own sense of self-preservation while competing at the top of the sport. “Sometimes, you feel like you’re invincible on the ice,” the 36-year-old tells CNN Sport. “I tend to go at things head-first – slide in and worry about my injuries later.” Days after Johnson’s death, which was described by his team as a “freak accident,” Oshie opted to wear an undershirt his company developed with a built-in protective guard around his neck for the Capitals’ game against the New York Islanders on November 2. His decision came at a time when there is much discussion within the hockey community about neck guards, particularly given the circumstances around Johnson’s death in the UK. A Sheffield coroner’s report found that the Nottingham Panthers player “sustained an incised wound to the neck caused by the skate of another player” and later died in hospital as a result of the injury. The Panthers had been playing the Sheffield Steelers on October 28 when Johnson was involved in a collision with an opposition player. Spectators were asked to leave the Utilita Arena in Sheffield and the match was immediately suspended. “I thought about my kids,” Oshie says about wearing a neck guard as he reflects on Johnson’s death. “I’m getting towards the end of my career, and I just wanted to take that extra step to protect myself and protect their dad’s future.” Several of his Capitals teammates have also been wearing cut-resistant neck guards in recent weeks, Oshie says, while some organizations have moved to mandate neck protection. The English Ice Hockey Association has announced that all players must wear neck guards from the start of next year, and the Pittsburgh Penguins, Johnson’s former NHL team, are mandating neck guards for their minor league players, coach Mike Sullivan has said. Sheffield coroner Tanyka Rawden said in her report that she is “sufficiently concerned that deaths may occur in the future” if neck guards are not worn, adding that her inquest will determine whether neck protection could have prevented Johnson’s death. In the NHL, neck guards – let alone neck coverings of any kind – are not a common sight. “I think there is a machismo within ice hockey where you’re seen as being something less if you choose to wear more protective equipment,” ice hockey broadcaster Seth Bennett tells CNN Sport. “A lot of players would think that wearing a neck guard is more to do with getting a puck in the neck and trying to protect your larynx as much as a skate blade … There isn’t a thought process that this is something that is a vital piece of equipment.” In the UK, where he also coaches youth ice hockey, Bennett says that he has seen senior players wear neck guards only when it satisfies an insurance requirement. He also believes that the sport and its players should do more to prioritize safety on the ice. “It’s horrific that somebody died,” says Bennett. “It would be even worse if the sport stood with its fingers in its ears and its eyes closed.” Currently, the International Ice Hockey Federation only mandates neck guards for junior players and recommends that all other players wear them on the ice, but it’s down to individual leagues and governing bodies to decide whether to make them compulsory in the games they oversee. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman told reporters earlier this month that introducing neck guards either through a mandate or on a “phased-in basis” is something that the league will discuss with the players’ association. He added that players have the right to make some decisions themselves. USA Hockey, meanwhile, recommends that all players wear a guard which “covers as much of the neck area as possible,” noting that this sort of protection does not “eliminate the risk” of a laceration. “I will say that hockey players are stubborn historically, and a lot of guys probably won’t try it or won’t wear it,” says 2018 Stanley Cup champion Oshie. “But I think you will see a lot more guys at least giving it a go on a practice or trying it on off the ice.” Oshie – whose NHL career has so far spanned 16 seasons and nearly 1,000 games – founded his own hockey apparel company, Warroad, in 2018, and he has recently been sporting the brand’s neck guard at practices and during games. Warroad’s neck guards are fitted with Kevlar and steel components, ensuring that they have enough stiffness to stay upright and offer effective coverage around the neck. There has been huge demand for the company’s neck and wrist guards in recent weeks as professional and amateur players alike seek out more protective gear, according to Jason Olden, a Warroad co-founder. “We built about 2,800 units,” Olden tells CNN Sport. “In about a 12-hour period, we’ve moved through all of our inventory of the neck and wrist product.” He added: “Ultimately, it’s a bit of a frenzy from a supply chain standpoint because, now, we want to get as many players protected as quickly as we can, and we’re going to have constant rolling production for the foreseeable future.” Other brands have also restated their commitment to player safety after Johnson’s death. “This is lifesaving technology,” Mary-Kay Messier, VP of global marketing for Bauer Hockey, tells CNN Sport. “And there are products in the market that work and we’re seeing them being adopted now. I think we need to continue to develop products [and] continue to make them more comfortable to ensure player adoption.” Bauer Hockey has also seen the demand for neck guards grow in the wake of Johnson’s death. “What we have seen is a huge demand from retailers ramping up for consumer demand,” says Messier. “We have taken every channel that we can to ensure the availability, including airfreighting product over to meet the demand and ramping up production.” The infrequency with which neck laceration injuries occur in hockey, alongside feeling that guards are ineffective or uncomfortable, are some of the reasons that players aren’t consistently wearing protection around the throat. Despite being a rare occurrence in hockey, there is a history of serious neck-cut injuries happening in the sport. Last year, high school hockey player Teddy Balkind died after another player’s skate cut his neck, while Florida Panthers forward Richard Zednik needed emergency surgery after sustaining a neck slash against the Buffalo Sabres in 2008. That last incident triggered debilitating PTSD for former NHL goaltender Clint Malarchuk, who almost died from a cut to the neck following an on-ice collision in 1989. “It’s big, big anxiety,” Malarchuk told The Athletic after learning about Johnson’s death, adding that he now has the “tools” to deal with the lingering mental anguish from his own neck laceration. The circumstances around Johnson’s death, like other similar occurrences in the sport, have only strengthened calls for neck guards to be worn more widely. “I view these tragedies as an impetus for change,” Dr. Mike Stuart, chief medical officer at USA Hockey and chair of its Safety and Protective Equipment Committee, tells CNN Sport. “There’s a real heightened awareness now that these lacerations can occur to the body. And there’s already been, I think, some real renewed interest, if you will, where leagues are starting to mandate and players and parents are ordering cut resistance products at a record pace.” Stuart believes that more work needs to be done to improve the overall quality of neck guards, some of which he thinks are too thin, not wide enough, prone to sliding down the neck and/or liable to shrinking in the wash. “The protective device should literally go from the ear down to the collarbone because it needs to protect the area underneath the angle of the mandible (the lower jaw) and the area right above the collarbone where there’s also neurovascular structures,” he says. One way to make neck guards and other protective equipment more widely worn would be to introduce mandates for players of a certain age, which is similar to how helmets became compulsory in the NHL. At the time, a mandate was introduced for players who signed professional contracts after June 1, 1979, to wear a helmet, taking the element of choice away from the players. “I have experienced player reluctance to wear protective equipment with everything we’ve tried to do in the area of safety,” says Stuart, “and that has to do even with facial protection and with other types of protective equipment. “There is still freedom of choice in the National Hockey League and there are players that warm up before games without helmets; there used to be players who wear no facial protection and there are current players who wear visors totally ineffectively.” However, Stuart says that he remains “very optimistic” that, with education, player attitudes towards safety can evolve over time and protective equipment like neck guards can become more widely worn. Oshie says that those shifts in attitude toward safety are ongoing. “We are hesitant to maybe get away from the old ways a little bit more,” says Oshie, “and I don’t know if that’s because we watched the guys before us, we looked up to the players who were veterans when we came in as rookies. “But it does look like, especially as the kids are growing up and the game gets younger and younger, that they are willing to adapt a little bit more than maybe the generations before them.”",Sports
A doping free-for-all Enhanced Games calls itself the answer to doping in sports. Opponents say it poses a danger to health," The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.” Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.” CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.” Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.” Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.” WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.” WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.” The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.” “Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. “In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. “The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.” Editor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article. Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.” He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.” Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. “If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport. “They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. “I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.” The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.” “The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. “Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. “It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.” Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.” The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.” D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.” “I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza. “They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.” According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.” Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.” When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. “It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.” By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. “Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.” Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.” When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.” Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss. Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.” Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.” Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.” UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.” UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.” Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was. He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. “I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.” When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.” He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.” “This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.” D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. “We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. “Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.” Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.” He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?” WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a Working Group on Doping Prevalence in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.",Sports
"From breaking records to LeBron James shoutouts, meet Puka Nacua, the ‘special’ rookie wide receiver"," In Canton, Ohio, between the busts of the legendary figures of the sport – from Super Bowl winning quarterbacks to era-defining coaches – stands a blue and gold jersey with the No. 17 on the back. The name on the back might be unfamiliar to many, but even after just a few games in the NFL, Puka Nacua has already earned his spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Nacua’s jersey has been placed in football’s shrine to all things great and good because of the historic beginning to his rookie NFL season. Drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the fifth round of this year’s draft to relatively little fanfare, Nacua is exceeding expectations with a series of explosive performances. Following Week 5 of the 2023 season – a game in which he caught seven passes for 71 yards and a touchdown – the 22-year-old’s jersey was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the numerous records he had broken. The headline was that he had recorded the most receptions (46) and receiving yards (572) by a rookie in their first five games. At his current pace, Nacua will obliterate the receiving record set by a first-year player in the NFL, set by Jaylen Waddle just a few years ago, as the Rams wide receiver seemingly every week sets a new milestone for the most receptions by a player in their first year as a professional. And for this unheralded player from Utah, it makes the achievement that much more special. Football has always been around Nacua. He has three older brothers, all of whom played at Brigham Young University (BYU) at some point. So when it came to transferring to his hometown university after a few disappointing years at the University of Washington – battling a broken foot and limited playing time from the bench – it was a no-brainer for Nacua. Fesi Sitake, the wide receiver coach and passing game coordinator at BYU, vividly remembers the first time he encountered Nacua. “I remember the first game I watched of him in high school. I saw him make one of the best catches he’s had in his high school career and he’s had a lot of them,” Sitake told CNN Sport. “‘Holy cow, this guy’s special.’ And as we developed the relationship in recruiting, I could tell that what you saw on the surface is who he really was, which was just a super happy, delightful, appreciating life, loves football, great personality type of young man.” Once Nacau had returned home to Utah, Sitake remembers his dedication to learning and improving at BYU, explaining how he was naturally extremely intelligent at his position and also physically gifted, while remaining a warm person too. Sitake describes Nacua’s physical gifts as being like a “gazelle on one play and a Clydesdale the next play” – a Clydesdale is a powerful breed of horse originating in Scotland where it was predominately used for agricultural means. Paired with quarterback Jaren Hall – also drafted in the fifth round of this year’s draft to the Minnesota Vikings – Nacua blossomed into a dynamic offensive weapon, his physical traits making him stand out while his catching ability developed. In the 21 games he played at BYU, Nacua caught 91 passes for 1,430 yards and 11 touchdowns, including finishing seven games with more than 100 receiving yards. He led the Cougars in both statistics in his two years at the university, despite dealing with injuries at the end of his final year. More than his ability to pile up statistics was Nacau’s uncanny skill at coming up with the big catches at the biggest moments. Sitake highlights BYU’s clash with Boise State last year as a moment which encapsulates Nacua’s abilities as a player and a person. BYU trailed with under a minute remaining, but Nacua was able to make a game-winning, acrobatic catch. Not only did it clinch the victory, it also helped end a four-game losing streak which Sitake described as being like a “little dark cloud that was over our program.” “To feel the electricity on a sideline, to see the relief on our sideline, get the monkey off our backs, so to speak, to see Puka just elated. And it wasn’t for himself because he knew how much we wanted it, how much we were going through it as a team,” Sitake remembers. “I just remember putting my arm around him and just having a great talk with him and saying: ‘That’s who you are, man. Like, when someone needs something, they go to you. And this is just going to be a small sample right here of how your life is going to be.’ “And then we end up finishing the season with four straight wins, and Puka was the catalyst to that … through the dark four-game stretch, he was just putting his head down. “He was still smiling, he was still laughing, was still working hard. He never changed according to the environment around him and it ended up paying off.” The 177th overall pick in the NFL draft isn’t usually followed with much interest, given it comes midway through the third day of proceedings. But when the Rams submitted their selection with the final pick of the fifth round, little did they know that they’d completely revamped their receiving corps with just one selection. An already high-ceiling group, which included Cooper Kupp – the NFL’s receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns leader in 2021 – was searching for additional explosiveness. Last season, Kupp had suffered a catastrophic knee injury and the drop off between him and the rest of the receiving group was stark as the Rams endured a tough Super Bowl title defense, going from 12-5 in 2021 to 5-12 in 2022. In Nacua, they got a contributor from day one. He might have fallen down in teams’ draft predictions due to his injury history in college, but the Rams decided to take a risk and add him to the squad. In fact, the official NFL scouting report on Nacua coming out of BYU predicted he would be taken in the sixth or seventh round of the draft, also saying that he is “lacking the twitch or speed to attack NFL man coverage at a successful rate.” The scouting report also said he would “struggle to elude NFL press coverage” and “lacks instant acceleration to separate” from defensive players. Sitake recalls texting Nacua after finding out his new home, with the two expressing their excitement at Nacua being able to be coached by Sean McVay and paired up with Kupp. Sitake had played alongside and coached Kupp during his time at Eastern Washington. With Kupp out for the first four weeks of the season, Nacua flourished in the limelight, totaling 25 receptions and 266 receiving yards through the first two weeks of the season. “It was a dream come true. It couldn’t be any better,” Nacau told reporters after the Rams’ Week 1 victory in Seattle against the Seahawks. “I had a ton of fun out there.” In those two weeks alone, Nacua broke three NFL rookie records – his 25 receptions broke the previous record of receptions by a rookie through their first two games of 19 set by Earl Cooper in 1980; 25 receptions were also the highest ever for a rookie in any two-week span, surpassing Odell Beckham Jr.’s record of 23 in 2014. Nacua also became the first rookie in history to record 10-plus catches and 100-plus receiving yards in each of his first two games. Rams head coach McVay has seen his fair share of efficient offenses. He might only be 37, but McVay has been credited in part with bringing about an offensive revolution to the league after his appointment to his current role in 2017. So when McVay effusively praises a player, it’s probably worth sitting up and listening. “He’s a stud. The game makes sense to him, physically and mentally tough,” McVay said after the Rams’ Week 2 loss to the San Francisco 49ers when asked about Nacua. “Works really hard. “I think even when you guys talked to him last week, he’s very inquisitive. He asked a lot of questions and he’s got great guys to be able to lean on, whether that’s (Rams receivers coach) Eric Yarber, but really, you know, you look at the veterans in that receiver room with Cooper (Kupp), I think Tutu’s (Atwell) done an excellent job. “And Van (Jefferson), his rapport with Matthew (Stafford) where they’re able to bounce things off of one another, I think that’s been a real positive and Puka is going to continue to improve and I love Puka.” But Nacua had only just gotten started. A further 72 yards came in Week 3 before a monster nine-catch, 163-yard performance against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 4 where Nacua scored his first NFL touchdown – which just so happened to be the overtime game-winner for the Rams. A clip of Nacua’s girlfriend, Hallie Aiono, celebrating the moment – sitting almost disbelievingly as tears roll down her face – was shared by the official NFL Instagram account and had over 266,000 likes, showing the growing interest in the Rams rookie. Praise for Nacua reached its zenith that week when arguably the best basketball player of all time, LeBron James, shouted out his performances, calling him ‘Puka Dončić’ – a reference to the Dallas Mavericks superstar guard, who is prone to creating magic on the court – on a live stream on social media. Week 5 marked the return of Kupp which saw the majority of targets go the way of the 30-year-old star. But that hasn’t stop Nacua from racking up monster statistics. Over the next five weeks of the season, Nacua compiled 326 receiving yards off 25 catches and a touchdown. As a rookie, he sits in the top five in the NFL in terms of receiving yards (827), as well as touting 64 catches to his name, breaking Kupp’s previous single-season franchise record of 62 set back in 2017. Nacua has 293 more receiving yards than the next rookie in the league, Jordan Addison. Nacua has given the Rams’ receiving corps one of the most-feared duos around and his poise defies someone playing his first year in the NFL. “There’s always naturally going to be an element of surprise, not in the way that you didn’t think he could be successful, but that he’s on the track at such an early age,” Sitake told CNN. “And I think that’s just a credit to a lot of factors: the right fit, the organization, Puka himself, the work he’s put in, his supporting cast around him, his family and friends and the people that love him. “It’s just created this perfect recipe to have the season he’s having right now. Whatever that results in terms of records broken or not, man, I’m just so happy for him, and I truly believe no one’s more deserving to be on the track that they’re on right now than Puka.”",Sports
Super shoes have ‘blown distance running into a new stratosphere.’ Are they benefitting the sport?," Perhaps the most intense rivalry in distance running currently isn’t between two of the world’s top athletes, although it is being played out at major marathon races across the globe. When Ethiopian Tigst Assefa crossed the finish line of the Berlin Marathon six weeks ago in an astonishing two hours, 11 minutes, and 53 seconds – eviscerating the previous best time by more than two minutes – the bounds of possibility in women’s running over 26.2 miles were suddenly being adjusted. It was a ground-breaking victory not only for the Assefa, but also for Adidas – the company responsible for the sleek, platformed shoes on her feet. “Tigist Assefa … we are so proud of you!” CEO Bjørn Gulden later posted on Instagram. Fast-forward two weeks, however, and a rival brand was also toasting a world record. Enter Kelvin Kiptum, a 23-year-old Kenyan sporting orange and red-tinted Nikes laced over bright pink socks at the Chicago Marathon. Kiptum, in just his third ever marathon, finished in a time of two hours and 35 seconds – 34 seconds faster than the old world record held by compatriot Eliud Kipchoge, who is widely considered to be the greatest distance runner of all time. The two records in quick succession heightened the debate about how carbon-plated shoes – commonly referred to as “super shoes” – are rapidly changing the distance-running landscape. Today, they are worn by virtually all elite marathon runners, both for racing and for training, and by many casual runners, too. Some are happy about the new technology, arguing that an influx of world records and fast times only serves to advance the sport; others, like long-time coach Peter Thompson, believe that they are an obfuscation, skewing performance and removing a sense of “natural progression” in distance running. “The brands are not motivated by what’s best for the sport,” Thompson told CNN. “The brands are motivated by what’s best for them, and it then becomes a brand warfare rather than competition between individuals … who’s got the best materials, who’s got the best architecture. “At the moment,” he added, “it’s become shoe wars.” Thompson, who has previously helped the likes of Nike, Reebok, and Hoka to design running shoes and track spikes, refers to the stiff, curved plates in modern running footwear as “external recoil devices” which provide “even greater propulsion.” Those plates are embedded within thick, lightweight foam soles of no more than 40 millimeters in height, according to guidelines set by governing body World Athletics, and sit below very thin, minimalist uppers. Take Adidas’ Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1, which hadn’t been worn in a race prior to Assefa’s world record and went on general sale for $500 around the same time. They weigh just 138 grams, have a 39-millimeter-thick heel, and provide the wearer with “greater energy return” by improving running economy, Adidas claims. Assefa attributed her world record to “hard work over the past year,” but prior to the race had hailed her shoes as “the lightest racing shoe I have ever worn.” “Running in them is an incredible experience – like nothing I’ve felt before,” she said. Adidas told CNN that 521 pairs of the shoe were released to coincide with the Berlin Marathon and “sold out in a matter of minutes.” Another drop is set for November. Designed only to be worn for a single marathon race plus familiarization time, the exact longevity of the shoes will depend “on the athlete wearing them and the conditions they are worn in,” Adidas said. Their relatively short shelf life has courted controversy: environmental group The Green Runners said that the shoe fosters “an acceptance that increased shoe consumption is fine,” though Adidas rejected the notion that it is a single-use product. “What we can say about these shoes is that they are designed for performance rather than durability,” Thomas Allen, a sports engineer at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, told CNN. “Whenever you design anything, you’re making compromises in different areas. And I guess in this particular example, it’s like a Formula One car – they’re optimizing to go as fast as possible. They’re not necessarily optimizing for durability.” Nike, meanwhile, has been a pacesetter in the running shoes arms race ever since its Zoom Vaporfly model was worn by three athletes, including Kipchoge, in the men’s marathon at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The company’s latest offering – the Alphafly 3, worn by Kiptum and women’s champion Sifan Hassan in Chicago – has been called “the fastest marathon shoe in the world” by Nike. Shortly after Kiptum’s record, it was announced that it would be going on general sale in January 2024. Asked to comment on this story, Nike told CNN: “We’ve proven in our labs that Nike racing shoes provide measurable benefits, but it’s the athletes on the roads who validate our work. “The athlete will always be our focus and we will continue to deliver ground-breaking innovations for elite athletes and everyday runners alike.” It would be hard to argue that super shoes haven’t made the world’s fastest marathon runners even faster. On the men’s all-time list, 15 of the 20 best times in history have come since 2018, the year before a pair of Nike super shoes helped Kipchoge to run the first unofficial sub-two-hour marathon under contrived conditions. On the women’s side, 17 of the 20 fastest times have come since 2018. “I love seeing great athletes performing in wonderful ways,” Tim Hutchings, a former distance runner who represented Great Britain at the 1984 Olympics, told CNN, “but there is this undercurrent of disbelief at what they are achieving because all historical context has been lost with the incoming of this generation of footwear. “These aren’t really records at all,” Hutchings added, “not all-time records. They might be records in the new era, but they’re not records per se … It’s like plastic athletics, almost, because it’s become too common. “The currency of records has been devalued and diluted dramatically. It’s become a battle of the lab guys, as much as the guys running out on the roads and on the tracks.” These days a prominent broadcaster at marathon races around the world, Hutchings suggests that running’s record books should be updated to reflect the introduction of super shoes, essentially splitting the sport into two separate eras. “We’re still in a period of turmoil and discovery, and there is time to create a ruling, is my feeling, albeit a retrospective one,” he added. In written comments to CNN, World Athletics, the sport’s global governing body, said that world records “across all our disciplines and events evolve over time.” It added: “Throughout the history of our sport, world records were always set with the best technology available at the time, it is no different today. “Beyond technology, there are many factors which contribute to the constant improvement of athletic performances in our sport … We are in the midst of an exciting era for our sport, and we welcome the extraordinary quality of competition we are currently witnessing which is down to the coaching, training and hard work of our talented athletes.” It is unlikely that world records will be set at this weekend’s New York City Marathon, due to the undulating, challenging nature of the course, but you can guarantee that both casual and elite runners will be taking to the start line in a pair of super shoes. While Nike was the first company to make carbon-plated footwear publicly available, most major running brands now have their own models, including Puma, New Balance, Asics, and Saucony. One criticism often leveled against the technology is that runners respond differently to the footwear, meaning some reap a greater performance advantage from them than others. A 2017 study, which was funded by Nike, found that a prototype shoe with a stiff, embedded plate “reduce[d] the energetic cost of running by an average of 4% compared with established marathon racing shoes” and acknowledged that there was “considerable inter-individual variation in the amount of energetic saving” the shoes offered. “The problem with this technology is it’s randomly selected,” said Hutchings. “Some people really benefit from it massively, and other people I think are probably neutral responders and can hardly get any assistance from it depending on their gaits and their biomechanics.” Thompson has other reservations about super shoes. Anecdotally, he has heard about an increase in foot and calf injuries from athletes regularly wearing carbon-plated spikes on a running track, and also believes that wearing super shoes too often – either on tracks or roads – can compromise a runner’s performance in the long term. “If you train in these, what potentially could happen is that you reduce the body’s ability to optimize its own biokinetic energy,” said Thompson. Biokinetic energy, a term that Thompson has introduced and defined himself, largely refers to the ways in which the joints, muscles, tendons and fascia in the body store and return energy, helping to improve running economy. “A lot of people say, well, people recover faster from training in the super shoes and therefore they can do more training, better training,” he added. “I’m not convinced of that. “What I believe I’m seeing is that those who train all the time in super shoes will reduce their body’s ability to optimize biokinetic energy production. So overall, you’ll see a net decrease from where you were.” Thompson said, though, that he is a “lone voice” on how wearing super shoes for racing and training could be detrimental to a runner’s overall performance. “My recommendation is it’s probably best to train in the cheapest, conventional shoes that are available and then save your super spikes and your super shoes for your races and for the occasional time trial,” he said. World Athletics told CNN that it has done “an enormous amount of work” to ensure that its shoe regulations “support innovation on the one hand, while also ensuring that shoe technology does not create unfairness or a paradigm shift in athletic performances on the other.” But Hutchings argues that the governing body should have been more stringent about regulating new shoe technology, saying: “I feel as though they have left the barn door ajar, the horse has bolted and they just cannot get it back under control.” Now, he finds himself longing for the days when little thought or discussion was dedicated to what shoes were on runners’ feet. “It has blown the sport of distance running into a new stratosphere, a new level of performance,” said Hutchings, “and not in an all-round fair way.”",Sports
"After her three children died, 85-year-old Mavis Paterson cycled 1,000 miles around Scotland"," Cycling has become more than a habit for “Granny Mave,” as Mavis Paterson is known. It has become essential for her very being, her very reason for living after all three of her adult children passed away within four years of each other – Sandy in 2012, Katie in 2013 and Bob in 2016. It was in memory of her children that the 85-year-old grandmother set out on her latest endurance challenge in May, cycling 1,000 miles around Scotland, beginning from the Mull of Galloway, before heading north, tracing the outline of the country until she reached the Mull of Galloway again. “If I didn’t have my bicycle, and this is terrible to say, I don’t think I would want to live,” she told CNN Sport. “To lose your complete family, it’s just unbelievable. My daughter once said, because one of her friends had died, and she said: ‘Oh mum, imagine losing a child.’ I said: ‘I know. I couldn’t imagine it.’ All mine have gone.” Cycling has provided some solace, some way for her to cope with unimaginable loss. “It’s been hard for me, but I’ve managed and people say, ‘Oh, you’re strong,’ and I don’t know where the strength comes from,” she said. “They ask me. I don’t know. I cope, my bike helps and I’ve got wonderful friends.” Paterson cycled every day for a month around the circumference of Scotland, navigating its undulating landscape, exposed roads and unpredictable weather. Every day, she woke up early and set out riding – covering up to 50 miles a day – and raising money for British-based charity Macmillan Cancer Support. All along the route, Paterson recalled other cyclists coming out to keep her company, offering “terrific support,” some of them riding with her for several days at a time. “A lot of them have all the cycling gear, the cleats in the bike and all the lycra,” she said. “I don’t have any of that stuff at all. I’ve got ordinary pedals. I can’t do (cleats)… I’d be falling off the bike all the time… I’m just a happy cyclist.” Such support was a constant throughout Paterson’s odyssey across Scotland, culminating in a crowd at the finish line who had gathered to cheer her on. “And in the middle of (the crowd), I’ve got a grandson who’s 6-foot-3-inches, and I saw him, and I just ran towards him and it was just so exhilarating,” she said, before adding that she celebrated her achievement with a glass of merlot. Along the way, too, she celebrated her 85th birthday, an occasion marked by a party in the Scottish town of Moffat, in between summitting hills on her ride. “I hope I don’t have to go off my bicycle,” Patterson recalls thinking when cycling over the steepest hill on her ride. “But I didn’t. I managed to get the top. I huffed and puffed and people say: ‘Why don’t you get an electric bike?’ And I say: ‘Well, no, no, I don’t want a bike that does all the work.’ I want to do the work on the hills, so that when I get to the top, I say: ‘Hey, I did that.’” Previously accustomed to running marathons and half marathons, Paterson took up cycling when her knees began giving her problems. She started setting herself challenges; in 2008, she cycled across Canada with her friend, though she rode part of it solo when her friend suffered health problems. Cycling across Saskatchewan province, Paterson remembers “miles and miles of roads and fields (with) nothing really there,” and “although I was lonely, I never felt lonely… I used to talk to my bicycle… and make a joke of it all.” Then in 2019, she cycled the length of Great Britain, from its most southern point at Lands End to its most northern point at John O’Groats, becoming the oldest ever woman to complete the famous route. With each challenge, Paterson raised money for Macmillan Cancer Support – which provides healthcare, advice and support for those affected by the disease – and her cycle around Scotland alone has so far raised almost £70,000 ($88,000) for the charity, more than double her initial target of £30,000 ($38,000). “I’m just amazed at how generous people are, and I’m so glad I can give money like that to them,” she said. The training for such an endeavor required Paterson to go out cycling in all types of weather, five or six times a week. “When you’re my age, if you don’t train and you think you can go do something, well you can’t,” she says. “It’s tough training. The training I managed, I didn’t feel old at all.” Paterson intends to embark on more endurance challenges and fundraising in the future, continuing to ride in memory of her children. “I know people have got on their bikes and thought, ‘If that old lady can do it, I can do it.’ And also people who have been a bit depressed and thought, ‘Oh gosh, I shouldn’t be like this. Look at poor Mave, she’s lost all her children.’ So a lot of people have taken up cycling because of my cycle rides and just inspired people apparently,” she said. “People keep saying that I’m an inspiration. Well, if I am that’s great, I’m happy about that.”",Sports
"After a life-changing diagnosis, this Frenchman is embracing his ‘second chance at life’"," As Cyril Del Pistoia sat on the edge of his hospital bed, struggling to move his legs, the likelihood of ever competing in an IRONMAN event seemed an unattainable dream. The Frenchman, who now lives in the US, was recovering from leukemia and underwent invasive treatment, including a bone marrow transplant, which left him with the task of learning to walk again. But, 10 years on from his transplant, Del Pistoia lined up to compete at this year’s IRONMAN World Championship event in his hometown of Nice, France which saw competitors complete a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike race and a marathon-distance run. It was a moment the 35-year-old had always hoped for, but one that seemed impossible when he was in the depths of recovery. “It was always a dream, it has always been in the back of my head,” he told CNN Sport. “But while in the hospital, to be honest, at that point it was just survival. It was just, I want to be able to walk a little bit. You’re just focusing so much on the little things. “It just hurts so much just to even eat food. At that point, my goal was just to be alive.” Del Pistoia has always been interested in sport, playing rugby as a child in France before taking up cycling and eventually participating in triathlons. He fell in love with the “strategic components” of triathlons, learning how to best pace himself throughout the swim, cycle and run elements. Despite not becoming a professional athlete, he continued pursuing his love for the sport, balancing it alongside his education and career. But, in 2012, everything changed. Del Pistoia had been travelling a lot between France and the US for work and began feeling more fatigued than usual. After experiencing pain in his upper chest, he eventually went to his doctor and was handed a devastating, life-changing diagnosis. “When she [the doctor] got the results, I just remember the look on her face and she just told me to go straight to the hospital,” he said. He underwent more tests to confirm the initial suspicions and was eventually told that he had leukemia. “It was really tough,” he recalled. “For some weird reason, I always felt like I would go through something tough, medically speaking, so I was like ‘all right, this is the time’. “You’re just there processing the information.” He was admitted to intensive care the very next day where he started chemotherapy. Initially, the treatment worked, but after a month-and-a-half in the hospital, his recovery started plateauing. He then says he opted for a new experimental treatment which offered new hope. It worked and reached a point where doctors could no longer find measurable amounts of cancer cells in his blood. However, to decrease the likelihood of the cancer returning, Del Pistoia underwent a bone marrow transplant. Matching with a suitable donor was not an easy task and after eventually finding one the Frenchman had to go through radiotherapy to receive the new stem cells. He remembers very little of that time, describing it like “living a parallel life” where his body was in the hospital, but his mind was elsewhere. “I have no memory of what happened,” he said before explaining how the treatment effectively burnt his entire body. It left the sport fanatic with a number of lasting issues, including damaged lungs and very low resistance to heat – not ideal for someone who was desperate to get back to the sport of triathlon, he joked. But, after weeks of treatment, his body started to respond. Del Pistoia was then able to turn his attention to recovering from an ordeal that had weakened him so much even sitting in bed was a struggle. He remembered how painful it was to even attempt eating and drinking small amounts of food and water, as well as the intense feeling of having his first shower in almost two months. “I remember sitting on the bed with my feet hanging out and just trying to move my legs up, just a few centimetres each, little by little, trying to regain control of my legs. “Then, at some point, I was able to stand up. Then, after being able to stand up, I was able to walk.” Recovery was slow but, bit by bit, Del Pistoia started to rebuild his life. After a year, he started working offshore again and also began rebuilding his fitness. In the early days of his diagnosis, he had asked for an exercise bike in his hospital room. Now, he was able to go wherever he wanted on two wheels. Training was an important aspect of his life before the illness, but sport took on a slightly new meaning post-recovery, he said. Instead of focusing so much on times and physical improvement, Del Pistoia enjoyed every bit of his “second chance at life.” In 2020, he competed in the biathlon at the World Transplant Winter Games in Canada and returned to the world stage in April to compete in the triathlon at the World Transplant Summer Games in Australia, finishing first in his age category. The Games, which occur every two years with summer and winter sports taking place in alternating years, are primarily open to people who have received a solid organ transplant (liver, heart, lung, kidney, pancreas) or bone marrow transplant. “It’s amazing because you compete with people with similar difficulties in life. They all have been through something and they all have a story to tell,” he said. “People look at me and I think I’m really fit. I can run pretty fast and I can cycle pretty fast, I can do an Ironman. “But at the same time, I still have a lot of limitations. So it’s good to be around people that really, truly understand that.” This year, in a full-circle moment, he was invited to Nice as a special participant in September’s IRONMAN World Championship race. Knowing he was not able to compete with some of the the top athletes in the world, Del Pistoia was just thankful to be given the opportunity to participate. It being hosted in his hometown made the experience all the more symbolic, he said. “My performance was very, very secondary there. I just wanted to enjoy every aspect of it,” he added. “I wanted to make sure my story was heard, because that makes me really happy to see. At the end of the day, that’s what drives me the most, if I can inspire people. “If I know people are struggling in the hospital right now and are hearing a story like mine, just helping them go through to tomorrow, then I’ve won my day. “Just for them to know there’s more than just the light at the end of the tunnel, you can still do extraordinary things with life.” On the day, Del Pistoia was happy with the swim and cycle he put together, but said he overheated during the run. It meant he had to take the final leg of the race slower than he wanted, but crossing the finish line was no less emotional and he couldn’t hold back the tears. Now, with a IRONMAN World Championship race in the bag, Del Pistoia is on the hunt for more challenges. He says he hasn’t ruled out qualifying for an Ironman 70.3 World Championship race – otherwise known as a half IRONMAN – in the future and has some long-distance running races on the horizon. Away from sport, Del Pistoia has recently qualified as a seaplane pilot and wants to use his platform to raise awareness and improve accessibility for those living with disabilities. “I would love it if I can share my story more and more in a way that I can inspire people and I can help people. That’s very much where I see my value in this world,” he said. “If I can help people while they’re struggling, that truly makes me happy, more than any [sporting] performance.”",Sports
American soldiers brought breakdancing to South Korea. Now it’s writing its own history," When hip-hop-obsessed American soldiers showed their Korean counterparts how to land headspins and windmills at US military bases in the 1980s, they probably didn’t anticipate breakdancing’s eventual explosion in the country. Upon reaching Korea’s shores, it was Korean-American hip-hop promoter John Jay Chon who, having handed out VHS tapes of tutorials and competitions to Seoul’s underground dance and club scenes, was widely credited for igniting the boom. Breakdancing entered the Korean mainstream in the 1990s through K-pop trailblazers Seo Taiji & Boys’ mesmeric music videos, a modern phenomenon seemingly at odds with the country’s conservative culture at the time. Then came the noughties, widely seen as the country’s breakdancing “golden years,” when Korean crews won multiple titles at Battle of the Year, one of the top international b-boy competitions. As the first generation of K-pop – which similarly incorporated US hip-hop conventions – took over South Korea on its way to global domination, the country’s tourism board began investing millions of dollars into breakdancing competitions, likely hoping it would lead to a similar K-wave. The baggy jeans, boomboxes and tattoos that had once captured pop culture in the United States – breakdancing even featured at President Ronald Reagan’s inauguration in 1985 – experienced a similar lull in mainstream Korea by the mid-2010s. But it never went away – and is now in a resurgence that will next year take Korean b-boys and b-girls to the Olympics. This weekend, breakdancing – or “breaking” as it is known in official competitions – will make its debut at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, ahead of its hotly anticipated introduction to the Summer Games in Paris next year. Breaking, started by Black and Latino youths in the Bronx in the 1970s, is an assortment of dance styles such as “locking,” “popping,” and “uprocking,” blended into one physically demanding expression. Those in the industry prefer not to restrict breaking to a single category such as an art-form or sport, but refer to it as a “culture.” Rules and judging in a new-era sporting setting are still in their infancy. In Hangzhou, two medals will be awarded in the men’s and women’s categories. Asia’s best b-boys and b-girls will take turns to perform routines in one-on-one battles and are judged on six categories, according to organizers: perfomativity, musicality, personality, creativity, variety and technique. Though there is no official ranking by governing body World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), South Korea has long been among the world’s best. Kim Heon-woo, also known as B-boy Wing, leads Team Korea’s breaking team in Hangzhou. The veteran, from the legendary Jinjo Crew, is a multiple world champion and Asian Games gold medal contender. Kim is hoping for a “good result” at the Games, in what is South Korea’s largest delegation in history at the quadrennial event. There is added motivation after the country’s emphatic success in fellow Asian Games debutant, esports. “There have been ups and downs but we always believed that the chance would come one day. We’ve worked hard for it,” Kim, who has been breaking for more than two decades, told CNN. Breaking had seen a glimmer of a return to its glory days through its exposure on popular dance survival TV reality show “Street Woman Fighter”in 2021 and “Street Man Fighter” in 2022, which Kim starred in. “You can see the value of breaking as a sport. I think this is an important beginning to the future,” Kim said. “Hip-hop and breaking began in the US. Now each country is developing new types of dances to suit their own characteristics. There’s still some unfamiliarity with each other, but there is more recognition and interest in our dances.” While Kim has an eye on Paris 2024, the Asian Games is undeniably a milestone for what is probably the last batch of first-generation Korean breakers. “It’s their last dance, essentially,” said Kwon Jang-ho, a Seoul-based journalist who is producing a documentary on the history of breaking in Korea. Kwon, who started breaking in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s before discovering the fledgling Korean scene in his university gap year, had witnessed its “domination for about 10 years.” “Korea pretty much won everything you could think of in terms of global titles. There was never really a single country that had dominated a scene like it had at the time. It was crazy to see. But since then, no real ‘new generation’ has emerged,” he said. “With the Asian Games and Olympics coming up, it’s kind of like the last redemption of the golden generation,” Kwon added, saying he hoped for a “revival” of the scene post-Games. “It would be quite the statement to say, ‘hey look, we’re still around. We’re still at the top of Asia’. It was kind of past its heyday, but these guys are essentially trying for one last big moment of glory – to inspire more generations, and not just in Korea,” he said. That breaking has transcended into the sports realm can only mean good things, said Chen Po Chun, or Bboy Bojin, the Asian Games’ breaking chair and WDSF’s head of breaking division. “The world we’re living in now is moving so fast. The result may not be to the liking of everyone involved, but it’s about learning,” said Chen, who has been breaking for 30 years. “South Korea is really important, alongside Japan, and even China now. All of these countries have contributed to different eras and have put impressive energy into breaking. We should be grateful, blessed and appreciative to have what it is we have now. “At the Asian Games, we will see all of this. Legends, young stars, super athletes, nobodies turning into somebodies, all battling it out. It’s a good example for other Asian countries; breaking will keep leveling up and make more people fall in love.”",Sports
Saudi Arabia is trying to disrupt soccer’s world order. The reasons why might surprise you," When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé – including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year – it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbappé might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (€90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe’s major leagues – France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga and the English Premier League – according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation’s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia’s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. “Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an interview with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: “I don’t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent.” Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world’s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants “to drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,” though it’s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop “young Saudi talent.” During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (€353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees – all international stars – play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was “not in [the SPL’s] competitive advantage” to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (£700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (£12 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers “just aren’t true.” “Essentially, the signal is ‘We mean business,’” Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.“We’ve got so much money that for a player who is … coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he’s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,” Chadwick said, describing Saudi’s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries – including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi’s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country’s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi’s victory over Argentina during last year’s men’s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. “For example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you’re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,” Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of “The Price of Football” podcast. “From the Saudi authorities’ point of view, they’re getting a ready-made product. Everybody’s heard of Benzema. Everybody’s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,” Maguire said. Saudi Arabia’s lofty sporting ambitions don’t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men’s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt – although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between €35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country’s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals – and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30. Of this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia’s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring – and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, “what is just as significant is the security of the royal family,” Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. “What we’re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,” Chadwick said. “You want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it … But don’t question us,” Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer “can be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.” At the same time, there has been “a significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country” this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. “Reputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and … Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,” James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, “The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,” explains. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick – not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. “Part of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that’s a way of attracting interest to the country,” said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of “sportswashing” its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia’s purported “sportswashing,” the kingdom’s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: “People that don’t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they’ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. “See what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,” he added. Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, “they feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.” In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up “owning golf.” Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men’s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport’s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. “They have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,” he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. “As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don’t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don’t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,” he said last month. “When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they’re playing.” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: “I don’t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. “I don’t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can’t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?” he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is “no different from what the Premier League have done.” “There was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we’re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,” said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league’s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. “We can’t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.”  But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which “simply doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia,” Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams’ spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy – up from its current value of “0.000 something.” “They’ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,” Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world’s domestic leagues. “That is feasible given the amount of money that they’re spending.” “I think they’re realistic. They don’t say that they’re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,” Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world’s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA’s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA’s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour’s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league’s financial endeavors, “nobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.” “This vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,” Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is “signaling.” “It is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.”",Sports
Frustrated golfer throws club into tree – loses two more trying to retrieve it," Losing a golf club in a tree? Unlikely. Losing two? Inconceivable. Losing three? All in a day’s work for Joost Luiten. The Dutch golfer had already been enduring a Sunday to forget at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai when his drive from the ninth tee went sailing left into a bunker. Two-over in the final round and coming off a bogey on the previous hole, frustrations boiled over for the 37-year-old, who launched his uncooperative driver towards a nearby tree at Jumeirah Golf Estate’s Earth Course. His driver lodged firmly between the branches above his head, so Luiten sent a second – then third – club to the same fate in an effort to dislodge the first. Meanwhile, his caddie copied the tactic with a fallen branch, as a volunteer clambered up the tree in an effort to shake the clubs out. Six-time DP World Tour winner Luiten then cycled through a series of other ultimately futile remedies – jumping, poking the tree with the roaming scoreboard, and throwing branches –  before admitting defeat, kicking his golf bag in one final act of frustration then heading off to play his next shot. “Taking tree trouble to the next level,” posted the DP World Tour on its X account. Luiten bogeyed the hole, but was given a lift at the 10th tee when his clubs – eventually retrieved by a volunteer – were hand-delivered by his wife Melanie-Jane, who is eight months pregnant with their first child. Three birdies in a row soon followed but ultimately came too little too late, as a final round one-over 73 saw Luiten sign off at three-over overall, 48th of the 50-player field. “I was frustrated, one of those weeks [when] nothing went my way,” Luiten told reporters. “Lost it and threw my driver and it got stuck up a tree. That sums up my week nicely … one of the volunteers got them out, otherwise it would have been a funny round to finish with 11 clubs.” Denmark’s Nicolai Hojgaard carded a blistering final round eight-under 64 to take victory, a run of five straight birdies on the back nine powering him to his third DP World Tour win. The 22-year-old finished on 21-under overall, two shots ahead of Ryder Cup teammates Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland, as well as England’s Matt Wallace. “It means a lot, it’s the sweetest one,” Hojgaard told reporters. “This year has been a really good year if I look back on it, I feel like the only thing missing was a win, and to get it this week, with this field, is unbelievable.”",Sports
Tiger Woods to make first competitive start since Masters withdrawal at Hero World Challenge," Tiger Woods is set for his first competitive appearance in seven months at the Hero World Challenge later this month. The 47-year-old has not played a tournament since his early withdrawal from The Masters in April but will tee off as tournament host at the unofficial PGA Tour event in Albany, The Bahamas, on November 30, organizers announced Saturday. Woods underwent ankle surgery in May after enduring “constant” pain across his three rounds at Augusta National the previous month, only his second competitive appearance of 2023. Started in 2000 and staged as a benefit to Woods’ TGR Foundation, the Hero World Challenge will see the five-time event winner compete as part of a 20-player invitational field featuring many of the game’s top players, including world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Viktor Hovland, Max Homa and Matt Fitzpatrick. American trio Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas are also set to play, with Justin Rose and Lucas Glover making the field as tournament exemptions. Fifteen-time major winner Woods has prioritized appearances at the four major championships in his sporadic competitive appearances since suffering severe leg injuries in a car crash two years ago but missed the three subsequent flagship events following The Masters as he recovered from May’s surgery. He has not been totally absent from the course, however, appearing at various points to support – and even caddie for – his son Charlie at various junior tournaments. Woods was on bag duty for his son as he won his Junior National Golf Championship qualifier in Orlando in September, then took up a supporting role as the 14-year-old helped his Benjamin School boys team clinch the Florida High School state championship earlier this month. In January, Woods is slated to play in The TGL, a televised indoor golf league staged in partnership with the PGA Tour and created by TMRW Sports, a company he co-founded alongside Rory McIlroy.",Sports
Tiger Woods’ son Charlie wins high school state golf championship," His father was one of the most decorated teenage golfers to play the game. Now, Charlie Woods is adding to his own junior trophy cabinet. The 14-year-old was part of the Benjamin School boys team that clinched the Florida High School Athletic Association Class A state championship on Wednesday, helping secure a fourth title for the Palm Beach school. Freshman Woods carded rounds of 78 and 76 at Mission Inn Resort and Club in Howey-In-The-Hills, Florida, the fourth best score of his five-strong team, all while his father Tiger, clad in black, watched on. He finished tied-26th in the individual rankings as the Benjamin School Buccaneers edged a one-shot victory. The 47-year-old Woods had caddied for his son when he triumphed at his Junior National Golf Championship qualifier in Orlando in September, but had to settle for a spectator’s view this time around. The 15-time major winner never lifted a state championship, though there is a caveat to his son’s bragging rights – his father never actually had the opportunity to win one. The California Interscholastic Federation did not stage the competition during Woods’ spell at Western High School in Anaheim, California. Not that it put much of a dent in his résumé. As a 15-year-old student at the school in 1991, Woods became the then-youngest US Junior Amateur champion, and would go on to three-peat the event. Within a year of turning professional in August 1996, he had won three PGA Tour events, become the youngest winner of The Masters at 21 and the fastest player to reach No. 1 in the world after turning pro. Today, Woods sits at World No. 1307, a third-round withdrawal from The Masters in April being his last competitive appearance, and the most recent of the sporadic few he has made since suffering severe leg injuries in a serious car crash in 2021. However, he is set to play in The TGL in January, a televised indoor golf league organized by TMRW Sports, a company Woods co-founded alongside Rory McIlroy.",Sports
Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished," For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death. Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks. From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard. A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats. River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium. Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s. Neither did severe flooding. Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996. The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters. As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013. Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green. There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast. “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN. “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.” That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010. Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared. The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date. Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor. A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls. Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking. Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on. “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said. Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are. Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers. Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013. Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long. One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002. A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented. “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN. “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.” Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown. It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann. Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing. Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance. Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club. “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said. “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it. “We’d love to see them again.” Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake. Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere. Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks. “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said. “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark. “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”",Sports
Mohamed Salah targeted by pitch invaders during Egypt match; escorted off by men in military uniforms," Mohamed Salah was escorted off the pitch by men in military uniforms at the end of Egypt’s World Cup qualifier against Sierra Leone after pitch invaders targeted the Liverpool star on Sunday. In the 89th minute of the match, with Egypt 2-0 up, footage on social media shows stewards in high-vis yellow jackets running onto the pitch and tackling a pitch invader close to where Salah was standing. Stewards could then be seen throwing punches at the perpetrator on the floor, before guiding him off the pitch at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex in Paynesville, Liberia. Simultaneously, at least one other spectator attempted to reach Salah, but was chased away by stadium staff and some of the Egyptian forward’s teammates. In another video on social media, a shirtless Salah could be seen being escorted off the pitch by men in military uniform, while some people tried to take selfies with the star. The 31-year-old Salah appeared to be undisturbed by what had happened and looked calm as he walked off the pitch. CNN reached out to the Confederation of African Football, FIFA, the Egyptian FA and the Sierra Leone soccer federation for comment but had not received a response at time of publication. Salah hasn’t publicly spoken about the pitch invasion on social media, though he posted an Instagram picture on Monday, with a picture of a young mascot looking up slightly in awe of the Egyptian international before the game started. The match was also eventful, with Sierra Leone finishing the game with nine men after two red cards. Meanwhile, a brace from Trézéguet secured Egypt’s 2-0 win as it continued its impressive start to the qualifying campaign. It sits unbeaten at the top of Group A after two matches, having previously thrashed Djibouti 6-0 on Thursday. Salah will now return to Liverpool ahead of a much-anticipated match against Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday. CNN reached out to Liverpool for comment on the incident but had not received a response by time of publication.",Sports
France beats Gibraltar a record 14-0 in Euro 2024 qualifier," It was a night that will live long in the memory for France fans as Les Bleus thrashed 10-man Gibraltar by an astonishing 14-0 in their European Championship qualifying match, with Kylian Mbappé scoring a hat trick. This was the world’s No. 2-ranked team playing against a country ranked 198 in the world and the gulf between the two was evident on the pitch. It was the biggest winning margin in the history of the qualifiers, surpassing Germany’s 13-0 thumping of San Marino in 2006, and marked the first time a European team had scored 14 goals in a World Cup or European Championship qualifying match, according to Reuters. Mbappé’s long-range effort to complete his hat trick was the pick of France’s goals in the Allianz Riviera, Nice, on a night where seven goals were scored in each half. Warren Zaïre-Emery, aged 17 years, eight months and 11 days, also made history as he became France’s youngest player since 1914 and marked his debut with a first-half goal. The night started badly for Gibraltar when Ethan Santos put the ball into his own net after just three minutes and from there on things unraveled for the visitors as Santos was shown a red card in the 18th minute for a foul on Zaïre-Emery, which ended the teenager’s participation. Marcus Thuram, Jonathan Clauss, Youssouf Fofana, Adrien Rabiot, Ousmane Dembélé all scored for France, while Olivier Giroud and Kingsley Coman got two goals apiece. “Being down to 10, already with 11 it’s complicated for them, but it doesn’t take away the credit for us even if we could have been more efficient, it’s as much about respecting the opponent as scoring goals,” France manager Didier Deschamps said, per Reuters. “Fourteen is not bad.” France had 39 attempts on goal, 19 of which were on target, while Gibraltar failed to muster a chance. France, already qualified for Euro 2024 in Germany, is top of Group B while a winless Gibraltar is bottom on zero points without having yet scored a goal during qualification.",Sports
Luis Díaz inspires Colombia to emotional victory as his father watches from stands after kidnap release," Luis Díaz scored two goals to help Colombia stun Brazil in a World Cup qualifier on Thursday, as his father watched on from the stands just a week after being released by kidnappers. Luis Manuel Díaz looked overcome with emotion as he witnessed his son net an impressive second-half brace to fire Colombia to a 2-1 win inside packed Estadio Metropolitano. On October 28, Díaz Sr. was abducted along with his wife, Cilenis Marulanda, by ELN gunmen in his hometown of Barrancas, northeastern Colombia. Marulanda was rescued later that day, but Díaz Sr. was handed over just under two weeks later to a mixed commission of UN personnel and Catholic priests on Thursday in nearby city Valledupar. He was reunited with his son earlier this week, ahead of Thursday’s match in Barranquilla, Colombia. Gabriel Martinelli had given Brazil an early lead in the game, but Díaz responded with two goals in four second-half minutes. The first came in the 75th minute, with Díaz directing his header into the bottom corner of the net as a cross found its way to the Liverpool star. While the forward celebrated the equaliser, television footage showed his emotional father, wearing in a Colombia shirt, cheering along. Just moments later and the pair were celebrating again. Díaz timed his run brilliantly again and leapt above a Brazilian defender to score another header past his Liverpool teammate and Brazil goalkeeper Allison in the 79th minute. The stadium erupted with the goal, as Díaz jumped over the advertising boards to be closer to the fans. Footage once again showed Díaz Sr. passionately celebrating with tears in his eyes. “I’m grateful to my teammates, to the coaching staff who were always there for me at every moment,” Díaz said, according to BBC Sport. “And I dedicate the victory to the people, who deserved it.” It was a cathartic evening for the Díaz family, but another bad one for Brazil, which has now lost its second consecutive World Cup qualifier match. The five-time World Cup champion has now slipped to fifth in the qualifying standings, with Colombia up to third. Elsewhere, Argentina suffered a 2-0 loss to Uruguay on Thursday in its World Cup qualifier – the first time the world champion has been beaten since losing to Saudi Arabia in the World Cup group stages last year. Goals from Ronald Araújo and Darwin Núnez were enough for Uruguay, with Lionel Messi unable to inspire his lacklustre side. The Ballon d’Or winner did come close to scoring though, hitting the crossbar with a freekick in the second half. “We never felt comfortable, didn’t find a way to end up with the ball or the control of the actions, were not able to have long possessions, didn’t create chances and played the game that they wanted, in their rhythm,” Messi told TyC Sports, per Reuters. “They are a physical team that bring a lot of danger in the counter-attacks and they showed that with the goals they scored.” Argentina remains top of the qualifying standings with 12 points, with Uruguay now just two points behind in second. There are 18 rounds in South America’s World Cup qualifying system, with the top six teams progressing to the 2026 event while the seventh-placed country will go into the FIFA play-off tournament, which will involve six countries from other continents.",Sports
Amnesty International says ‘abuses persist’ and ‘too little has been done’ to protect workers after Qatar World Cup," Leading human rights organization Amnesty International claims that the legacy for migrant workers in Qatar following the 2022 World Cup is in “serious peril” as the one-year anniversary of the tournament nears. In a briefing titled “A Legacy in Jeopardy,” Amnesty International said that it “finds that just as the glare of the world’s media spotlight dimmed, so too did the [Qatar] government’s push for fair conditions and decent work for the hundreds of thousands of men and women who helped realize Qatar’s World Cup dream and will continue to keep the country moving for many years to come.” In a statement sent to CNN, Qatar’s International Media Office responded to Amnesty International’s findings, stating the “positive impact of Qatar’s labor reforms is evident for all to see.” The statement read: “The World Cup accelerated labor reforms in Qatar, creating a significant and lasting tournament legacy. Qatar now leads the region on workers’ rights and labor reforms, setting an example for other countries on how a system can be successfully overhauled. “The commitment to strengthen Qatar’s labor system and safeguard workers’ rights was never an initiative tied to the World Cup and was always intended to continue long after the tournament ended.” Amnesty International said that some previous issues had been improved – workers were able to leave the country and are more freely able to change jobs. However, the organization maintained that, despite FIFA and Qatar’s claims of progress, not enough has been done for workers’ rights in Qatar. “Reforms belatedly introduced and weakly enforced by the Qatari government, and FIFA’s introduction of a human right policy in 2017, failed to prevent widespread abuses occurring in the lead up to and during the tournament, and abuses continue today,” the human rights organization added. In the build-up to last year’s World Cup, the organizers received widespread criticism for their treatment of migrant workers. In 2021, The Guardian reported that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat. The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN. Hassan Al Thawadi, the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations, told CNN’s Becky Anderson that The Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context. In a 2021 report, Amnesty International said that Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states. Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Economic Social Justice, believes that Qatar “must renew efforts to improve workers’ rights.” He added: “Qatar’s continued failure to properly enforce or strengthen its pre-World Cup labor reforms puts any potential legacy for workers in serious peril. “The government must urgently renew its commitment to protecting workers, while both FIFA and Qatar should agree to remediation plans for all those who suffered.” The organization said that it is unaware of improvements in investigating workers’ deaths, that wages continue to be stolen from workers by employers and that migrant workers’ rights continue to be abused. Amnesty International also reiterated its 10-point plan which was published in the build-up to the 2022 World Cup. The plan includes calls to end forced labor, allow trade unions and to compensate historic abuses. In support of Qatar, FIFA added that it is “undeniable that significant progress has taken place,” in a statement sent to CNN. But soccer’s international governing body admitted: “It is equally clear that the enforcement of such transformative reforms takes time and that heightened efforts are needed to ensure the reforms benefit all workers in the country.”",Sports
Novak Djokovic’s 19-match winning streak ended by Italian youngster Jannik Sinner," Jannik Sinner brought Novak Djokovic’s 19-match unbeaten run to an end on Tuesday, defeating the world No. 1 at the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy. Sinner, 22, was cheered on by a partisan home crowd as he won the group match 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-2) – his first career victory against the 24-time grand slam singles champion. “That was a really high-level match,” the world No. 4 Italian said after the win, per ATP. “I think I was really brave and intelligent in important moments, especially the third set. “I felt like we were both serving really well, so there were not so many exchanges, but when the exchanges were played, we both played really well.” Sinner is part of a new generation of players threatening to take over from the likes of Djokovic, who is 14 years his senior. There were times during Tuesday’s match when the Serbian superstar, arguably the greatest player of all time, could only applaud what his opponent was producing on the other side of the net. Sinner’s booming ground strokes caused consistent problems for Djokovic, who seemed to spend much of the match battling to stay in the contest. Even when Djokovic used his experience to turn up the pressure, Sinner seemed to find an extra gear – ending the match with an overhead smash after racing ahead in the final set tie-break. The pair shared a warm embrace at the net after the match, as the Italian crowd applauded its home hero. “I think the main difference is that, in the important points, he was going for it, he was more courageous,” Djokovic said, per ATP. “He deserved to win because, in important moments, I wasn’t aggressive enough, I wasn’t decisive enough. I gave him the opportunity to take the control over the points. “You have to just congratulate him. He just played a fantastic match. That’s what I told him at the net. I think in the most important moments, he played his best game and he absolutely deserved to win.” It was Sinner’s second win at this year’s ATP Finals – the end-of-season competition for men’s tennis. The Italian has not yet secured qualification into the semifinals, though, and will play Denmark’s Holger Rune on Thursday as he seeks to finish the group stage unbeaten. Meanwhile, Djokovic will play Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz, needing a win to assure progression through the group. Hurkacz came in as an alternate to Stefanos Tsitsipas after the Greek star injured his back earlier this week. The ATP Finals sees the eight top-ranked men battle it out to become the end-of-season champion. Players are split into two round-robin groups, with the winner and runner-up of each progressing to the semifinals. Djokovic is the reigning champion after beating Rune in the 2022 final. The 36-year-old has won six ATP Finals titles during his career, including four consecutive wins between 2012-2015.",Sports
Billie Jean King Cup: Leylah Fernandez guides Canada to first ever title," Leylah Fernandez led Canada to a first ever Billie Jean King Cup triumph on Sunday, securing the title with a 6-2 6-3 win over Italy’s Jasmine Paolini. Fernandez, the world No. 20, was undefeated in her five matches over the week as Canada beat Poland and host nation Spain to top Group C, before overcoming Czech Republic and then Italy in the semifinals and final. “It means the world to me,” Fernandez, the 2021 US Open finalist, told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell. “Billie Jean King has done so much for women, for tennis, for women in tennis and to be able to win the world cup of tennis in her name definitely gives me a lot of confidence, but also the group of girls and Canada a lot of confidence. “We’re just extremely proud of us and we can’t wait to celebrate tonight and we can’t wait to bring this baby back home.” The relatively unknown Marina Stakusic, ranked 258 in the world, also played a huge role in Canada’s victory, finishing the week with a 3-1 record that included a 7-5 6-3 win over world No. 43 Martina Trevisan earlier in Sunday’s final, her first victory over a top-50 player. Stakusic, who was something of a surprise pick by Canada captain Heidi El Tabakh, also recorded upset victories over Poland’s world No. 63 Magdalena Fręch and the 65th-ranked Rebeka Masarova of Spain. “I’m so happy and honored that I could play this week, this has been the best week of my life,” Stakusic said in her on-court interview, per Reuters. The 18-year-old hasn’t played any main WTA singles event this season but has won three ITF titles since the beginning of September and emphatically repaid the faith shown in her by El Tabakh. “I don’t know what to say,” El Tabakh said. “I’m so proud of this team, these girls are incredible. It’s a dream come true.” Canada’s victory comes just a year after the men clinched the country’s first Davis Cup title. The team will receive $2.4 million for its victory, a new prize money record for the tournament. After Fernandez’s victory, the Canadian team was presented with the trophy by Billie Jean King, as well as blue jackets like those regularly worn by the legendary tennis star.",Sports
ATP Finals: Carlos Alcaraz beaten by Alexander Zverev on tournament debut," Carlos Alcaraz suffered defeat on his ATP Finals debut on Monday, as Alexander Zverev battled back from a set down to win 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4. The loss was the 20-year-old’s third in a row. It is the first time since 2021 – when he was ranked outside the top 100 – that the Spaniard has endured such a losing streak, according to the ATP. Alcaraz, who missed last year’s Finals through injury, lost to Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round of the Shanghai Masters last month and was then stunned by Roman Safiullin in the opening round of the Paris Masters. Alcaraz will have a chance to make amends in Turin, Italy when he faces Andrey Rublev on Wednesday but needs to win his two remaining group stage matches to have any chance of advancing to the semifinals. “It’s the only tournament where a loss does not knock you out,” Alcaraz said, per the ATP. “I still have a chance to continue improving and to get through the group stage. Tomorrow I’ll practise to improve everything that I didn’t do well today, which is a lot. “Even though the court is very fast, I need to be more consistent. At the end of the second set and the start of the third, I hit three or four shots out straight away. That can’t happen, although everyone has their own style. “I watch Novak, for example, and he doesn’t give anything away straight away. My consistency was really lacking against Zverev.” Alcaraz hadn’t played since that shock defeat Safiullin on October 31 after being forced to withdraw from an ATP tournament in Basel with foot and back injuries. The two-time grand slam champion said he’s been “training pretty well” and “feeling good,” but said he wasn’t happy with his “tennis level” after the defeat. “It’s been a long and demanding year,” he added. “I have to improve to get to this point of the season in better conditions, above all mentally. “It’s probably mental fatigue. If I want to win this tournament … I have to get to this point of the year relaxed with a desire to win everything that is put in front of me.” Zverev had struggled for consistency since returning to the circuit after seven months out with an ankle injury sustained at the French Open last year, but the German has started to find some form in the second half of the season, including winning titles in China and Germany. There were fears Zverev may have suffered another injury after slipping towards the end of the match and then gingerly hobbling between points, but the 26-year-old was confident it isn’t anything serious. “I didn’t twist my ankle. I kind of slipped,” he said, per the ATP. “There was a pain for a while and I don’t think any damage has been done. “I hope not and we will see when it settles down. It is nothing comparable to Paris.” Next up for Zverev is Daniil Medvedev, who beat compatriot Andrey Rublev in straight sets on Monday.",Sports
Naomi Osaka set to return to tennis at Brisbane International less than six months after giving birth," Four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka is set to return to tennis at the Brisbane International less than six months after giving birth. Osaka, a former world No. 1, hasn’t played on the WTA Tour since September 2022 and in July of this year announced the birth of her first child with American rapper Cordae. “I am really excited about getting back out on court and competing,” the 26-year-old Osaka said. “I always love starting my season in Brisbane and can’t wait to return. The Brisbane International is such a great tournament and will set me up for a brilliant comeback this summer.” The tournament runs from December 31, 2023, to January 7, 2024, and is used as a warm-up event for the Australian Open, the first grand slam of the season. Two of Osaka’s four grand slam titles have come Down Under, her most recent victory coming in 2021. At the French Open later that same year, the Japanese star revealed she had “suffered long bouts of depression” since winning her first grand slam title in 2018 and withdrew from the tournament. Osaka said in an interview with ESPN last month that she intends to play a busy schedule in 2024. “It’s definitely way more tournaments than I used to play,” she said. “So, I think some people will be happy with that. “I think it’s because I realized that I don’t know how the beginning of the year is going to go for me. I don’t know the level of play and I think I have to ease into it. “So at the very least, I’m going to set myself up for a very good end of the year.” On the men’s side of the draw, three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray has also confirmed that he’ll be competing in Brisbane, along with world No. 10 Holger Rune.",Sports
Late comebacks and perfect passers: Everything you need to know about Week 11’s Sunday NFL games," This is where the contenders begin to be sorted from the pretenders. With the halfway point of the 2023 NFL regular season in the rear-view mirror, certain teams are emerging as locks for the playoffs, others are part of the chasing pack while some squads are already looking forward to the start of next season. There was no shortage of drama around the league on Sunday as the charge towards the postseason continues – here is a look at all of Week 11’s weekend action. After going on a five-game unbeaten streak to start the season, the San Francisco 49ers were drastically brought back down to Earth after losing three straight games. However, Week 10 and 11 have seen the return of the early season Niners, as they followed up a dominant win against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a 27-14 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy, AKA the 2022 ‘Mr. Irrelevant,’ posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3, the first 49ers QB to do so since 1989, per the NFL. He threw 21-for-25 for 333 yards and three touchdowns, including a spectacular connection with Brandon Aiyuk that resulted in a 76-yard reception in the third quarter. Purdy also did not turn the ball over once on an afternoon where San Francisco’s defense was just as potent as its offense. Spearheaded by the likes of Fred Warner, Nick Bosa and the newly-acquired Chase Young, the 49ers limited the Bucs to just 287 total yards, intercepted Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield and forced a fumble from that was then recovered. The Bucs drop to 4-6 and third in the NFC South while the Niners improve to 7-3 to lead the NFC West. Despite facing a 12-point deficit with just over four minutes to go in the game, the Detroit Lions somehow managed to turn the tables at Ford Field with a 31-26 victory against the Chicago Bears. Quarterback Justin Fields returned from injury to give the Bears a massive boost as he racked up 273 total yards – 169 passing and 104 rushing – and a touchdown in the air. The defense also did its part as it picked off Lions quarterback Jared Goff on three occasions as Detroit’s offense sputtered. After Chicago kicked two field goals in the fourth quarter, things were looking bleak for the home team with the score at 26-14 with 4:15 left on the clock, but the Lions miraculously managed to reel off 17 unanswered points. Goff recovered from his earlier miscues to throw a 32-yard reception to Jameson Williams to cut the lead to five with less than three minutes remaining, before the Lions’ D turned up to force a three-and-out from Chicago. Detroit’s offense then marched downfield in just two minutes and four seconds, capped off by a short rushing touchdown by David Montgomery and a two-point conversion, to give the Lions the lead for good, before the win was sealed with a safety in the dying seconds. It was a monumental collapse from the now 3-7 Bears, who at one point looked as though they were going to ease to a comfortable victory. Meanwhile, the mood in the Motor City is jubilant as the Lions have an 8-2 record for the first time since 1962. After being upset on Monday night by the Denver Broncos, the Buffalo Bills bounced back in convincing fashion, routing the New York Jets 32-6 to improve to 6-5 on the season. Sunday’s matchup saw the debut of Joe Brady as the Bills’ new offensive coordinator, after Ken Dorsey was relieved of his duties on Tuesday. Buffalo signal-caller Josh Allen rebounded from a nightmare performance against the Broncos and looked much improved in his decision-making, avoiding turnovers aside from an unfortunate Hail Mary interception at the end of the first half. Allen ended the game 20-for-32 for 275 yards and three touchdowns. There was no such improvement from the Jets, who slip to 4-6 on the season. Gang Green only managed 155 total yards on a painful evening for the offense. After weeks of publicly backing his quarterback, New York head coach Robert Saleh appeared to finally pull the plug as Zach Wilson was benched for Tim Boyle in the second half. It is unclear who will get the start at QB against the Miami Dolphins in the NFL’s first-ever Black Friday game. One minor positive, or at least a relief, for New York is that it ended its barren run of not scoring a touchdown, finding the end zone for the first time in 41 drives. The Minnesota Vikings entered Sunday’s primetime matchup with the longest active winning streak in the NFL, but they found themselves knocked off their perch by the end of the night as the Denver Broncos claimed their fourth straight victory. The Broncos struggled to get into the end zone throughout the contest but were kept in the game by kicker Matt Lutz, who made all five of his field goal attempts. Denver had trailed since the second quarter and needed something special to steal the win. Quarterback Russell Wilson found Courtland Sutton deep in the left corner of the end zone to put the Broncos up 21-20 with 63 seconds left on the clock, before the defense got a key stop to move Denver to 5-5. Wilson had a productive evening and went 27-for-35 through the air for 259 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. His counterpart Joshua Dobbs, who has become Minnesota’s new hero, was slowed down by the Broncos defense, going 20-for-32 for 221 yards and notching both a passing and a rushing touchdown, though he threw an interception in the fourth quarter, which hindered Minnesota’s chances late. The Vikings now sit at 6-5 and second in the NFC North after their five-game win streak came to an end.

James Harden enjoys first win for LA Clippers with late four-point play against Houston Rockets," Finally, James Harden experienced that winning feeling as an LA Clipper – and he did so in style, beating the clock with a three pointer in a nail-biting win over the Houston Rockets in the NBA’s In-Season tournament. Harden, traded from the Philadelphia 76ers last month, had been 0-5 since his move, but the 106-100 win ended that losing streak as on Friday he produced his best performance for his new team. The 10-time All-Star guard scored 24 points, with nine rebounds and seven assists against his former team, including the four-point play to ice the game in the final seconds. Kawhi Leonard scored a game-high 26 points, while Paul George added 23 points in the victory. “I’m getting real close,” Harden said, per ESPN. “I’m getting close to myself, every game I feel like I’m improving.” Russell Westbrook came off the bench and ended up scoring eight points, three rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes of play. Elsewhere, Kevin Durant put on a vintage performance, scoring 38 points in the Phoenix Suns’ narrow 131-128 victory over the Utah Jazz. Devin Booker added 24 points and a career-high 15 assists. Damian Lillard tallied 27 points, while Malik Beasley added 20 points, in the Milwaukee Bucks’ 130-99 victory over the Charlotte Hornets as they remain undefeated in the In-Season tournament. LeBron James scored 35 points to lift the Los Angeles Lakers to a 107-95 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, taking the Lakers to 3-0 in the West’s Group A.",Sports
Joe Burrow ruled out for season as NFL investigates how Bengals reported the quarterback’s injury," Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a ligament in his right wrist during Thursday night’s 34-20 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. On Friday, Bengals’ head coach Zac Taylor said Burrow will likely require surgery and that the QB is “very disappointed” with the prognosis. Burrow left Thursday’s contest in the second quarter, shortly after throwing a go-ahead touchdown pass to Joe Mixon that put the Bengals ahead 10-7. Burrow was seen wincing in pain as he released the ball on the play. Afterwards, Burrow was seen on the team’s sideline trying to throw a football. He was visibly upset as he could not grip the ball and shook his head in frustration before jogging off to the locker room. “The play before it happened, I landed on the wrist a little bit, and the next play, the touchdown pass, just felt a pop in the middle of the throw,” Burrow said on Friday, according to the NFL. “Tried to give it a go but just couldn’t get it done, and obviously got the news today, so not great.” Taylor said the QB likely hurt himself during a routine play earlier in the scoring drive when Ravens outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney landed on Burrow. Burrow has suffered some serious injuries since being selected first overall in the 2020 NFL Draft out of Louisiana State University (LSU). Burrow’s rookie season was derailed after he tore his ACL and MCL in his left knee. Taylor was asked about the physical and mental toll the injuries were having on Burrow. “I think if he was a normal human being, you’d worry about it. He’s not. He is wired differently, he’s programmed differently,” Taylor said Friday. “He is just built a little bit different to be able to overcome setbacks and challenges and plays with a chip on his shoulder – all the things that you can say about a guy like that. “That’s why I’ve got confidence that he’ll respond from this the right way at the right time. That’s just part of how Joe’s built.” Burrow had reportedly been spotted on Wednesday wearing a type of brace or sleeve on his right wrist, but the QB was not listed on the Bengals injury list coming into Thursday’s game, and he told the NFL on Friday that the two injuries were unrelated. In a statement released Friday, the NFL said it was looking into whether the Bengals were in compliance with the league’s injury report policy. The league said the investigation is “routine” in situations like this one. Burrow, who led the team to the 2022 Super Bowl and last season’s AFC title game, became the highest-paid player in NFL history in September. The Ohio native signed a five-year, $275 million contract extension with Cincinnati through the 2029 season. The Bengals will now turn to undrafted, backup quarterback Jake Browning, who finished out Thursday’s game. Cincinnati’s next game is against divisional rivals the Pittsburgh Steelers on November 26.",Sports
Host Charissa Thompson apologizes after saying she fabricated NFL sideline reports; faces mounting criticism," Charissa Thompson, a Fox Sports and Amazon Prime Video “Thursday Night Football” host, has apologized after saying she used to make up reports when working as an NFL sideline reporter earlier in her career. Speaking on the “Pardon My Take” podcast, which was released on Wednesday, Thompson admitted to fabricating reports. Sideline reporters relay information they have received from players and coaches throughout NFL games to provide additional color for broadcasts. “I haven’t been fired for saying it, but I’ll say it again, I would make up the report sometimes because, A, the coach wouldn’t come out at half-time or it was too late and I was like, I didn’t want to screw up the report, so I was like, ‘I’m just gonna make this up,’” Thompson told the “Pardon My Take” podcast. “No coach is gonna get mad if I say, ‘Hey, we need to stop hurting ourselves, we need to be better on third down, we need to stop turning the ball over and do a better job of getting off the field,’” added Thompson, who started work as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports during the late 2000s. “Like, they’re not gonna correct me on that. I’m like, it’s fine, I’ll just make up the report.” Thompson, who previously hosted an afternoon program on ESPN, is now host of Fox Sports’ Sunday “NFL Kickoff” and Amazon Prime Video’s “Thursday Night Football.” She posted a statement on Instagram Friday, clarifying comments she made in the podcast. “When on a podcast this week, I said I would make up reports early in my career when I worked as a sideline reporter before I transitioned to my current host role,” she said. “Working in the media I understand how important words are and I chose wrong words to describe the situation. I’m sorry. I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster. “In the absence of a coach providing any information that could further my report I would use information that I learned and saw during the first half to create my report. For example if a team was 0 for 7 on 3rd down, that would clearly be an area they need to improve on in the second half. In these instances I never attributed anything said to a player or coach. “I have nothing but respect for the sideline reporters and for the tireless work they put in behind the scenes and on the field. I am only appreciative and humbled to work alongside some of the best in the business and call them some of my best friends.” Her comments on the podcast had drawn widespread criticism from other sports journalists, including from ESPN reporter Lisa Salters. “Shocked. Disappointed. Disgusted. What we heard today called all sideline reporters into question,” Salters said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “My job is an honor, a privilege and a craft at which I have worked so hard… Trust and credibility. They mean everything to a journalist. “To violate either one - in any way - not only makes a mockery of the profession, but is a disservice to players, coaches and, most importantly, to fans.” It was a sentiment shared by The Athletic reporter Chris Kirschner. “A good portion of the public doesn’t trust the media as is,” Kirschner said on X. “I cannot believe she would proudly admit this. This causes significant harm to the people who actually take the job seriously. It’s entirely unethical and worthy of never working in the field again.” CNN has reached out to Fox Sports and Amazon for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication. This isn’t the first time Thompson has admitted to making up a report. In her own “Calm Down” podcast in 2022, Thompson said she “made up a report” when working as a sideline reporter in 2008.",Sports
"‘Our dreams never came true.’ These men helped build Qatar’s World Cup, now they are struggling to survive"," Kamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know. “When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago. Kamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations. It will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights. Kamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work. “I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic. Describing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs. “Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says. “When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.” Using a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response. “When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says. “Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.” Kamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week. Qatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented. He says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided. A Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.” The official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said. With the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy. The Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat. The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN. Hassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context. A government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.” “The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.” It has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered. Eight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population. Since 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found. However, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read. “Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers. “While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.” Last year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made. “I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino. We are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players. Hari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192). After moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits. “It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay. “I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water. “It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.” During his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules. He added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.” Working long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar. In 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months. The government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.” “Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.” Natasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.” “Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains. “As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.” Determining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.” “Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.” According to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states. In its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents. The statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.” Amnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.” Barun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.” Last year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments. “We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour. “Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.” Iskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.” “Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained. “The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.” Knight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?” For the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract. His friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar. Now, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says. Sunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult. He had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.” In helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says. “The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’ “It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?” He says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages. For a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them. “The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.” “I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.” The SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities. Since 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added. Qatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors. The spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid. Such attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status. In Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.” Knight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.” Ghimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.” “Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN. Qatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world. “Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.” Human Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament. Families of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.” Ghimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen. “People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks. “Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know. “Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing? “Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.” Earlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund. A Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year. In terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA. Last month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.” It has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off. FIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers. The motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim. As NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it. “They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed. “They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.” Hosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.",Sports
"She apologized for verbally abusing an Olympic judge, but questions over the conduct of China’s ‘Iron Lady’ of diving remain"," For Lisa Wright, an elite-level diving judge from New Zealand, it was supposed to be the highlight of her career – the chance to adjudicate at the sport’s premier event at the Olympics. But the scenes that unfolded after the men’s 10-meter platform final in Tokyo last year “darkened” her Olympic experience for some time, Wright says. They also led to an official complaint being lodged by Diving New Zealand and Wright against Zhou Jihong – a vice-president of water sports governing body FINA and one of the most influential figures in diving – on the grounds of harassment and abuse. That was after Zhou, who has been dubbed the “Iron Lady” of Chinese diving, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the 10m platform event’s conclusion for underscoring Chinese divers. “She was on poolside screaming at me and yelling at me – it was definitely one of the most humiliating experiences of my life,” Wright tells CNN Sport. Zhou was later ordered by a FINA Ethics Panel to write a letter of apology to Wright. However, some members of the diving community view Zhou’s actions at the Olympics as a flashpoint amid a wider pattern of conduct they believe is harmful to the sport. One of those who holds that belief is New Zealander Simon Latimer, a former diver and judge and now a member of FINA’s Diving Technical Committee (TDC). Following the incident at the Olympics, Latimer sent a whistleblower complaint to FINA’s executive director Brent Nowicki in December detailing Zhou’s alleged “unethical behavior” which he says stretches back several years and “compromises the integrity of both diving and FINA.” This contains allegations that Zhou has routinely coached Chinese divers during major events – including the Tokyo Olympics – and has manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Zhou has not spoken publicly about these allegations. CNN has contacted the General Administration of Sport of China and the Chinese Swimming Association for a response from Zhou but has not received a response. Latimer’s complaint also focused on the events after the men’s 10m platform final last year, an incident he says he witnessed and describes as a “personal outburst” from Zhou towards Wright. “Part of making this complaint is to ensure that an incident like that … never happens again,” Latimer tells CNN Sport. “There’s a lot of things to consider around athlete welfare, but we also need to consider the welfare of officials.” The final concluded with Chinese divers Cao Yuan and Yang Jian winning gold and silver medals respectively and Great Britain’s Tom Daley securing bronze. Wright then approached Zhou to offer her congratulations on China’s success, but says she was met with a barrage of verbal abuse and the allegation that she hadn’t judged to an appropriate standard and had underscored Chinese athletes. “I just said I’m sorry you feel that way and I left and ended up crying in the bathroom, which was definitely not how you want to end your premier event of the Olympics,” says Wright. “It was pretty traumatic for me, to be honest, especially given the fact that everyone knows that she’s the vice president of FINA.” Of some consolation for Wright was the support she received from other diving officials, who she says agreed with how she had scored athletes in the competition. Moreover, the event’s independent assessor – responsible for monitoring the scores given by the judging panel – had agreed with her scoring on two occasions in which she gave a Chinese diver lower scores compared to her peers. In a diving event, judges on the panel award each dive a score ranging from zero to 10. Every FINA event has an assessor who watches replays of the dives, checks for bias in the judging, and evaluates the scores the judges are awarding. Wright says she had no interest in making a “personal complaint” or “retaliation” against Zhou, but was also aware of what might happen if no investigation was launched by diving’s authorities. She believes Zhou would have the power and influence to exclude her from judging panels. “In the end, I think my biggest question was: what am I in this sport for and what am I here for?” Wright says. “I felt that it was important that we do the best thing for the sport of diving, that it remains fair, because that’s what I’m here for as a judge: that I rank those divers in the order that they should be ranked.” In November, the FINA Ethics Panel ordered Zhou to formally apologize to Wright and Diving New Zealand for the incident. Wright says she received the letter of apology, “appreciated” it, but “didn’t feel like it was something personal” given Zhou had been instructed to send it. The panel also ruled that only members of the TDC should be allowed on pool deck during competitions and that Zhou’s Bureau Liaison position – traditionally tasked with taking the views of the TDC back to the FINA bureau – creates “confusion, conflict and discord” and “should be removed.” In his whistleblower complaint, which has been shared with CNN Sport, Latimer alleges that Zhou has provided coaching to Chinese athletes at international diving events – including the FINA World Championships and the Diving World Series, as well as the Olympics – despite her roles requiring neutrality. “It’s absolutely unethical … if you are up coaching divers from your own nation, I don’t see how you could be viewed as a neutral party,” says Latimer. “I also can’t think of any other sport where you would have a vice president on pool deck coaching and having such an open interest in the proceedings.” Since the Olympics, video footage has emerged reportedly showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers at the Games, while another TDC member, Colleen Huffman, says she has witnessed Zhou coaching at other international events. “A lot of times she’s very subtle about it, but obviously at the Olympics she wasn’t subtle at all,” Huffman tells CNN Sport. “For her to have her position and be a coach is a huge conflict of interest. It’s one thing if she helps out at home with the national team, but it’s another thing if she’s actively coaching an athlete at a major FINA event when she’s the Bureau Liaison.” In a statement sent to CNN Sport, TDC member Dominique Philippopoulos said she has twice requested to coach divers from her native South Africa at international events, but on both occasions had her requests denied by FINA officials on the grounds it was a conflict of interest. That’s despite coming from a country where the sport of diving is small and the obstacles are many. According to Philippopoulos, the South African diving federation has limited resources and struggles to finance overseas trips and to cover the cost of coaches. A third allegation made by Latimer in his whistleblower complaint is that Zhou has deliberately manipulated judging panels in an apparent attempt to benefit Chinese divers. “Two judges have confidentially advised me that they believe they are regularly disregarded to judge finals as punishment for not judging Chinese divers as favourably as Zhou Jihong would like,” he wrote. “One judge informed me that Zhou Jihong approached them at a World Cup Event in 2018 and asked ‘why do you not like China?’” According to Latimer, Zhou has “substantial input” when it comes to deciding which judges are chosen to officiate at competitions. He cites his own experience as a judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics, ahead of which he says he had been awarded the highest cumulative evaluation score from assessors among international judges through 2015-2016. But he alleges in his whistleblower complaint that he “fell out of favor” as a judge during the Olympics and was only reinstated for the men’s platform final when members of the TDC Commission “convinced Zhou Jihong” to reappoint him. “What concerns me and some others is that judges appointed to finals aren’t always the ones that appear to be assessed most highly,” says Latimer. “There’s certainly a discrepancy in some judges with very high evaluations getting very few appointments.” Since making his whistleblower complaint, Latimer says he has received a response from FINA saying the governing body won’t look into the issues he raised as they were already considered during the previous complaint submitted by Wright and Diving New Zealand. However, allegations about Zhou manipulating judging panels and coaching during events were not directly mentioned in the Ethics Panel’s response to that initial complaint. These issues, Latimer says, are being “swept under the carpet” by FINA. In a statement sent to CNN, FINA said: “The reports regarding Ms Jihong Zhou were fully investigated by an independent panel that heard from witnesses and reached a decision which is publicly available on the FINA website. “The independent panel concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that competition results were impacted in any way and to our knowledge, no further formal allegations have been made beyond what has been previously decided by the independent panel. “At all times, FINA’s primary concern is the welfare of the aquatics community and ensuring the integrity of our competitions.” Latimer calls the incident between Zhou and Wright at the Olympics a “watershed moment” for him – the moment he decided to support the New Zealand federation’s complaint and then subsequently speak publicly about Zhou’s behavior and his concerns for the integrity of the sport. “I’m well aware that through this whistleblower process, I could lose my position on the Technical Committee,” he says. “We have elections in two months’ time in Budapest [at the World Championships, which start on June 17]. But for me, seeing this complaint through and getting some action is more important than maintaining my position on the committee, although I would obviously like to stay on the committee and be part of the process to ensure this sort of behavior doesn’t continue.” Allegations against Zhou, Latimer says, have been slow to emerge due to her influential status within the sport. The “Iron Lady” of Chinese diving, Zhou became the country’s first ever Olympic gold medalist in the sport in 1984. She went on to spearhead China’s dominance in diving, coaching the national team from 1990 to 1997. Today, as well as being a FINA vice president, she is also the chair of the Chinese Swimming Association. “People are scared stiff, they’re petrified of rocking the boat and losing their position,” Latimer says. Huffman, meanwhile, says she fears for the future of the sport and the potential difficulty of attracting new judges given Zhou’s alleged behavior. “People won’t want to judge. They just won’t,” she adds. “We’re already struggling to get judges, particularly out of the South America region. All the judges from that area are aging out and the new people coming in, they hear bad things about her, how mean she is, how intimidating she is. Who wants to go experience that?” As for Wright, she’s looking forward to her next judging commitments with optimism, undaunted by what happened at the Olympics. She is in line to officiate at the World Championships in June and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, in July. Zhou will likely be at the World Championships, but that doesn’t cause her too much concern. “What’s in the past is in the past,” says Wright. “I really do believe that I choose forgiveness, that I choose to just move on and continue doing what I love.”",Sports
Meet the Black women pushing for equality in swimming," Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers. “There’s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you’ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,” the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport. Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation – a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is “the only sport that can save your life.” The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019. “I used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,” she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters. “There’s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,” Dale adds. She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people – and leaving many more without homes. “There’s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons … who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,” Dale says. “Many people say it’s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they’ve taken time for themselves.” While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England. About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England’s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have “low” or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country’s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming. The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century. Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a “Whites Only” rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women. Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost. Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England – England’s national swimming governing body – and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming. Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO. And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows. “Most drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,” says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021. In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family – a 53-year-old father and his two children – died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning. Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura. “This was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,” Obe says. “(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, ‘We’ve been talking about doing something for our community. We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.’” “It’s no longer just about that lack of representation,” Obe adds. “It’s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.” However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe. “At the moment, we don’t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn’t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.” Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, “implores” people to learn to swim. “I have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who’s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,” she tells CNN Sport. “I take the two of them just as they are – kind of like separate things. I’m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.” At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people – especially Black girls – who wanted to break into the sport. But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming. “Fortunately, for myself, I haven’t come across any barriers at the level I’m at currently,” Dearing says. “But I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don’t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we’re better suited to other sports and so shouldn’t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.” CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data. FINA – the global governing body for swimming – told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level. FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its “Swimming for All, Swimming for Life” program. “FINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,” the organization said to CNN in a statement. “FINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. “Work will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,” FINA added. Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is “committed to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.” “Barriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups – like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,” the statement added. Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than £550 million ($670 million), which they’ve selected “due to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.” “It’s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,” Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call. USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website. “Our goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they’re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,” he added. Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website. From representing their organization at the UK’s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney – one of the most deprived boroughs in London – Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement. “That community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,” says Obe. “Only in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.” In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming. Speaking about the program, Obe says: “It’s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we’re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don’t engage in aquatics, why we don’t see the representation pool side and why we don’t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.” Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming. Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she’s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport. “I really think if anything is going to change, it’s going to be now, it’s going to be over the next couple of years,” she says. “Each story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s just another challenge that we have to face and we’re up for it. “It’s tough – it’s not a quick fix, but the future is bright. “I like to feel that I’m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming. “It’s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it’s really frightening and daunting, but if I’m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.”",Sports
‘I had PTSD’: Culture of abuse in British gymnastics leaves lasting legacy on its victims," For Claire Heafford, the abuse she says she suffered as a young gymnast has left a lasting mark on her life. Heafford, who’s now in her 40s, told CNN Sport she experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after competing in British gymnastics in the 1990s, when she alleges, she was physically and emotionally abused. Now, she says she finally feels “vindicated,” after years fighting for reform in the sport through the organization she co-founded, Gymnasts for Change. Last week, an independent review concluded that British Gymnastics allowed for a culture of physical and emotional abuse and failed to provide a safe environment for gymnasts, with children body-shamed, belittled and abused. Heafford said she felt “a massive feeling of vindication” following the release of a review conducted by barrister Anne Whyte, saying it “completely validated everything that we’d anecdotally known and had been reporting and campaigning on for two years.” Released Thursday, Whyte’s 300-plus page review concluded that British Gymnastics should have been aware of the “bullying, harassment and excessive control” that occurred in training clubs between 2008 and 2020. “My own experience was that I was trained by the first Russian that was brought over to the UK in the 90s,” Heafford told CNN’s Amanda Davies. “I grew up in a Soviet training camp in the heart of the home counties [the counties surrounding London]. It was too bizarre to be believed. So as a kid just at an ordinary state school, trying to explain to my school friends, what my training life was like was difficult,” she said. In the report, Whyte highlighted the “recruitment of a significant number of coaches” from the former Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc. “The technical skill and experience of these coaches, whilst formidable, was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities,” Whyte wrote, adding that the ability of these coaches to produce decorated gymnasts was admired and later emulated by coaches in the UK. Heafford says what she experienced in the 1990s mirrors incidents reported to Whyte, who was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England to review allegations that British Gymnastics failed to address complaints for decades. Whyte received over 400 submissions and interviewed 190 people after her call for evidence in August 2020. In response to the review, British Gymnastics chief executive Sarah Powell admitted Thursday that the organization failed the sport of gymnastics and apologized on behalf of the sporting body. “I wish to accept all of the recommendations and the key findings, and we will work hard to ensure that these are acted upon quickly and robustly,” stated Powell. “But most importantly, I want to wholeheartedly apologize on behalf of the leadership and the board for those gymnasts who have suffered because we have not met the standards that are expected for our sport.” “When you do try to raise the alarm as a child and you’re shut down, it makes you think that if you do speak out, you’re not going to be believed,” Heafford, who left the sport in 1995, told CNN. “From that point on, I never watched gymnastics. I got the hell away from it. And I went into athletics, which is where I had wonderful experiences, and I loved every minute of being a track and field athlete. So it was only when I stopped competing that I started to get PTSD symptoms showing up from my time in gymnastics,” she added. After distancing herself from the sport for years, Heafford now coaches adults in gymnastics, runs body positive gymnastics classes and campaigns for change in the sport – particularly for the recognition of historic abuse. Other gymnasts have been vocal in their support of the report’s release. Two-time Olympian Becky Downie, who competed for Great Britain in the 2008 and 2016 Olympic Games, said the report “feels like a vindication for myself and so many who have known for so long of the serious cultural problems within the sport. A sport I love more than anything.” “Finally everyone knows the truth and while it won’t directly benefit those who have experienced it, it’s encouraging to know that if the recommendations are implemented, it’ll protect and enhance the next generation of gymnasts,” she wrote on Instagram and Twitter. Whyte recommended systemic changes in her review, including calling on British Gymnastics to improve its complaints system by offering better guidance on how concerns should be investigated and strengthening how complaints are monitored so that patterns of abuse can be better recognized. Whyte also recommended that British Gymnastics reassess the level of responsibility delegated to volunteers and employ trained, expert staff, as well as introducing mandatory safeguarding training for all club owners and managers. She added that British Gymnastics must appoint board members with expertise in promoting the welfare of children and protecting them from harm, as well as a director of education with responsibility for the education of coaches and welfare officers. Downie added: “While it’ll never make what has been allowed to happen to myself and so many others ok, it has been made clear us athletes have been heard, and I’m overwhelmingly encouraged for the future of young gymnasts in this country.” UK Sport and Sport England said they accepted and endorsed the review’s recommendations, and that they would continue to support British Gymnastics. “At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now,” the joint UK Sport and Sport England statement reads. “However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report’s recommendations.” This week, 18-year-old former elite acrobatic gymnast Eloise Jotischky won the first civil case against British Gymnastics for the abuse she said she experienced at the hands of a coach. She and Heafford are among a group of 39 plaintiffs involved in civil cases focusing on historic abuse by coaches who fell under the auspices of British Gymnastics, according to a representative for Gymnastics for Change. British Gymnastics admitted full liability in Jotischky’s case and reached a settlement with the former gymnast, whom the BBC reported also received an apology from the chief executive of the organization. Jotischky, who said her coach subjected her to inappropriate weight management techniques and verbal harassment, told CNN Sport in an email she was glad the report had “finally exposed the catastrophic safeguarding failures that led to the abuse of hundreds of gymnasts.” In the report, Whyte highlighted submissions detailing how “some coaches went to damaging lengths to control what gymnasts ate and weighed, to the extent of searching luggage and rooms for food. As a result, some gymnasts suffered from (and still suffer from) eating disorders and associated mental health issues.” Jotischky, who competed in the sport between the ages of eight and 14, told CNN Sport she was encouraged that British Gymnastics intended to implement the report’s recommendations. But she expressed concern, saying that “more needs to be done to address and reform the endemic culture of abuse that has been so deeply ingrained within the sport.” In particular, Jotischky said she believes a register of coaches is critical: “Without a register of coaches, parents will never know when their child is being coached by someone who has had allegations of abuse against them. The failures of the past have proved that parents should not be shut out, especially in a sport where the coaches are being entrusted with the welfare of young children.” When approached for a comment on Jotischky’s remarks, British Gymnastics declined to comment further. Jotischky said that, since becoming the first gymnast to win her legal case against British Gymnastics, she has been overwhelmed by the number of gymnasts who have contacted her to share their experiences. “It shows there are so many gymnasts who are afraid to speak out publicly and that must change,” she said. Heafford agreed. “The reality is that national governing bodies operate within a vacuum from a legal point of view. And the only thing that will bring actual cultural change to sport generally and specifically to the sport of gymnastics is legislative change,” she said, adding that she is calling for mandatory reporting whereby parents, gymnasts and coaches within training facilities would legally be required to report any abuse they observed. Heafford said that it was difficult for survivors to speak up, adding “there is such defensiveness within the culture of gymnastics.” “You know that as a gymnast, if you speak out about culture, there will be repercussions. You’ll be ostracized from the community, so it’s not an easy thing to do,” she said. UK Sport and Sport England referred CNN to last week’s joint statement when approached for further comment. The report comes as gymnastics institutions worldwide have been forced to reckon with claims of abuse and safeguarding failures following an outpouring of survivor testimony. In March, more than 70 former and current gymnasts in Canada called for an investigation into “ongoing toxic and abusive practices” gymnasts are allegedly subject to in the country. In an open letter addressed to Sport Canada, the athletes have called for the governing body to conduct an “independent, third-party investigation.” At the time, GymCan said it was aware of the letter being circulated and agreed that an external and independent organization must be established to oversee complaints. In May, GymCan and its Provincial Member Organizations said they had been informed by the media of a proposed class action lawsuit, filed with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in which they are named as defendants. “Although we have not been served, the allegations we have been made aware of in the claim describe behaviour that is unacceptable in any sport environment, and we take them very seriously,” GymCan said in a statement, adding they are committed to addressing all allegations with “diligence and due process.” This comes four years after disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct. At the sentencing, 156 victims, including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, recounted stories of how they went to Nassar to receive treatment for sports injuries, only to be sexually assaulted and told it was a form of treatment. Attorneys for more than 90 women and girls who were sexually abused by Nassar this month submitted claims for over $1 billion to the FBI, saying investigators could have ended Nassar’s predation and protected other victims had they not mishandled the case.

Disruptive Thanksgiving-week storm affecting much of the East as holiday travel rush begins," A storm system pushing across the eastern US ahead of Thanksgiving is delivering widespread impacts on Tuesday, threatening to disrupt holiday travel with severe thunderstorms, drenching rain and snow. Live Updates: See the latest on delays and disruptions as Thanksgiving travel gets underway At least two dozen states across the East, including major travel hubs from Atlanta to New York City, will contend with adverse weather during two of the busiest travel days of the year. The conditions may cause travel headaches during what is expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period in years, leading to disruptions at airports in large hubs such as Atlanta, New York City, Boston and Washington, DC. But there is still room for optimism. The storm’s impacts are forecast to subside Wednesday as it tracks off the East Coast, leaving much of the central and eastern US to enjoy a dry Thanksgiving day. Track the storm with more maps here. Rain will be heavy at times from southern Alabama to New York as the wide-reaching storm tracks east and expands to the north throughout Tuesday. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible. Some areas, including Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains, could receive over 4 inches. The risk for severe thunderstorms will shift east Tuesday evening and encompass portions of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia into early Wednesday morning. Damaging wind gusts are the main concern, but a brief tornado cannot be ruled out. The storm is also worsening fire weather in the drought- and wildfire-plagued Appalachians. Winds from the storm increased late Monday in the region and prevented steady, beneficial rain from reaching the ground. This caused one fire to flare up and force evacuations in a remote area of Tennessee near Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow will spread across northern New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening. This same wintry mix already  made some roadways slick across portions of Pennsylvania and southern New York early Tuesday. High-elevation areas of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains are most likely to see accumulating snow Tuesday night. As the sun rises in the northeast Wednesday, roads may be slick or snowy in parts of Vermont, New York and New Hampshire due to overnight snowfall. Steady rain and breezy conditions will linger early Wednesday morning across the greater New York City metro but the storm’s impact will taper off significantly by mid-morning as it moves off the East Coast, dumping its final remnants on parts of New England. Snow will accumulate in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire. Thanksgiving Day will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. A storm will begin to build over the northern Rockies on Thursday and strengthen on Friday bringing snow to portions of the Rockies, including Denver and Salt Lake City.

"Several tornadoes reported as dangerous storms fire up, threatening 20 million from Texas to the Southeast"," Dangerous thunderstorms rumbled to life across parts of the South on Monday as more than 20 million people from eastern Texas to the Southeast faced a threat of damaging winds, hail and potentially strong tornadoes. The severe thunderstorms moved across eastern Texas and the Mississippi Valley, bringing at least six reports of high winds, including gusts in Copiah County, Mississippi, estimated at more than 60 mph. “A storm system will move from the southern Plains to the Northeast U.S. through Wednesday with severe thunderstorms for the northern Gulf states, gusty winds and heavy rain for the Southeast, and a wintry mix for the interior Northeast,” the National Weather Service said. Tornado watches were in effect Monday night for more than 2.5 million people – mostly in Mississippi – as dangerous storms sprung to life. There were four reports of tornadoes in the state as of 8:15 p.m. CT, following one reported twister earlier in neighboring Louisiana. An enhanced risk level for severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, was in effect Monday night for parts of eastern Louisiana and central Mississippi, including Hattiesburg, Mississippi, the Storm Prediction Center said. The greatest risk for strong tornadoes that could deliver wind speeds over 111 mph – EF2-strength or stronger – remained possible across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley, the center said. Level 1 and 2 severe threats were in place from Texas to Alabama and Arkansas, including Houston and Little Rock, Arkansas. Tornado warnings hadn’t been issued across much of the Southeast since late June, but that changed Monday afternoon. November marks the start of a secondary severe weather season in the region. The clash of cold, Canadian air drilling into the South and lingering warm, moist air over the Gulf of Mexico typically leads to an uptick in damaging thunderstorms from November to December. The storms may bring a brief reprieve to drought-stricken Louisiana and Mississippi, which could see excessive rainfall of up to 2 inches on Monday, and as many as 3 inches in some areas, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Louisiana is suffering through its worst drought on record – one that’s fed unprecedented wildfires and contributed to the potentially catastrophic intrusion of saltwater into the Mississippi River. Exceptional drought – the US Drought Monitor’s most extreme category – now covers nearly three-quarters of the state, according to data released last week. In neighboring Mississippi, exceptional drought has spread over more than half of the state. The same storm delivering severe thunderstorms to the South blew through the Rockies over the weekend, leaving heavy mountain snowfall piled nearly a foot high in several parts of Utah, Nevada and Colorado, preliminary snow reports show. Parts of Utah saw a foot or more of snow, followed closely by some cities in Nevada. Here are some of the latest preliminary snowfall totals reported by the National Weather Service: Lower elevations were still warm enough to receive rainfall, with storm totals of 1 to 3 inches reported and isolated totals exceeding 3 inches. High wind gusts also swept the region, with a gust of 144 mph reported in Mammoth, California, which has an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet.",Weather
"Significant Thanksgiving-week storm will disrupt travel with rain, snow and severe storms"," A significant storm will deal a blow to Thanksgiving travel this week, with rain, snow and even severe thunderstorms set to impact a large portion of the US. This week is expected to be the busiest in years on the roads and airports could set new records – meaning this week’s headache-inducing weather could not come at a worse time. The havoc-wreaking system will track from the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley on Monday and spread rain across much of the central US. Fortunately for any early week travelers, this rain is not expected to be heavy in most areas. But a different threat has emerged and could snarl travel for portions of the Gulf Coast late Monday afternoon as the storm moves east: severe thunderstorms, including possible tornadoes. Severe weather, while more common in the spring, can happen any time of the year if there’s enough warmth and moisture in the air. Damaging thunderstorms fired up Monday afternoon in east Texas, where the atmosphere is primed with plenty of moisture and warmth. These storms will track across Louisiana, Arkansas and push into Mississippi from Monday evening into early Tuesday morning. Damaging winds and hail are likely within any of Monday’s severe thunderstorms. Several tornadoes are also possible, especially across Louisiana and Mississippi. A fresh input of atmospheric energy and a robust surge of moisture will charge up the storm’s impacts Tuesday and usher in the most widespread, impactful weather of the week. The issues will start early Tuesday morning in the Southeast, where the severe thunderstorm threat will be highest in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Storms could unload damaging wind gusts and perhaps a tornado. Rain will expand east throughout Tuesday and spread into parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, where it will fall heavily at times. This heavy rainfall is unlikely to result in widespread flooding, but may pond on some roadways or in low-lying areas. Breezy conditions will develop across the East on Tuesday, especially in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The combination of gusty winds and drenching rain may lead to disruptions in airport operations for large hubs in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Wintry weather will present another challenge for holiday travelers in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday. Rain will mix with sleet and snow when precipitation begins across the elevated terrain of Pennsylvania Tuesday morning and southern New York by Tuesday afternoon. This wintry mix will expand into parts of Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening and turn mostly to snow in some areas Tuesday night. Accumulating snow Tuesday night will largely be confined to the highest elevations of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains. Weather travel disruptions may not be as widespread on Wednesday as the storm slowly tracks off the East Coast and inland impacts start to diminish. Roadways may be slick or snow-covered in parts of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Wednesday morning following Tuesday night’s wintry weather. More accumulating snow will arrive in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire. Rain will taper off throughout the day across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and much of New York, but will persist across the Carolinas and parts of the Southeast. For travelers across the West, the weather will be perfect for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday with high pressure in control across almost the entire region. Thanksgiving will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. However, this influx of cold air will cause lake-effect snow showers to develop downwind of the Great Lakes. Dry weather is expected for the annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City on Thursday morning, but some breezy conditions may persist. The parade’s famous balloons are typically flown closer to the ground on a breezy day and higher off the ground on a calm day. Elsewhere, a few rain showers may push across coastal Texas while in the West some mountain snow could bring fresh powder to high elevations in the northern Rockies. Weather conditions will generally be calmer for travelers across the eastern half of the US heading home after Thanksgiving festivities on Friday, but the weekend may not be dry. Another storm may develop and move off the East Coast over the weekend. Rain and potential wintry weather is possible across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. It’s still too early to know exactly how, or even if, this storm develops, but details will come into focus by midweek. Travelers in the West should be treated another stretch of favorable conditions as high pressure remains in place.",Weather
Snow and rain to bring weather woes to millions of Thanksgiving travelers," Multiple storm systems could impact Thanksgiving travelers. Two separate systems will impact holiday travelers Saturday – one in New England and the other along the West Coast – both bringing rain and snow and the possibility of travel delays. The system in the East will push rain and gusty winds into coastal New England and some snow showers across the White and Green Mountains. If you have travel flexibility, and are driving instead of flying, it may be best to wait until Sunday for most of New England. Travelers in and out of Boston will likely encounter rain showers, patchy fog and wind gusts up to 30 mph Saturday. By Sunday, the sunshine will return and winds will decrease to 10 to 20 mph. The West Coast system will begin Saturday in the Portland, Oregon, area and will stretch down through San Diego. Rain will also spread into desert cities, including Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque – and will continue Sunday from Seattle down through Eureka, California. More than 6 million people from Southern California to southern Idaho are under wind advisories through Sunday. Winds could reach 40 to 50 mph with gusts as high as 60 mph in the mountains. “Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles and motorcycles,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said. “Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may result.” Sunday also will see a shift eastward for this system into the Mountain West and Central Plains. Rain, and snow for higher elevations, will stretch from Washington to Colorado. Salt Lake City will see rain showers to start, but as temperatures drop Sunday evening, it will gradually change over to a mix of rain and snow. The focus across the Central Plains will be rain and thunderstorms from Nebraska down through Texas. By Monday, a new threat begins across the Gulf Coast with the possibility for tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds. As this low pressure system deepens and advances eastward, it will also spread rain from Minnesota through Louisiana. Rain chances increase through the day Monday in Shreveport, with thunderstorms developing in the late afternoon and continuing through the evening. The day with the most weather-related headaches for travelers is likely to be Tuesday, with th﻿e low pressure system bringing rain and thunderstorms to the majority of the eastern half of the country. The area looking at possible rain includes major airport cities – New York, Washington, Chicago, and Atlanta. All could see delays and frustrations from the wet forecast. Atlanta could see over an inch of rain in less than 24 hours Tuesday, and winds could gust up to or over 30 mph all day, even though the thunderstorms will be mostly confined to the afternoon.",Weather
Atlantic hurricane season isn’t over yet as trouble looms in the Caribbean," The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season technically comes to a close in two weeks, but parts of the Atlantic Ocean are still churning. A potential tropical cyclone spun to life on Thursday afternoon and is expected to become a tropical storm on Friday in the Caribbean Sea – the area forecasters marked as the zone to watch in November. This new potential tropical cyclone – a system that has yet to meet the criteria for a tropical depression or storm, but still poses danger to land – was just east of Honduras and Nicaragua on Thursday. It’s forecast to become a tropical depression by Thursday night and a tropical storm by Friday afternoon. Once this system strengthens into a tropical storm, it will be given the penultimate name of the 2023 hurricane season’s list: Vince. Tropical storm watches were issued Thursday afternoon for Jamaica, Haiti, portions of Cuba, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Regardless of how strong the system becomes, its heavy rainfall will drench Jamaica and portions of Cuba and Haiti Thursday night through Saturday, and dangerous flash flooding and mudslides are possible in the most torrential rain. Portions of the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos are also in for a soaking on Saturday as tropical moisture fuels storminess across the area. The potential storm was thwarted earlier this week by a few environmental factors. In order to develop and strengthen, a tropical system needs warm water, low wind shear and plenty of moisture. However, not all of these were in place across the Caribbean Sea this week. Sea surface temperatures remain plenty warm to support tropical development, but wind shear emerged as a limiting factor. Wind shear can tear a storm’s circulation apart or prevent one from forming altogether. But once wind shear backs off, it leaves the door wide open for tropical development, and wind shear over the Caribbean eased slightly late Wednesday into Thursday and will remain generally low into the weekend. Farther north, tropical development is possible but unlikely from an area of thunderstorms off the Southeast coast. This area of stormy weather unloaded torrential rainfall over South Florida on Wednesday. The more likely scenario is that a non-tropical storm develops and moves up the East Coast over the weekend. In this scenario, rough seas and breezy conditions are possible along the Southeast coast this weekend. Despite being late in the season, tropical storms and even hurricanes do form in November.

2023 Atlantic Hurricane Season Fast Facts," Here is a look at the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. Past coverage of the 2022 and 2021 hurricane season and the latest weather news can also be found on CNN. Follow the storm tracker for the path and forecasts of the latest storm. The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. The areas covered include the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as a “tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.” Hurricanes are rated according to intensity of sustained winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage. A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane. The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness: April 13, 2023 - The Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project team predicts a “slightly below-normal” Atlantic hurricane season. The team forecasts 13 named storms, including six hurricanes, two of which will be major hurricanes. May 25, 2023 - The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 40% chance for a near-normal season, predicting that there is a 70% chance of having 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to nine could develop into hurricanes, including one to four major hurricanes (Categories 3-5). August 10, 2023 - NOAA releases its updated forecast, upping the odds for an above average hurricane season from 30% to 60% as ocean temperatures continue to climb above record levels this summer. The agency now predicts 14-21 named storms, including six to 11 hurricanes, of which two to five are forecast to be major. These ranges take into account the named storms that have already formed this season.

Thousands without power after heavy rain and high winds lash South Florida metro areas," Torrential rain and powerful winds knocked out power across South Florida metro areas and prompted school closures on Thursday. Overnight flash flood warnings expired early Thursday, but South Florida could see periodic light rainfall through the day, particularly along the East Coast. Flood watches that affected millions across southeastern Florida have ended but a watch remained in place for nearly 1.5 million people along eastern Florida through the evening. High wind alerts are also in place across southern and eastern Florida, with 60 mph gusts expected in some areas. As of around 7 a.m. Thursday, more than 125,000 homes and businesses were without power in Florida, with Miami-Dade County accounting for more than half of those outages, according to outage tracking website Poweroutage.us. Even though the heaviest rainfall moved off the southeastern coast of Florida Thursday morning rain was still impacting areas where the soil is already saturated. “Drainage will be difficult in many coastal areas due (to) the high tide. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,” the weather service in Miami warned. The torrential rainfall comes just months after a 1-in-1,000-year rain event led to the rainiest day on record in Fort Lauderdale, when 22.5 inches fell on April 12, submerging roads and neighborhoods and forcing the airport to close. Southeast Florida took the brunt of the blow, with rainfall totals approaching double digits. Areas around Fort Lauderdale, Miami and southwest into the Florida Keys had widespread 48-hour rainfall totals of 6 to 9 inches. By Wednesday night, Miami was drenched with 6.73 inches of rain within the previous 24 hours, while Hollywood received 5.62 inches and Fort Lauderdale saw 4.2 inches of rainfall during roughly the same time period, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service. Broward County Public Schools canceled classes and closed administrative offices Thursday due to safety concerns, the district said on its website. Broward College in Fort Lauderdale will close Thursday for the second day in a row due to flooding in surrounding areas, the school said online. Meanwhile in Lauderdale Lakes, located in Broward County, wind gusts toppled over a tree and destroyed two cars, CNN affiliate WSVN reported Wednesday. Spiro Marchelos, the owner of Anglers Beach Cafe, gave his employees the day off due to the conditions. “It’s a loss of revenue, but we have no choice,” he told the outlet. “The weather is bad, and people aren’t going to come to the beach today. It’s windy, rainy, and the streets are flooded.” There is a slight risk for excessive rainfall, level 2 of 4, along the eastern coast of Florida on Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. A marginal risk for excessive rainfall, level 1 of 4, is in place over southeastern Florida through Thursday. That’s combined with a high wind warning in effect for coastal areas in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties through 1 p.m. Thursday. Winds may gust up to 60 mph, heightening the threat of widespread power outages. Portions of Palm Beach County and Broward County – where Fort Lauderdale is located – saw 3 to 6 inches of rain on Tuesday and stand to get an additional 8 to 10 inches through Thursday. Three-day rainfall totals in excess of a foot are not out of the question in these areas. Fort Lauderdale has already had an abnormally wet year, and this week’s rain will likely be enough to push the city into record territory. As of Wednesday morning, the city had recorded 100 inches of rain this year, just shy of its wettest year on record – 102.36 inches in 1947. And now Greg Brandenburg of Fort Lauderdale is bracing for the worst. “It’s just so much rain that we’ve had this year, it’s crazy,” he told WSVN. “Now we got this rain situation coming back again. It’s just tiring.” The torrential rainfall rates and accumulation totals through Thursday across southeastern Florida will lead to “a higher probability of flash flooding concerns within the urban corridor down into the Florida Keys north of Marathon,” according to the Weather Prediction Center. Saturated ground and ongoing king tides could slow the water from receding in coastal communities that flood this week. On April 12, Fort Lauderdale experienced the rainiest day in its history, sparking a flash flood emergency in Broward County that prompted emergency rescues, forced drivers to abandon cars, shuttered schools and shut down the airport. During the peak of the deluge, a month’s worth of rain fell in just one hour. Extreme rainfall is a signature consequence of a warming climate, and it is happening more frequently. The deluge in South Florida was the latest instance after 1-in-1000 year rains also struck in areas including Dallas, St. Louis, eastern Kentucky and Yellowstone.

"Microplastics could trigger cloud formation and affect the weather, new study suggests"," Microplastics are turning up in unusual places increasingly often as they filter into nearly every facet of life on Earth. They’ve been discovered in drinking water, food, air and even in blood. Now, scientists have found that these tiny particles might even be able to influence the weather. Researchers reported Wednesday they detected microplastics in a majority of cloud samples taken from a mountaintop in China, in a study published in the American Chemical Society’s Environmental Science & Technology Letters. The study traced how the microplastics ended up at their final location and discovered that they could play a role in cloud formation. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic that are no larger than five millimeters, which is about the size of a single sesame seed. And they are everywhere, according to Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, a group working to end plastic pollution. “Microplastics are in the air we breathe, they’re in our drinking water, they’re in our bodies,” Enck told CNN. Microplastics form when larger plastics break down, either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. “If it’s plastic, you’re going to get microplastics sooner or later,” Enck said. The smaller a microplastic is, the easier it can move through environmental cycles – like the water cycle – and ultimately end up in the human body, where its effects are worrisome but still unclear. Most experts believe more research is needed to determine the full impact of microplastics on human health, but studies have shown that there are already some demonstrable adverse health impacts. The authors of Wednesday’s study found microplastics affect cloud formation, and clouds are of huge importance to the weather we experience. Clouds produce precipitation in the form of rain, snow and everything in between. They also block sunlight, and less solar radiation means cooler temperatures. In order for a cloud to form, water vapor – a gas – needs to turn into water droplets – a liquid. Then, many water droplets need to come together to become a cloud. Water droplets form when water vapor interacts with tiny solid particles in the atmosphere, like dust, ash or salt from the ocean. According to the study, microplastics can now be added to that list. These particles are hydrophilic, which means they are attracted to water. Once the first water droplets cling to microplastics and other tiny particles, more water droplets are pulled together and clouds form. The process is akin to how a single spark can eventually set an entire field ablaze: One tiny particle in the atmosphere can set into motion a process that becomes something much bigger. According to the study’s authors, further research must be completed to fully understand the extent to which microplastics influence cloud formation. Could a greater concentration of microplastics lead to more clouds? Will an increase in clouds lead to more precipitation or larger swaths of cooler conditions? These questions remain unanswered. Microplastics are tiny and light enough to get picked up by the wind and hoisted into the atmosphere. The study’s authors found samples of microplastics in the air over Mount Tai in China, and developed computer models to recreate the journey those particles would have had to take to end up there. The models suggested that the flow of air from nearby highly populated inland Chinese cities served as a major source of the microplastics. This suggests microplastics produced at ground level were lofted and carried large distances. There are more microplastics found in cities than rural areas, in general, since a higher population density often leads to a higher demand for plastic products. However, rural areas are quickly catching up with microplastic production, according to Enck.",Weather
Drenching rain on its way to quench Louisiana’s worst drought on record," The Gulf Coast’s most significant rainfall in months will bring much-needed relief this week to portions of the Gulf Coast, helping to alleviate Louisiana’s worst drought on record – one that’s fueled unprecedented wildfires and helped trigger an alarming saltwater intrusion into the Mississippi River. Exceptional drought – the US Drought Monitor’s most extreme category – is entrenched across 73% of Louisiana, according to data released Thursday. It’s the largest area of exceptional drought on record in the state. Exceptional drought has also spread across nearly half of Mississippi and a portion of eastern Texas. A significant rainfall deficit resulting from an incredibly hot and dry summer is to blame for these expansive areas of drought along the Gulf Coast, but multiple days of rain this week will help the region make up some crucial ground. Widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected across southern Louisiana, mainly south of Interstate 10, from Monday to Wednesday. Higher amounts are possible along the coastline, where up to 5 inches could fall in some locations. “Any kind of rainfall we can get, especially when it’s widespread like this, is very beneficial to the area,” said Doug Cramer, a warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Showers and areas of steady rain spread across parts of the Texas and Louisiana early Monday as a slow-moving storm churns just off the coast. Rainfall will expand in scope and become steadier across Louisiana by late Monday and continue through at least Wednesday morning as the storm moves slowly over the northern Gulf of Mexico. The rainfall is unlikely to cause significant flooding, but the stormy weather will lead to choppy seas and coastal flooding at high tide. By Wednesday, rain will expand farther eastward to drench portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Whether the rainfall will make enough of a dent in Louisiana’s exceptional drought to warrant a downgrade in drought intensity remains to be seen. “It’s possible,” Cramer told CNN, noting it is difficult to say with any certainty whether drought categories will change until a rainfall analysis begins after the event concludes. “It does appear as though [Louisiana] is going to continue to see rain chances over the next couple of weeks, so that’s good news,” Cramer added. Year-to-date, parts of Louisiana have had less than half of the rainfall typically recorded at this point in the year. As of Sunday, only 27 inches of rain had fallen in New Orleans – the second-driest year-to-date the city has ever reported by early November. New Orleans typically receives close to 56 inches of rain by early November. In the long term, Cramer pointed to El Niño as further good news for drought reduction. “El Niño is typically wet along the Gulf Coast over the winter time, so we’re optimistic we can start to move the needle on this.” CNN’s Robert Shackelford contributed to this story.",Weather
First atmospheric river storm of the season targets California next week," A major pattern change is set to deliver California’s first atmospheric river of the season next week. Significant rain and snow is in the forecast for the Golden State, while damp, dreary days are ahead for other parts of the West as signs of El Niño’s influence on the upcoming winter season emerge. November got off to a wet start across the Pacific Northwest, but the rainy weather didn’t make it south into much of California. Two things will bring a dramatic change to that trend next week: a southward dip in the jet stream – the river of fast-moving air that carries storms around the planet – will be pointed directly at California; and a large area of disruptive atmospheric energy will linger just off the West Coast. Next week’s storms will be fueled in part by an atmospheric river – the region’s hallmark type of winter storm, which transports abundant moisture from the tropical Pacific straight to the West Coast. The West was drenched by many of these systems last winter: California alone saw at least a dozen significant atmospheric rivers, which claimed at least 18 lives and dealt tremendous damage to infrastructure. But they also brought much-needed rain and snow to a region that desperately needed it, filling reservoirs and allowing water officials to take stock and prepare for a future with less freshwater. Atmospheric rivers are categorized on a five-point scale, with 1 describing “weak” storms and 5 classified as “exceptional.” Next week’s event is shaping up to be at least a Level 2 of 5 – in other words, a “moderate” atmospheric river. Rain will push into Northern California as early as Monday, spreading to parts of Central California on Tuesday. The timing for rain in Southern California depends strongly on the exact evolution of the storm early next week, but wet weather will likely commence by late Wednesday or Thursday. Once rain begins, it will continue at varying intensity for much of the week and into the weekend for some areas. Rainfall amounts are not expected to reach catastrophic levels that would trigger widespread flooding, but many locations could receive more than a month’s worth in a matter of days. Any rain that falls will be notable – California hasn’t experienced multiple days of rain since the summer, and many locations are in a rainfall deficit compared to average. From September 1 to November 9, San Francisco and Los Angeles have each only recorded about 6% of the average rainfall for the period. Despite this rainfall deficit, California is drought-free for the first time in nearly four years: the state reported no areas of drought in mid-October, which was the first such reading since January 2020. Rain isn’t the only concern next week – the stormy setup is primed to deliver significant snow to the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Multiple feet of snow could fall in the highest elevations of the Sierra, with up to a foot in some foothills by next weekend. The elevation where rain will change to snow will start out quite high next week, but snow will likely begin to pile up in the lower elevations of the mountains in earnest late-week as colder air is pulled across the region. Elsewhere across the West, there will be no discernible break from the dreariness with the new influx of wet weather next week, and the Northwest will remain wet both this weekend and next week as moisture continues to funnel across the region. Like many other elements of the upcoming winter – including temperature and snow – studies have shown that El Niño influences the behavior of atmospheric rivers. A 2017 study found atmospheric rivers are more likely to impact the western US during El Niño, when ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific are abnormally high. Not only can El Niño affect where atmospheric rivers dump the most precipitation, its strength can also affect how often they occur. A study published in January found the frequency of atmospheric rivers increased during strong El Niño years – the level expected this winter. Like any weather phenomenon, atmospheric rivers aren’t dependent on just one variable. So, having a strong El Niño in place doesn’t necessarily guarantee a higher frequency of atmospheric river events. For example, the 2017 study also found that atmospheric rivers are less likely to impact the western US during La Niña. But La Niña was firmly in place last winter when California was slammed by a dozen of the potent storms.",Weather
New maps reveal who could see more snow this winter during a strong El Niño," As the US gears up for a winter heavily influenced by the first strong El Niño in years, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have released maps that offer insight into where snow could pile up. El Niño – a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – is forecast to reach the most significant level since a very strong El Niño in 2015-2016 fostered the warmest winter on record across the contiguous US, according to NOAA. While no two El Niño winters are the same, the pattern typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the southern US while the north becomes drier and warmer. And that’s exactly what’s expected this winter. However, wetter weather doesn’t necessarily mean more snow. And when it does snow, amounts can vary wildly from one location to the next. Read More: Forecasters predict a classic El Niño winter this year This is where the new maps come in. They show where snow is more or less likely during El Niño winters compared to average. There’s just one caveat: these maps are historical guidebooks, not forecasts, for how the season’s snow could play out. An actual snowfall forecast would account for a variety of atmospheric and climatological factors, not just El Niño. “El Niño nudges the odds in favor of certain climate outcomes, but never ensures them,” Michelle L’Heureux, one of the two scientists behind the new maps, explained in a NOAA blog post. The map above depicts how much snow differs from average across all El Niño winters, regardless of El Niño’s strength. The drier trend that’s typical across the northern US shows up well in the tan and brown shading, while the wetter, snowier trend across the southern US appears in the blue shading. This pattern comes from the jet stream’s shift south, pushing storms across the southern tier of the country at the expense of the north. And an increase in storms during the winter means snow is more likely. The stronger an El Niño is, the more amplified its impact becomes. The map below shows the same data for stronger El Niño winters. The pronounced darker hues represent more extreme shifts in snowfall during a strong El Niño compared to an average one. The big snow winners are the mid-Atlantic, the high elevations of the Southwest and California, and the South, albeit with an important caveat. It still needs to be cold in order to snow, so chances don’t vary as much from normal in portions of Texas and the Southeast, which tend to remain too warm for flakes to fly. El Niño’s jet stream effect is particularly noticeable in the highest terrain of the West, where cold and snow isn’t usually hard to come by. Mountains in the Southwest and California thrive while the Northwest misses out because of fewer storms. Storms that affect the mid-Atlantic’s snow chances typically take a track along the spine of the Appalachians or push off the coast and become nor’easters. These nor’easters can get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture during El Niño and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. This could bring above-average snowfall to places like Washington, DC, and Baltimore, where less than an inch fell last winter. Even though the Northeast typically misses out on snow during a strong El Niño winter, all it takes is one massive storm, like a “juiced up” nor’easter, to skew snow totals for the whole season. Snow lovers in the Northwest and Midwest will also have to join their Northeast counterparts in hoping for a big storm. Stronger El Niños have caused less snow than average in the past. Removing snowfall totals from the map and focusing on the number of stronger El Niños with below-average snowfall helps suss out outlier storms. On the map above, darker reds indicate areas that have experienced more years of below-average snowfall during moderate-to-strong El Niño winters. Parts of the typically snowy Midwest and Northeast which also suffer from snowfall deficits jump out clearly, a sign that this may be where El Niño steals the most snow, most often.",Weather
"Storm Ciarán batters Northwest Europe, killing at least 4 people and cutting 1 million off power grids"," ﻿Storm Ciarán has brought hurricane-strength winds to France, the Channel Islands and southern England, leaving more than a million people without access to electricity and forcing hundreds of schools to close. The storm has claimed at least four lives, two in France and a further two in Belgium. In France, 1.2 million people were left without power as winds of over 120 kph (75 mph), and gusts of more than 200 kph (124 mph) hit the department of Finistère in the northwest, according to the country’s meteorological agency Meteo-France. The wind speeds broke several local records. “The very violent winds and gusts which followed one another throughout the night had the effect of causing many trees, branches and electrical and telephone lines across the entire road network to fall to the ground,” a statement from the Finistère government said. Around 780,000 of those without power are in the northwestern region of Brittany, French energy supplier Enedis said in a statement. Fallen trees and electricity pylons uprooted by the storm were to blame for the cuts. Enedis has mobilized around 3,000 workers and 30 helicopters to re-establish power to affected areas. A truck driver was killed after being hit by a falling branch while driving, according to the French Transport Minister Clément Beaune in an interview with French broadcaster Franceinfo. The second victim was a 70 year-old man died in Le Havre after falling while attempting to close his balcony shutters, according to France’s interior ministry. Meanwhile, in Belgium, a 65-year-old woman and a 5-year-old child were killed in Ghent after being hit by branches in two separate incidents, the East Flanders public prosecutor’s office said in a statement. The storm has also hit the British Isles and Channel Islands, where red alert warnings are in place. On the island of Jersey, all schools and the airport were closed, according to the government’s website. In the southwestern county of Cornwall, 8,500 people were without power, the local council said on X (formerly Twitter), trees were blocking dozens of roads, and more than 100 schools were closed. Local media images showed waves crashing into and breaching sea walls in the southwestern English county of Cornwall. The UK’s Met Office has warned that the combination of strong winds and rain posed a “danger to life” from flying debris, as trees and homes are expected to suffer damage. Large waves could damage coastal roads and properties. Disruption to travel is expected. Several rail companies have warned people not to commute, even in the capital, although the Met Office said late Thursday morning that the storm’s path had moved further south than earlier projections showed. The strongest winds will likely be confined to areas closest to the coast, it said. Storm Ciarán follows less than two weeks after Storm Babet, which brought strong winds, heavy rainfall and flash flooding to parts of Scotland and northern and central England, killing several people. The human-induced climate crisis is making some storms more frequent and intense. As the Earth’s atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water vapor — so when it rains, it rains much more intensely. “There are a lot of attribution studies and other lines of evidence showing that autumn/winter storms like this are more damaging because of climate change,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London. “The rainfall associated with these types of storms is more severe due to climate change, and the storm surges are higher and thus more damaging due to the higher sea levels.” CNN’s Angela Dewan, Pierre Bairin, James Frater and Eve Brennan contributed to this report.",Weather
Thousands flee Highland Fire in California as hot and dry Santa Ana winds stoke the flames," A vegetation fire in California’s Riverside County exploded in size as it was stoked by hot and dry Santa Ana winds, scorching multiple structures and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. When the fire – dubbed the Highland Fire – was first reported Monday at 12:37 p.m. PDT, near Aguanga, California, it was only 14 acres in size. Just seven hours later, the fire had grown to more than 1,200 acres, according to Cal Fire. As of early Tuesday morning, the Highland Fire had charred 2,200 acres and was 0% contained, Cal Fire reported﻿. It has destroyed at least three structures and damaged six others. Evacuation orders were first issued Monday afternoon but were quickly expanded Monday evening and then again on Tuesday morning. More than 1,100 homes have been evacuated in the area of the fire, affecting approximately 4,000 people, Riverside Fire spokesperson Maggie Cline De La Rosa told CNN. Another 1,700 people have been warned that they might also have to evacuate. The evacuation orders and warnings – the latter of which are meant to warn residents to prepare for an evacuation order – are still active. See a map of the evacuations here Sustained wind speeds of 20 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph are forecast in and around the area of the Highland Fire on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. These winds will continue to challenge firefighters and could further increase the size of the fire. At least 310 firefighters from 49 engine companies were responding to the fire as of Tuesday morning, according to Cal Fire. The cause of the fire is under investigation. While its origin remains unclear, it is not a mystery how the Highland Fire was able to grow so quickly. Extremely dry air and strong winds in California on Monday and Tuesday combined to fuel rapid fire spread. Relative humidity – a measure of how much moisture is in the air – was very low on Monday: around 5% to 15%, according to a forecast discussion from the National Weather Service in San Diego. When relative humidity decreases, fires are easily triggered and sustained. Once fires form, gusty winds cause these fires to spread quickly and even blow their embers into the distance to start additional fires. Winds gusted over 50 mph near the fire, driven by a Santa Ana event which began over the weekend across parts of Southern California. Santa Ana winds, nicknamed for the Southern California mountain range, are seasonal hot and dry winds that develop when air flows from east to west — something it’s prone to do there in the fall and winter. As air travels from the high elevation of the mountains down to sea level, it is compressed by higher pressure, which heats it up and dries it out. Santa Ana winds can become quite strong as they rush down mountains, enhanced by canyons and passes that act as natural wind tunnels. The winds can dry out vegetation, making it more fire prone, and fan the flames of existing fires. California wildfires have been pacing well-below average so far this year, with over 315,000 acres burned as of October 31. Typically, fires have scorched 1.5 million acres of California by this point in the year, according to CAL FIRE. CNN’s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this story",Weather
Where trick-or-treaters will face snow or chilling temperatures this Halloween," Millions of trick-or-treaters across the US will be reaching for extra layers, not umbrellas, this Halloween as temperatures fall to “scary” levels for October. Much of the contiguous US will remain dry as people go door-to-door Tuesday evening in search of candy, with a couple of exceptions. A storm off the mid-Atlantic coast will bring showers from the Carolinas to southern New Jersey just in time for trick-or-treating Tuesday evening. Check your local forecast here A few snow showers will also spread across portions of the Great Lakes on Tuesday. Flakes began to fall early Tuesday morning across portions of Wisconsin and Illinois and will spread east into parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio by Tuesday night. The first snow of the season could arrive in Chicago on Tuesday, but very little accumulation is expected. Conditions across the rest of the US will range from chilly to downright cold by Tuesday evening with about 120 million people under freeze watches and warnings. A shot of bone-chilling air plunged south out of Canada early this week and overspread much of the US early Tuesday, sending temperatures plummeting by as much as 30 degrees and making it feel more like December than October. High temperatures for much of the East and parts of the South on Tuesday will fall nearly 10 degrees short of what’s normal for the end of October. It’ll feel more like early December from Burlington, Vermont, to Atlanta. Philadelphia and Washington, DC, climbed solidly into the 80s over the weekend but will struggle to make it out of the low 50s by Tuesday afternoon and drop into the upper 40s by late Tuesday evening. Portions of the West Coast and Florida will be the only areas of the contiguous US to avoid goosebumps on Halloween. In Dallas, the high temperature will be in the 50s on Tuesday – nearly 20 degrees below normal – and will feel more like late December than October. Any trick-or-treaters out on Tuesday evening will need to bundle up as temperatures fall into the 40s. Temperatures in the Rockies will begin a slow rebound on Tuesday from the weekend’s teeth-chattering cold, but conditions will generally remain quite chilly for late October. Just like a carved pumpkin, this cold won’t last forever. Chilly air will persist across the northern tier of the US for much of the week, but the South and much of the central US will trend back toward normal before the weekend.",Weather
Hurricane Otis death toll climbs to 45 in Mexico," At least 45 people have died after powerful Hurricane Otis tore through southern Mexico’s Guerrero state as a devastating Category 5 storm last week, the region’s governor said Sunday. At least 47 people remain missing, Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado Pineda said in a Monday morning news conference. Shortly after midnight Wednesday, the record-breaking storm brought sustained winds of 165 mph ashore near Acapulco, leaving the popular southern Mexico tourist destination in ruins. Salgado Pineda’s said Sunday that 340 people have been rescued by Mexican authorities. The hurricane impacted 220,035 homes and 80% of the area’s hotels were damaged, according to the Mexican government’s preliminary damage assessment. The health sector reported ground-floor flooding at one hospital, and electromechanical equipment and the medicinal gas supply were affected at another hospital, authorities said in a statement Saturday. Falling trees and landslides triggered by Otis resulted in multiple roads being closed. Mexico’s Seismic Alert System (SASMEX) has damage to 27 sensors in the Pacific Ocean region. The Acapulco International Airport also suffered damage, but operations have since resumed, officials said. An underestimation of the threat in early forecasts left residents and officials in southern Mexico with minimal time to prepare for Otis’s severity. Within a mere 12 hours, Otis rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to the area’s strongest storm on record, CNN previously reported. The devastation from Otis left structures, including some high-rise buildings, in shambles with exposed cinder blocks, scattered pieces of wood and nonexistent rooftops, images and video showed. Storm surge and rain inundated roads with several feet of murky floodwaters. The storm knocked out power in over half a million homes and businesses across the Guerrero state, according to Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission, which had restored electricity to 58% of those affected in Acapulco by Sunday, according to the governor. “They have been intense days of permanent work, without rest and with the sole aim of recovering our Acapulco. We are advancing in efficiently distributing humanitarian aid, providing relevant supports and advancing in restoring services,” Salgado Pineda said. Around 10,000 military members were deployed to the Acapulco area to assist with efforts, authorities said. Guerrero’s state government said it coordinated the transfer of 200 tourists farther inland to Mexico City. President Joe Biden said in a statement Friday he is “deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation” from Hurricane Otis. “I have directed my Administration to work closely with our partners in the Government of Mexico to offer our full support,” Biden said in the statement. “We are also working to ensure the safety of American citizens in and around Acapulco.” CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe and Mary Gilbert contributed to this report.",Weather
Halloween will feel like December after 30 degree temperature drop in East," Millions across the US will be reaching for extra layers this Halloween as temperatures fall to “scary” levels for October.

Portions of the West Coast and Florida will be the only areas of the contiguous US to avoid goosebumps on Halloween as the December-like air takes hold. The pattern change will be quite a shock in parts of the East where temperatures flip from unseasonable weekend warmth to unseasonable early week chill – a difference of over 30 degrees in many locations. Philadelphia and Washington, DC, climbed solidly into the 80s over the weekend but will struggle to make it out of the low 50s by Tuesday afternoon. Temperatures for much of the East and parts of the South on Tuesday will fall nearly 10 degrees short of what’s normal for the end of October.

Before-and-afters show devastation from Category 5 Hurricane Otis in Mexico," New satellite images capture the scale of destruction Category 5 Hurricane Otis wrought in Acapulco and southern Mexico. Few in history have endured a storm as strong as Otis – Acapulco never has. Its 165-mph winds and stronger gusts were akin to a slow-moving, 30-mile-wide, EF3 tornado. At least 27 people were killed as the sea surged inland, urged forward by the storm’s wind which ripped and tore away at Acapulco’s skyline. The city’s many high-rise hotels and residences which gleamed invitingly in the tropical sun before Otis are now mud-stained skeletons of concrete and twisted metal. An estimated 80% of hotels in Acapulco have been severely damaged, Jorge Laurel, former president of the Acapulco Association of Hotels and Tourist Enterprises told CNN. “This is a chaotic situation, a devastating scenario with unquantifiable damages,” Laurel told CNN. “There is no power, the entire electrical grid is semi-destroyed or totally destroyed.” The unforecasted and exceptional suddenness by which Otis strengthened, fed by a warmer ocean, is a brutal example of the storms scientists say humans can expect in a climate changed by planet-warming pollution. And it caught many off guard in Acapulco, some of whom are still missing. Melitón López came to the city Thursday to find his daughter Fátima who he had not heard from since the storm started its assault. “She said, ‘I’m on the bridge, there’s a lot of damage, trees are falling, pieces of buildings are falling,’ and then we didn’t hear from her anymore,” López said. Laurel estimated 40,000 visitors were in Acapulco before the storm hit, despite it being the offseason for tourism. A group of tourists told CNN they sheltered under a bridge for several hours as the storm raged around them after getting caught out while traveling back to their hotel via bus. The storm’s survivors who call this place home, and the tourists who sought it out as a place of escape, strapped what belongings remained to their cars, seeking shelter, a way out or both. Others turned to walking to try to find a way out of a city with a crippled airport and roads blocked and congested by debris and vehicles. Mexican authorities said Friday morning they were opening Acapulco’s airport in a limited capacity to commercial flights from Mexico City to evacuate people and bring medical supplies to the city. They also said they were sending 270 buses to the area to help evacuations. For those who remain, the extent of the damage is so severe, recovery seems a distant prospect. “Acapulco needs a lot of help, the federal government needs to put its full attention here, the reconstruction will take a long time, a lot of investment is required and many support programs,” Laurel said. Aid has been slow to come by and people are growing frustrated and more desperate with time. CNN witnessed people taking food and basic supplies from several stores. “The people are telling us they are not getting help – they are not getting water, they are not getting food,” CNN’s Gustavo Valdés reported from Acapulco Thursday. “They were telling us they just needed something to get by.” CNN’s Claudia Rebaza, Gustavo Valdés, David von Blohn, Abel Alvarado, David Shortell contributed to this story",Weather
"Hurricane Otis kills at least 27 in devastating blow to Acapulco, Mexico, that tore through high-rises and inundated roads"," At least 27 people are dead and Acapulco, Mexico, has been left in ruins after Hurricane Otis slammed into the coast Wednesday as a record-breaking Category 5 storm. Four people are also missing, Mexican Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodriguez said during a news conference on Thursday morning. ﻿Officials and military aid finally arrived in Acapulco late Wednesday after their travel was hindered by the same damage they came to help with and assess. What they found was devastating. Images and video show structures torn apart, including several high-rises. Storm surge and rain left roads inundated, leaving some to wade through several feet of murky water. “In all of Acapulco there is not a standing [electric] pole,” Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said during a news conference Thursday. The president said there were more than 1,000 workers working to rebuild the grid so water service can be restored to the area. More than 500,000 homes and businesses lost power across Mexico’s Guerrero state, power utility CFE said. Service had been restored to 40% of those affected, it added. A popular tourist destination, about 80% of Acapulco’s hotels were impacted by Otis, according to Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado. Salgado said her office is “supporting tourists” with “30 to 40 trucks that are outside hotels to evacuate (visitors) to other areas free of charge.” Officials and residents were left with little time to prepare for the severity of the storm because early forecasts significantly underestimated the threat. Otis rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to an extremely dangerous Category 5 hurricane – the area’s strongest storm on record – in just 12 hours. Otis weakened quickly once it moved inland. By Wednesday afternoon, it had dissipated over the mountains of southern Mexico. The storm’s heavy rains are forecast to continue impacting the region through Thursday, possibly triggering flash flooding and mudslides, the National Hurricane Center said. Though the immediate threat has subsided, the region is just beginning the path to recovery. Around 10,000 members of the military were deployed to the Acapulco area to help the efforts, authorities said. Mexican National Guard personnel have been working to clear stranded vehicles, downed trees and other debris scattered in the storm, the agency said in a news release. The Acapulco International Airport has suspended operations as it recovers from the storm, the office of Mexico’s Secretary of Infrastructure, Communications, and Transportation said in a release. The agency shared images of large piles of debris thrown around the airport. Otis’ rapid intensification is a symptom of the human-caused climate crisis, scientists say – a scenario that is becoming more frequent. Scientists have defined rapid intensification as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, generally requiring significant ocean heat. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, El Niño is growing in the Pacific this year, driving ocean temperatures even higher.

Halloween temperatures will be spine-chilling for some trick-or-treaters," Trick-or-treaters are in for a shock this Halloween as an impressive shot of cold air from Canada plunges into the US and temperatures plummet in its wake. High pressure from Canada will slide into the central US and keep conditions dry for many trick-or-treaters. But it will also bring the cold air which may come as a surprise to many in the South and East who will be coming off a warmer weekend. By Halloween, temperatures will be below-average across much of the country, save for the West Coast. Temperatures will start to drop in parts of the already cold Northern Plains Saturday. The cold will linger there, and bone-chilling temperatures in the 20s and 30s will be widespread on Halloween night. Costumes might need a few extra layers in Bismark, North Dakota, which will have a high temperature of 27 degrees – more typical for mid-December than late October. Factor in the wind chill and it will feel like the mid-teens. The cold is expected to creep into the Midwest and Central Plains by Sunday, bringing frosty conditions and much cooler temperatures through Tuesday. Kansas City and Chicago might struggle to reach the 40s on Halloween day. The cold air will hit the mid-Atlantic and Southeast just in time for Halloween, causing temperatures to crash. On Monday, Birmingham, Alabama, will have a high temperature near 80 degrees. Just 24 hours later, the high temperature will only reach 58 degrees. Mild and mostly dry conditions will prevail for the Southeast, but other parts of the country aren’t so lucky. The Great Lakes could see a snowflake or two on Halloween as temperatures spiral downward. Erie, Pennsylvania, and Cleveland could see snow Tuesday evening overnight into Wednesday. A few showers are possible in parts of the mid-Atlantic spanning southward into Tennessee, so Halloween plans could be foiled into Tuesday evening. The West Coast will luck out this Halloween. Temperatures will be near normal, from the 50s to the mid 70s, and the region will also dodge rain.",Weather
"Hurricane Otis’ explosive intensification is a symptom of the climate crisis, scientists say"," The rapid intensification Hurricane Otis underwent in the hours before it slammed into southern Mexico is a symptom of the human-caused climate crisis, scientists say – and one that is becoming more frequent. When it happens right before landfall, as it did with Otis, it can catch coastal communities by surprise with little time to prepare. The hurricane’s intensification was among the fastest forecasters have ever seen: its top-end windspeed increased by 115 mph in 24 hours. Only one other storm, Hurricane Patricia in 2015, exceeded Otis’ rapid intensification in East Pacific records, with a 120-mph increase in 24 hours. The term rapid intensification refers to when a storm’s winds strengthen rapidly over a short amount of time. Scientists have defined it as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, and it generally requires significant ocean heat. The National Hurricane Center said Otis strengthened so fast on Tuesday that it had “explosively intensified.” Otis “took full advantage of a warm patch of ocean” that was roughly 88 degrees Fahrenheit, said Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami – more than enough ocean heat to fuel a monster storm. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, an El Niño is growing in the Pacific this year, driving ocean temperatures even higher. Otis’ strengthening “was extremely unusual,” McNoldy told CNN. “It’s unfortunate it happened right before making landfall, but if this had occurred over the open ocean, it still would have been very remarkable.” Tropical storms usually take several days to grow into powerful hurricanes, but with human-caused climate change, rapid intensification is becoming a more common occurrence, said Suzana Camargo, hurricane expert and professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “It’s very rare for intense storms to make landfall in Mexico’s eastern Pacific side,” Camargo told CNN. Only one hurricane, Category 1 Hurricane Max in 2017, has made landfall within 50 miles of Acapulco, according to a CNN analysis of NOAA data. “But we have an El Niño year, which makes the eastern north Pacific Ocean more active than normal, and on top of that you have anthropogenic climate change,” Camargo said. The alarming rapid intensification trend has also been reported in the Atlantic. A recent study found that Atlantic hurricanes may now be more than twice as likely to strengthen from a weak Category 1 storm to a major Category 3 in a 24-hour period than they were between 1970 and 1990. A 2019 study found that between the 1980s and early 200s, Atlantic hurricanes showed a “highly unusual” increase in rapid intensification – a trend the report said could only be explained by human-caused climate change. And, concerningly, scientists found significant intensification was happening to the strongest storms, making the most life-threatening hurricanes even more dangerous. Rapid intensification has been historically hard to predict, but with climate change making oceans warmer, scientists are confident it is a phenomenon that will occur more often. “All of this is just confirming what we expected,” Camargo said.",Weather
"Hurricane Otis’ Category 5 ‘nightmare scenario’ knocks out all communications in Acapulco, Mexico"," Hurricane Otis knocked out all communications and unleashed a “nightmare scenario” in Acapulco in southern Mexico on Wednesday morning. Tracking over the incredibly warm ocean water near the coast, the storm rapidly intensified just before landfall and gave officials and residents little time to prepare. Otis strengthened from a tropical storm to an extremely dangerous Category 5 hurricane in just 12 hours before it slammed ashore as the strongest storm on record to hit this area and the Pacific coast of Mexico. The sudden burst of power took many by surprise as Otis bore down on Acapulco, a popular tourist destination that’s also home to roughly 800,000 people. As Otis kept strengthening and neared the coast, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warned that a “nightmare scenario” was unfolding. Otis’ center slammed into Mexico’s coast near Acapulco at around 12:25 a.m. local time with sustained winds of 165 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The much weaker storm is now headed inland and is expected to dissipate over southern Mexico by Wednesday night, the center said. Read more: Hurricane Otis’ explosive intensification is a symptom of the climate crisis, scientists say The storm’s full scope of devastation is not yet clear. Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday morning his government had no reports of casualties, but all communication systems in the area are down, including with emergency crews on the ground. López Obrador said they had reports of material damage and roads blocked by landslides. Mexican officials are driving to Acapulco to assess the damage in person given the loss of communications and because officials said the area can’t be reached by air. “We don’t have a damage assessment because until now, there is no communication with Acapulco,” National Coordinator of Civil Protection Laura Velázquez said in an interview with local news Milenio TV. “We are going there because we do not have any communication with our colleagues who have already been there for a week doing preventive work for a tropical storm and which in 12 hours became a hurricane,” Velázquez explained. The storm knocked out power to more than 500,000 customers in Mexico’s Guerrero state, the power company CFE said in a statement. Power was restored to 40% of those customers, the utility added. On Tuesday night, the president implored coastal residents of the state of Guerrero, which includes Acapulco, to seek shelter and stay away from rivers, streams and ravines ahead of the storm’s landfall. Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado Pineda announced Wednesday morning temporary shelters were open in Tecpan de Galeana, Coyuca de Benítez and Acapulco. Otis was not forecast to become a hurricane until early Tuesday morning, a little more than 24 hours before it would make its unprecedented Category 5 landfall. A hurricane watch was issued Monday afternoon for Acapulco and surrounding parts of the coast. The forecast was on the “high side of pretty much all the intensity guidance” that forecasters get from computer models, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, told CNN. But the storm was still severely underestimated. Brennan said the satellite data and hurricane models were underplaying its current intensity and how strong it could potentially get. Disruptive high-level winds were expected to keep a lid on Otis’ strength. But it was a small storm, which made it much more prone to big changes in intensity. As Tuesday progressed, and the storm began to move over incredibly warm water near the coast, it became clear environmental conditions weren’t playing out as forecasters expected and Otis was not going to be held back. The forecasters at the National Hurricane Center were using satellites to estimate the intensity of Otis, a common practice for tropical systems – but there can be problems with this method. “We don’t always have the best, complete picture of what’s going on underneath the cloud canopy you see on satellite imagery,” Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, told CNN. That’s where NOAA’s aircraft reconnaissance team, the Hurricane Hunters, come in. Planes drop sensors into the storm to take real-time measurements as they fall through the cyclone, including wind speed and pressure. “By the time we had the Hurricane Hunter aircraft fly into the storm (Tuesday) afternoon, the data revealed that the storm was about 20 to 30 mph stronger than we would have estimated from just looking at satellite imagery,” Brennan told CNN. Brennan said the NHC typically deploys aircraft reconnaissance in the Eastern Pacific for “hurricane threats to land areas.” CNN has asked Brennen why the Hurricane Hunters were not sent into the storm earlier than Tuesday afternoon. The newly acquired aircraft data confirmed Otis had begun to rapidly intensify and the storm’s forecast changed dramatically. “It’s always the worst- case scenario when you have a storm [rapidly intensifying] very close to landfall, when you’re having to make significant upward adjustments to the forecast and the reality of the scenario that people are going to face is very different from what they may initially plan for,” Brennan told CNN. Here’s how quickly the storm escalated on Tuesday. All times are in Acapulco time. 3 a.m. –  65 mph tropical storm: The NHC first forecasts a hurricane and says there is “about 1 in 4 chance of rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours.” 9 a.m. – 70 mph tropical storm: The NHC ups its intensity forecast slightly and notes some forecast models show “a greater than normal probability” of rapid intensification and “further upward adjustments to the intensity forecast are possible later today.” Noon –  80 mph Category 1 hurricane: The hurricane tracks into very warm water off the Mexico coast and begins rapidly intensifying, aided by moist air and favorable high level winds, two ingredients that allow cyclones to grow stronger. “Further strengthening [is] likely until landfall,” the hurricane center warns. 1 to 2 p.m. – Hurricane Hunters fly through the eye of Otis, discovering it was much stronger than satellites had estimated. 3 p.m. – 125 mph Category 3 hurricane: The NHC dramatically alters its intensity forecast and calls for an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 140 mph shortly before landfall. 6 p.m. – 145 mph Category 4 hurricane: The NHC warns “…there are no signs of this explosive intensification stopping,” and forecasts Otis to reach Category 5 for the first time. 9 p.m. – 160 mph Category 5 hurricane: The hurricane center warns “a nightmare scenario is unfolding for southern Mexico this evening with rapidly intensifying Otis approaching the coastline.” 12:25 a.m. Wednesday - Otis makes landfall as a 165 mph, Category 5 hurricane. Otis’ intensification was among the fastest forecasters have seen; its top-end windspeed increased by 115 mph in 24 hours and 90 mph in a 12-hour period. The storm’s rapid intensification is a symptom of the human-caused climate crisis, scientists say – and one that is becoming more frequent. Scientists have defined rapid intensification as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, generally requiring significant ocean heat. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, El Niño is growing in the Pacific this year, driving ocean temperatures even higher. Otis’ strengthening “was extremely unusual,” Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami, told CNN. “It’s unfortunate it happened right before making landfall, but if this had occurred over the open ocean, it still would have been very remarkable.” Before Otis, there had not been a Category 5 landfall for the East Pacific, according to the NOAA Hurricane Database. The previous strongest landfall was Hurricane Patricia in 2015, which made landfall as a Category 4 Hurricane with winds of 150 mph.",Weather
The driest place in North America has sprung to life with lakes and flowers after Hurricane Hilary," California’s Death Valley is the hottest place in the world and the driest place in North America. But two months after Hurricane Hilary’s epic rainfall, parts of the national park look more oasis than desert. Parched ground turned to ponds, wildflowers are in bloom in remote areas and a salt flat is now a massive lake. The salt flat-turned-lake is an exceptional but fleeting sight to behold. “It is definitely a rare and special event,” Death Valley park spokesperson Abby Wines told CNN, only happening roughly once a decade. It’s all because Hilary unloaded a year’s worth of rain, 2.2 inches, on Death Valley in just 24 hours on August 20 – the wettest day in the park’s history. Until then, the park had never recorded more than 2 inches of rainfall in a single day, according to records that date to 1911. The parched desert soil couldn’t absorb the excessive rainfall fast enough, which triggered flash flooding. The torrent of water washed away trails and much of everything else in its path. “Every road in the park was damaged,” Wines told CNN. “We still have a lot of work ahead of us.” Damage was so severe it forced Death Valley National Park to close from late August to mid-October, the longest closure in its history, Mike Reynolds, the park’s superintendent, said in a news release. Now that the park is partially reopened, some of the rare sights have a limited window to be seen, while others will forever be out of reach. Floodwaters pooled in many locations throughout the expansive park in Hilary’s immediate aftermath, including the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. Mud cracks are the only evidence of the many pools which have dried out since August. Excess water also sent wildflowers into early bloom in a remote area of the park difficult for most visitors to access, according to Wines. But the most impressive result of Hilary’s wrath can still be seen in person – the only question is for how long. Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, is home to a temporary lake that is several miles long, according to the National Park Service. Badwater sits at 282 feet below sea level, so it’s no surprise floodwater pooled here. The true surprise is the water’s staying power. Nearly two months after the historic floods, water remains trapped there. “It was a lot of rain (from Hilary) and it’s going to take a while for all that water to evaporate – even in the desert,” Wines told CNN. A month after Hilary, Wines took a kayak out to Badwater’s lake and estimated the water’s depth to be about a foot. Now the lake is only a few inches deep and may dry up within a few weeks, according to the NPS. The lake’s lifespan will depend heavily on the weather over the next few weeks: The hotter and drier the weather, the faster its water will evaporate. But average high temperatures in Death Valley drop quickly during the fall and get nowhere near the record-shattering heat of summer. High temperatures are forecast to dip into the 80s later this week and only top out in the 70s by early next week, which may slow the pace of evaporation. “I wish we knew exactly how long it will last,” Wines said, adding she thinks there will probably be some water there through November. Wines had one piece of advice for visitors hoping to see the rare wonder: “The sooner the better.”",Weather
"First significant snowstorm of the season targets northwestern US, Northern Plains in an early sign of winter"," The first significant snowfall of the season is on the way for the northwestern US and parts of the Northern Plains, and by the time the last flake falls, many high elevation areas will be buried in more than a foot of fresh snow. A surge of cold air and deep moisture will spread from Washington and Oregon through much of Montana on Tuesday before a potent storm drops into the Northwest on Tuesday night. Flakes will begin to fly as early as Monday night or Tuesday morning as moisture from this storm moves across the Cascades in Washington. The higher the elevation, the greater the chance for disruptive snow and tricky travel. Several key high-elevation mountain passes located in this part of the Cascades, including Stevens Pass, Snoqualmie Pass and Stampede Pass, could all be impacted. Snow will kick off for the rest of the northwestern US Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday evening. Accumulating snowfall will begin to cover portions of Idaho and Montana as well as the Cascades in Oregon during this window as temperatures struggle to climb above the freezing mark. Temperatures will plummet Tuesday night and force many high-elevation locations to fall well below freezing. Temperatures in northern Idaho will drop into the teens by early Wednesday morning while parts of northwestern Montana will bottom out in the single digits. The combination of frigid air and ample moisture will set the stage for heavy snow to develop on Tuesday night. Six inches or more of snow could pile up quickly at pass levels in the Cascades on Tuesday night, with amounts approaching a foot possible for areas above 7,000 feet. Snow accumulations will climb higher on Wednesday across the Northwest and northern Rockies. Wind speeds will also increase during this time and blow snow, which could significantly reduce visibility and worsen travel. While the most significant snowfall totals from this storm will be in the highest elevations, some low elevation spots in Washington, Montana and South Dakota will not completely escape wintry weather. A few inches of snow will accumulate down to 1,000 feet in parts of Washington on Wednesday, but Seattle will endure only a chilly rain. Snow will begin to wind down across the Cascades on Thursday, but will overspread portions of the northern Plains as the storm treks east. More than a foot of heavy snow will bury parts of South Dakota on Thursday and into Thursday night. Another risk will arise where snow does fall in lower elevation areas – melting and refreezing. Any snow that melts during the day will only freeze up overnight and cause treacherous ice to form along roadways and sidewalks. By Friday, significant accumulating snow will come to an end across much of the northern US, but a few flakes will still fly along the US-Canada border before the storm crosses fully into southern Canada.",Weather
"Norma weakens to tropical storm after Mexico landfall, while Tammy bears down on Leeward Islands"," Norma weakened to tropical storm strength Saturday after bringing hurricane-force winds, flash flooding and storm surge to Mexico’s Pacific coast. Meanwhile, another late-season storm continued to threaten island nations in the Atlantic. Norma made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80 mph over the far southern portion of Mexico’s Baja California Sur – which includes Cabo San Lucas – Saturday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said. Meanwhile in the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy made landfall in Barbuda as a Category 1 storm Saturday night, churning maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. Tammy has triggered hurricane warnings, with strong winds and heavy rainfall across portions of the Leeward Islands, a chain of several island nations and territories between the Caribbean Sea and the open Atlantic. Neither storm is a threat to the US mainland. Norma’s maximum sustained winds decreased to 70 mph, and the tropical storm was centered about 30 miles north-northeast of Cabo San Lucas as of Saturday night, the hurricane center said. The tropical storm is expected to cross the southernmost portion of Baja California Sur in the evening before emerging over the southern Gulf of California on Sunday. Mexico’s government downgraded the hurricane warning spanning from Todos Santos to Los Barriles to a tropical storm warning Saturday night, the hurricane center said. However, threats from Norma still remain, as it could bring life-threatening conditions to a tourist-friendly region of Mexico, home to a few hundred thousand people. A dangerous storm surge “is likely to produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area” Saturday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rains and flash flooding from Norma are forecast to persist through the weekend, the hurricane center said. “Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,” the hurricane center said. Norma will bring heavy rainfall and flooding to the area. Rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with isolated totals approaching 18 inches are possible. The weakening cyclone should turn toward the northeast and east-northeast and slowly approach the coast of Sinaloa in western Mexico on Sunday night into early Monday as a tropical storm, according to the hurricane center. Norma is forecast to move inland by early Monday and dissipate over the rugged terrain of western Mexico by Tuesday. In the Atlantic, Tammy maintained maximum sustained winds of 85 mph by Saturday night, with slow strengthening possible over the next few days, the National Hurricane Center said in its update at 8 p.m. ET Saturday. Tammy is expected to move near or over portions of the Leeward Islands – including Antigua and Barbuda – through Saturday night, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands on Sunday. Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 25 miles from the storm’s center and tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 125 miles. Hurricanes in this part of the Atlantic are rare for late October. Tammy is only the third hurricane to form this far southeast in the Atlantic since 1900, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry. It’s also the latest-forming hurricane in this part of the Atlantic since 1966, according to Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Experts previously warned hurricanes could form in unusual areas later in the season this year because of the exceptionally warm Atlantic Ocean. A storm surge of 1 to 3 feet is possible for parts of the Leeward Islands. Heavy rainfall will be one of the storm’s most serious threats and could result in flash flooding and mudslides. Rainfall totals for the Leeward Islands are expected to be 4 to 8 inches, but could reach a foot in places where the heaviest rain sets up. Rain should be lighter in Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin Islands, where 1 to 2 inches of rain is most likely. Conditions will begin to improve from south to north across the island chain by late Sunday as the storm moves north out of the region. With Tammy in the Atlantic, only two names are left – Vince and Whitney – on the standard Atlantic storm name list before the hurricane center turns to an alternate list of names.",Weather
Hurricanes will strike land this weekend by two different oceans," Two hurricanes will strike land this weekend by two different ocean basins – Tammy in the Atlantic and Norma in the eastern Pacific. Neither are a threat to the US, but Norma has triggered hurricane warnings for Mexico, including the popular resort town of Cabo San Lucas, and Tammy for portions of the Leeward Islands, a chain of several island nations between the Caribbean Sea and the open Atlantic. In the Atlantic, Tammy maintained maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and was centered about 25 miles north-northeast of Guadeloupe, the National Hurricane Center said at 2 p.m. ET. Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 25 miles from the storm’s center and tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 125 miles. Tammy was expected to move near or over portions of the Leeward Islands through Saturday night, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands on Sunday. It’s also the latest-forming hurricane in this part of the Atlantic since 1966, according to Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Experts previously warned hurricanes could form in unusual areas later in the season this year because of the exceptionally warm Atlantic Ocean.

Rain should be lighter in Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin Islands, where 1 to 2 inches of rain is most likely. Conditions will begin to improve from south to north across the island chain by late Sunday as the storm moves north out of the region. With Tammy in the Atlantic, only two names are left – Vince and Whitney – on the standard Atlantic storm name list before the hurricane center turns to an alternate list of names. Hurricane Norma was a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph in the Pacific Ocean on Friday night, the National Hurricane Center said. It was centered about 145 miles south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The storm is expected to weaken before any Saturday landfall. But it still is expected to be a hurricane when it moves near or over the southern portion of Baja California Sur – including the Cabo San Lucas area – late Saturday afternoon or early Saturday evening. And a dangerous storm surge “is likely to produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area,” the National Hurricane Center said. “Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,” the hurricane center said. Tropical storm conditions were expected to ramp up to hurricane conditions in southern Baja California Sur, including Cabo San Lucas, by early Saturday. The storm will bring heavy rainfall and flooding to the area through Sunday. Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches with isolated totals approaching 15 inches are possible through Sunday across the far southern portion of California Baja Sur. “These rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain,” the National Hurricane Center warned. After raking Baja California Sur, the storm will then make a turn to the east, cross the Gulf of California, and make landfall somewhere along the eastern coast of mainland Mexico by early Monday.",Weather
It’s rained every weekend for nearly two months in the Northeast. Here’s what’s causing it and when it might end," Prepare for another dose of wet weekend weather in the Northeast, but this time, the dreary déjà vu comes with a twist –  some snowflakes may fly in high elevations. It has rained on a Saturday or Sunday in parts of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic every weekend since late August. Other locations have managed to stay dry for a weekend here and there, but have endured mostly dreary conditions for almost two full months. In Philadelphia and New York City, this weekend is shaping up to be the seventh consecutive wet weekend, and the eighth wet weekend since late August. It’s not just been miserable. Wet weekend weather has also put a damper on vital fall foliage tourism in New England. Why is the Northeast stuck in this seemingly-never-ending loop? Meteorologists say to blame the upper atmosphere, where a stubborn weather pattern has opened the door for storms to cross the region. “We have these overall patterns that generally last roughly six to eight weeks with storm systems coming through every six to eight days,” Sarah Johnson, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey, told CNN. These storms are progressive in nature, which means they track across the country at a consistent pace without slowing down significantly or stalling. It’s largely a coincidence that this pattern is targeting weekend days, according to Johnson. “If we had been luckier, or unluckier depending on how you look at it, and (the pattern) started on a Wednesday, we’d be seeing storms more in the middle of each week,” Johnson said. But there will be no such luck again this weekend, as two systems work together to bring soggy and dreary conditions to the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic. A storm and its associated cold front will move across the Great Lakes on Friday and push into the Northeast by Friday night. Meanwhile, a storm will begin to develop off the mid-Atlantic coast on Friday and send a plume of deep moisture into parts of New Jersey, New York and New England. By Saturday, the coastal storm will get a boost of extra energy and become the primary weather-maker for the Northeast. Rain will persist across much of the Northeast as the coastal storm strengthens. Steady rain and even a few thunderstorms will target portions of New England on Saturday. Any rumbles of thunder are most likely in eastern Massachusetts, including Boston. Saturday’s rain is unlikely to cause any widespread flooding, but ponding on roadways or low-lying areas may occur in spots with multiple downpours. Showers will linger for parts of the mid-Atlantic on Saturday, but the region will slowly begin to dry out. Friday is likely to be the wettest day of the next several for Philadelphia, but showers and clouds are expected to linger into Saturday. Wet weather is expected to span from Friday into Saturday night in New York City. The coastal storm will track northward Saturday night through Sunday and wind speeds will increase, especially for coastal locations. Wind gusts of 20 to 30 mph will be common from late Saturday to Sunday from coastal Massachusetts to coastal Maine. Temperatures will plummet on Saturday night and bottom out in the 30s or low 40s for much of the Northeast by early Sunday morning. In high elevation areas like New York’s Adirondack Mountains and the Green and White Mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire, tumbling temperatures could turn raindrops into snowflakes and a possibly slushy coating of snow Saturday night and Sunday. Rain will continue elsewhere across New York and New England on Sunday before gradually tapering off Sunday night. The storm is forecast to move away from the US on Monday, leaving the soggy region to dry out once more during the work week. It’s still unclear when the Northeast will be fully set free from this dismal loop, but there are signs of hope. The Climate Prediction Center predicts near-normal precipitation amounts for the Northeast from October 27 to November 2, or through next weekend. This doesn’t mean this period will be dry, but it does mean it’s unlikely to be excessively wet. To offer even more hope, meteorologists say patterns like the current one generally have a limited lifespan. Most last six to eight weeks and many locations have already spent at least six weeks in the dreary loop, so the end may not be too far off, Johnson told CNN. But not all setups conform perfectly, so the streak could continue. “It’s sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less,” Johnson said, describing the lifetime of a pattern. “We’ve been kind of stuck in this one.”",Weather
"You won’t just be able to watch the eclipse, you can also feel it"," Saturday’s ring of fire annular solar eclipse will alter weather conditions on the Earth’s surface as it plays out in the sky. Changes to temperature, wind speed and humidity occur as the moon crosses in front of the sun during a solar eclipse and casts a shadow on Earth’s surface. The more sunlight blocked, the more dramatic the weather changes. The effect is comparable to how shaded areas end up much cooler on a hot day than any place in direct sunlight. Saturday’s annular eclipse will block up to 90% of the sun In a narrow path from Oregon to Texas. Annular eclipses allow slightly more solar radiation – sunlight and energy – to make it to the Earth’s surface than a total eclipse, which entirely blocks the sun. But a reduction in solar radiation, no matter how brief, can affect temperatures and other weather. Not all eclipse weather changes are created equal, though. The exact drop in temperature can vary widely based on other factors like the time of year and cloud cover. An October annular eclipse is going to have a less dramatic effect on temperatures than an August total eclipse, not just because of the amount of sun blocked by the moon, but also the lower angle at which the sun strikes the Earth in fall compared to summer. A higher sun angle produces more intense sunshine and elevated temperatures, and the angle starts to drop in fall. 2017’s total solar eclipse took place during a summer afternoon in August, so temperatures were already high, making them more prone to crater in some locations along the path of totality. Temperatures fell 11 degrees over just one hour in Douglas, Wyoming, and widespread temperature drops of 4 to 8 degrees happened across the South. Temperature drops during Saturday’s eclipse are not expected to be as drastic, but could still dip a few degrees in the path of annularity. Areas only experiencing a partial solar eclipse could see a slower rise in temperatures from late morning to the early afternoon, Juan Hernandez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, Texas, told CNN. A slower rise in temperatures could limit how far high temperatures can climb in the afternoon hours and leave Saturday a bit cooler than if there were no eclipse.  This may happen in Dallas and Phoenix, where the moon will block 80% of the sun. An eclipse affects more than just temperature. Less solar radiation and reduced temperatures can also affect wind, humidity and cloud cover. The quick cooldown during an eclipse briefly reduces the amount of heat stored in the atmosphere. Heat forces air to rise and makes the atmosphere unstable. The atmosphere then creates clouds, storms and wind to let out heat energy in an attempt to bring itself back into balance. So as the eclipse cools the air, the atmosphere calms down and wind speeds drop because the atmosphere isn’t working as hard to balance itself out. Scientists took a number of weather measurements in Wyoming and New York during 2017’s total solar eclipse and found wind speeds dropped by an average of 6 mph as a result of the eclipse. How humid it feels is tied closely to temperature. Humidity rises when the air temperature and the dew point, which measures how much moisture is in the air, approach the same temperature. So when air temperatures briefly dip during an eclipse, they trend closer to the dew point and make the air feel a bit more humid. A significant temperature drop can also alter cloud cover. Clouds over parts of South Carolina disappeared during 2017’s total solar eclipse because they lost their fuel – heat that forces air to rise and form clouds. It’s possible a few clouds could also dissipate in Saturday’s eclipse, even with less drastic temperature drops.",Weather
The best places to see the ‘ring of fire’ eclipse this weekend," A “ring of fire” annular solar eclipse will put on a show from Oregon to Texas this Saturday – as long as clouds don’t spoil the fun. The moon doesn’t cover 100% of the sun in an annular solar eclipse like in a total solar eclipse, but instead allows some light to peek through and encircle the moon in a so-called “ring of fire,” also known as annularity. Only a narrow corridor of the western and central US will be able to experience the ring, when the moon will block out 90% of the sun for a few minutes on Saturday morning. The moon will obscure the sun to a lesser extent for the rest of the continental United States, creating a partial eclipse, so weather conditions will be key in determining whether you’ll be able to see it with protective eye wear where you live. Here are the best and worst places to see the eclipse unfold based on weather conditions: The best viewing conditions are likely across portions of Texas, where sunshine will be widespread. In San Antonio, the most populous city able to witness annularity, the eclipse will peak starting at 11:52 a.m. CDT, arrive at its maximum coverage at 11:54 a.m. and move past its peak by 11:56 a.m. The “ring of fire” will be visible during these few minutes. A few clouds may float by in the southern portion of the state but won’t be widespread enough to obscure the view completely. Much of Oregon won’t be so lucky; abundant clouds and some rain could steal the show. A storm will develop off the Pacific Northwest coast late Friday night and while it will stay offshore through Saturday, it will be close enough to disrupt the show. Any rain is most likely to fall in far western Oregon and western Washington, but clouds will spread much farther inland. Clouds may also ruin the view in parts of Nevada, but there could be pockets where they part just in time. Early morning clouds in Utah are expected to clear out right before the main event. Any clouds in New Mexico will likely be thin enough to keep viewing conditions ideal. The rest of the central and eastern US may still be able to see a partial eclipse block anywhere from 20% to 80% of the sun. That is, if clouds weren’t such an issue. Clouds will block views across most of the Midwest and portions of the East as storm systems impact each region. Some parts of the South may luck out, but with such widespread cloud cover, there will be a lot of disappointed eclipse watchers. Anyone who misses out on Saturday’s annular solar eclipse may want to make plans to get into the path of the first total solar eclipse since 2017 on April 8, 2024.",Weather
"Florida tornadoes damage homes, businesses and cars on both coasts"," At least one tornado damaged homes, cars and businesses in Florida as severe weather hit the state Thursday. A likely tornado damaged at least two homes in Clearwater Beach after it roared ashore early Thursday morning. No one was injured, Clearwater police said, but photos from the scene show debris scattered through streets and a home’s gutter impaling a car’s windshield. A 90-year-old woman was asleep in her home when the storm hit and collapsed a wall and the home’s roof in on her. She was uninjured, Clearwater police and fire officials said. “She woke up to the sound of glass breaking,” Clearwater Fire and Rescue spokesperson Rob Shaw told CNN. “She pulled the covers up over her head and rode out the storm.” Damage, including downed power lines, was also reported near the coast in Dunedin, north of Clearwater Beach, town officials said. Video posted to social media by the city showed walls and roofs missing from buildings and windows blown out of businesses. The National Weather Service will survey the damage to confirm it was from a tornado and determine its strength. More damage was reported from a separate potential tornado around 65 miles north in Crystal River. The reported tornado damaged and destroyed “a multitude” of businesses and homes in the city, Crystal River mayor Joe Meek said on social media. “There is a considerable amount of damage throughout the city,” Meek said. “We have no reported major injuries or reports of deaths which is truly remarkable. When you look at some of these pictures of the houses and the condition that they’re in – it’s just a miracle.” Citrus County officials said most of the roads that were closed because of downed power lines, trees and debris had since reopened. School was canceled across the county Thursday because of the damage. The storms kept tracking east across the state, reaching parts of northeast Florida Thursday morning. An EF2 tornado with winds of 115 mph cut a mile-long path of damage through Palm Coast on Florida’s Atlantic coast, the National Weather Service in Jacksonville said. Palm Coast fire chief Kyle Berryhill said several homes suffered “major structural damage” in Palm Coast’s Indian Trails neighborhood, but there were no injuries. Photos posted to social media by the Palm Coast government showed a car flipped on its side, roof damage and insulation strewn about a yard there. “We have several families that have experienced a catastrophic property loss and our hearts go out to them this morning,” Palm Coast fire chief Kyle Berryhill said in a Thursday morning news conference. Millions of Floridians were under a tornado watch through Thursday afternoon during the peak of the tornado threat. Wind gusts of 30 mph to 40 mph and bouts of heavy rain are possible into the afternoon across northern parts of the state as a storm system moves across the area. The storm system will begin to move off into the Atlantic waters during the early afternoon. This means heavy rainfall and strong thunderstorms will still be possible over the area through most of Thursday, with activity beginning to wind down into the evening.",Weather
"Powerful cross-country storm to deliver snow, severe weather and heavy rain"," A powerful storm will traverse nearly 1,500 miles of the US through the weekend and unload snow, severe thunderstorms and flooding rain along its path, culminating in the eighth consecutive dreary weekend in parts of the Northeast. The storm will dump the first significant snow of the season on parts of the Rockies, where low-elevation rain and high-elevation snow will continue through early Friday as the potent storm strengthens and tracks across the Plains. Parts of Colorado, Utah, Montana and South Dakota could see 6 to 12 inches of snow. Snow totals in higher elevations in Wyoming may approach 1 to 2 feet. While heavy snow falls in high elevations in the Rockies, heavy rain and thunderstorms – some of which could become severe – will target the Plains Thursday. The highest chance for severe thunderstorms will be from Thursday afternoon into Thursday night in parts of Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa, where a Level 2 out of 5 risk is in place. Large hail and damaging wind gusts are the primary threats, but a couple of tornadoes are also possible. Heavy rain will accompany some severe thunderstorms, but drenching rainfall will not be limited to those storms. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible Thursday and Thursday night across parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Rain and thunderstorms will shift east on Friday and expand across more of the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest. Another 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible in areas caught in the heaviest storms. Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Illinois are just a few states set for a soaking on Friday. The rain will help the drought-stricken Mississippi Valley and the historically low water levels on the Mississippi River. Following a dry and exceptionally hot summer, drought is present in every state in the Mississippi Valley and portions of the Plains. Exceptional drought – the most severe level of drought tracked by the US Drought Monitor – is in place across parts of Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa. Rainfall this week across the upper Mississippi River basin will eventually work its way into the river and cause slight rises in water levels by the end of October and early November, which could also help stymie the wedge of saltwater threatening drinking water in southern Louisiana. By Saturday, rain from the storm will spread into the Northeast and persist in the Midwest. The rain will make for yet another dreary weekend for parts of the region. Rain has fallen in the area almost like clockwork every weekend for some locations since the end of August. This could be the eighth consecutive weekend of rain for Philadelphia and the sixth consecutive for New York City. An inch or two of rain is possible across portions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York on Saturday, while parts of southern New England may skate through the weekend with under an inch of rain. Rainfall is expected to ease up early Sunday and some of the Northeast may even dry out completely by Sunday afternoon.",Weather
Lidia’s leftover rain raises flood concerns in western Mexico," Lidia dissipated early Wednesday morning after slamming into western Mexico as a Category 4 hurricane Tuesday night. But what’s left of the formerly powerful storm will unload heavy rainfall, raising the threat of flash flooding across portions of western Mexico. Lidia’s center was shredded apart by the mountainous terrain of western Mexico early Wednesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Despite the lack of an organized center, what’s left of Lidia will bring an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain to the country on Wednesday. Rainfall totals from the storm could come close to 12 inches. Flash flooding is possible across several Mexico states, especially Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima, as heavy rain pounds the area. Heavy rain may also lead to dangerous mudslides in mountainous terrain. Lidia had brought preliminary rainfall totals of 5.3 inches to Colima and 5.1 inches to Manzanillo as of early Wednesday. Lidia rapidly intensified at an exceptional pace right before landfall Tuesday on Mexico’s west coast.  The hurricane’s winds increased by 70 mph in 24 hours in the warm coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. The landfall was the strongest on Mexico’s west coast since 2015’s Hurricane Patricia. Rapid intensification is happening more often, especially immediately before landfall, because of human-caused climate change. It’s just one of the ways the climate crisis is making hurricanes more dangerous. Swells generated by Lidia on Tuesday will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the west coast of Mexico and Baja California peninsula through Wednesday. Moisture from Lidia’s remnants will send some rain into South Texas on Wednesday. Rain is desperately needed as this part of Texas battles severe and exceptional drought, according to the latest report from the US Drought Monitor.",Weather
"More heavy rain is on the way to the Northeast on Saturday, threatening NYC flooding again"," Heavy rain will once again lash parts of the Northeast on Saturday, bringing a flood threat to New York City for the second consecutive weekend. A cold front followed by remnants of former tropical storm Philippe are set to drench areas from northern New Jersey to as far north as Maine. These areas have a slight risk for excessive rainfall from Saturday morning through early Sunday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. “In addition to the heavy rainfall, gusty winds are expected for eastern Maine along the storm’s track, as well as high surf along the New England coast,” the prediction center said Friday. And although forecasters have said this weekend’s storms won’t bring as much rain as last week’s record-setting rainfall that wreaked havoc on New York City’s roads and subway system, some flood watches are in effect Saturday in those same hard-hit areas. Parts of southeastern New York – including much of New York City – southern Connecticut and northeastern New Jersey are under a flood watch from 2 a.m. Saturday through the evening, according to the National Weather Service. Much of Maine also will be under a flood watch from Saturday afternoon into Sunday. Generally 1 to 3 inches of rain are possible Saturday into Sunday from the New York City area and upstate New York to New England. Higher amounts, up to 5 inches, could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine. Maine and portions of northern New England are forecast to see the most significant impacts from Philippe’s remnants. As of Friday morning, the remnants of post-tropical cyclone Philippe were expected to move over parts of the Atlantic Canada and New England this weekend, the National Hurricane Center said. And this would be the third weekend in a row the Northeast gets walloped by heavy rainfall. Ophelia soaked the Northeast the weekend of September 23, followed by last weekend’s walls of rain that paralyzed air travel, flooded basements and triggered water rescues in New York City. As the storm moves in Saturday, New York City officials are warning residents to be prepared for 1.5 to 2.5 of rain citywide, with the potential for 3 to 4 inches in flood-prone areas. To that end, a deputy mayor urged basement residents to remove their belongings and move to higher ground by Friday night. “Since this is happening overnight, you might be asleep so you should be preparing now,” First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright told reporters Friday. Wright also implored New Yorkers to plan ahead as grounds still were saturated from last week’s storm, warning that potentially significant flooding and travel disruptions in typical flood prone areas are possible. “In this time of man-made climate crisis, flash floods and other climate events are a part of our reality,” Wright said. “This is in fact the new normal.” The city has more than 100 water rescue teams on standby, and crews are working to clear catch basins so they can absorb more water, city officials said in a news conference Friday. Experts and scientists have said human-induced climate change is a major driver of extreme weather events, which are likely to occur more frequently and severely.",Weather
Philippe will combine with a potent cold front to soak the Northeast this weekend," Philippe, a former tropical storm that is swiping Bermuda on Friday, will combine with a potent cold front to drench the Northeast and deliver gusty winds to parts of New England this weekend. Philippe had 50 mph winds and was making its closest approach to Bermuda Friday afternoon. It is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the island throughout the day. The system has transitioned into a more sprawling, wet and windy mess known as a post-tropical storm, and is on track to hit Maine Saturday night. A soggy, miserable weekend is likely across much of the Northeast, with the greatest chances for heavy rain likely in northern New England. Rain instigated by the cold front is already starting to work its way into far western parts of the Northeast Friday and will keep moving east through the weekend. A Level 2 of 4 slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in areas where repeated bouts of rain could trigger localized flash flooding. Much of the Northeast is coming off of one of its wettest summers on record, NOAA data shows. The wet trend has only continued into fall, raising the risk for flash flooding. Parts of the Northeast were inundated by record-breaking rainfall last week. The most intense rainfall hit the New York City tri-state, where floodwaters inundated subways, roads and basements and several locations recorded the wettest day in history. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine. Fall foliage is nearing or at peak condition in parts of Maine, so the timing of Philippe’s drenching rainfall could disrupt leaf peeping plans this weekend. In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday night into Sunday as Philippe comes ashore. Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are likely in Maine, with potential for stronger gusts on the coast. Lesser gusty winds will be more widespread across New England.",Weather
"Tropical Storm Philippe will deliver another wet, miserable weekend to the Northeast"," Tropical Storm Philippe is on track to deliver a dreary weekend to the Northeast, including a slug of tropical moisture which is raising the risk of flooding rainfall in an area that has been soaked repeatedly in recent weeks. The tropical storm has 50 mph winds and is still hundreds of miles from the US. Philippe is expected to transition into a post-tropical storm by the time it makes landfall in Maine or Atlantic Canada Saturday night, but this will have little effect on Philippe’s ability to unload heavy rainfall and spread gusty winds. Philippe’s projected track has echoes of Hurricane Lee in September, when the much-weakened post-tropical system brought strong winds and rain to parts of the Northeast and Canada. For now, portions of New England and eastern New York are most likely to experience heavy rain and potential flooding. A Level 2 of 4 slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday in these areas by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But the bull’s-eye of heaviest rainfall could shift if low pressure moving across the eastern US pulls Philippe closer to the Northeast. This potential shift could move the risk closer to the mid-Atlantic – an area where another deluge would be particularly worrisome. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible across New York and New England. Higher amounts closer to 2 to 4 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, likely in Maine. Fall foliage is nearing or at peak condition in parts of Maine, so the timing of Philippe’s drenching rainfall could disrupt leaf peeping plans this weekend. In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday night into Sunday as Philippe comes ashore. Philippe has quite a distance to travel before approaching the US and Canada but it will soon come in close contact with Bermuda. The island’s weather service issued a tropical storm warning Wednesday evening as Philippe closed in. Bermuda is only 15 miles across, so landfalls are rare. Only eleven systems have made landfall on the island since 1851, according to data from NOAA. But Philippe won’t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are likely across Bermuda when Philippe makes its closest pass on Friday. Rain arrived on Thursday afternoon, ahead of any wind. Philippe is expected to be a tropical storm as it swipes the island, so the risk of widespread damage is limited, but power outages are possible.",Weather
Hurricane Sandy Fast Facts," Here’s a look at Hurricane Sandy, which was also called “Superstorm Sandy.” According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states and all of the eastern seaboard.

How Tropical Storm Philippe could muck up weather in the Northeast this weekend," Tropical Storm Philippe is on track to deliver a dreary weekend to the Northeast, including a slug of tropical moisture which is raising the risk of flooding rainfall in an area that has been soaked repeatedly in recent weeks. The storm is still far from the US mainland and just north of the Caribbean. But its projected track has echoes of Hurricane Lee in September, when the much-weakened system brought strong winds and rain to parts of the Northeast and Canada. Philippe is expected to approach New England as a tropical storm on Sunday, but may lose some of its tropical nature as it approaches the coast. The severity of rain and wind will be the same regardless of whether it’s a tropical storm or a post-tropical storm at landfall. For now, portions of New England and eastern New York are most likely to experience heavy rain and potential flooding. A Level 2 of 4 slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday in these areas by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But the bull’s-eye of heaviest rainfall could shift if low pressure moving across the eastern US pulls Philippe closer to the Northeast. This potential shift could move the risk closer to the mid-Atlantic – an area where another deluge would be particularly worrisome. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible across New York and New England. Higher amounts closer to 2 to 4 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, likely in Maine. In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday night into Sunday as Philippe comes ashore. Philippe has quite a distance to travel before approaching the US and Canada but it will soon come in close contact with Bermuda. The island’s weather service issued a tropical storm warning Wednesday evening as Philippe closed in. Bermuda is only 15 miles across, so landfalls are rare. Only eleven systems have made landfall on the island since 1851, according to data from NOAA. But Philippe won’t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain. The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for the island on Wednesday, since Philippe won’t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are likely across Bermuda when Philippe makes its closest pass on Friday. Rain arrived on Thursday afternoon, ahead of any wind. Philippe is expected to be a tropical storm as it swipes the island, so the risk of widespread damage is limited, but power outages are possible.",Weather
Temperatures are about to come crashing down with a dramatic fall pattern change," A dramatic change is on the way as a robust cold front delivers the first hefty dose of fall weather by the weekend, sending temperatures tumbling by as much as 35 degrees. The cooldown is welcome news for millions in the South that have endured a brutally hot summer and a roasting start to fall. Relief from the heat will make it as far south as the Gulf Coast. States like Louisiana — which endured its hottest summer on record this year — will have below-normal afternoon temperatures for the first time since spring. The change will begin in portions of the Plains and Midwest that have been baking in record-breaking October heat since Saturday. Dozens of daily temperature records have fallen there, and some cities in Minnesota and Michigan smashed all-time October temperature records. While the most brutal heat will soon come to an end across the north-central US, summerlike heat is only beginning to build for the Northeast. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal October levels will be common through Thursday across the Great Lakes and Northeast. It won’t last for long. The coldest air of the season will arrive late this week and usher in conditions that haven’t been felt since early May across the northern US. A one-two punch of cold air from two separate cold fronts will surge across the central US starting Wednesday and expand into the eastern US Friday and through the weekend. High temperatures from the Great Lakes to New York could drop by as much as 35 degrees by the weekend. Temperature drops of 20 degrees will be more widespread. The first cold front will bring relief to states in the north-central US from Wednesday to Thursday. Places like Minneapolis, where record-breaking temperatures soared into the 90s on Sunday, may not make it out of the 60s on Wednesday. The second cold front will be much more potent and usher in the season’s first push of truly autumn air for the central and eastern US. Chilly, Canadian air will surge southward as the cold front digs across the eastern two-thirds of the continental US from Thursday to Sunday. Places like Detroit and Cleveland – that soar into the upper 80s on Wednesday – may not climb out of the low 50s on Sunday. Philadelphia and New York City will likely bask in the 80s through at least Wednesday, but by Sunday, high temperatures will struggle to reach the low 60s. Overnight low temperatures will also plummet behind these fronts. Low temperatures in the upper 30s to low 50s are likely across the north-central US and Midwest by Saturday morning, and in the Northeast by Sunday morning. The first frost of the season is possible for portions of northern states like North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin as temperatures drop into the low to middle 30s. Chilly fall weather should stick around early this month, especially in the eastern US. Below-average temperatures are likely from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast through at least the middle of next week, according to the Climate Prediction Center. The dramatic cooldown won’t be the only noticeable weather change this week. The clash between cold, autumnal air and steamy, summerlike air will create stormy weather. The storm threat on Wednesday will stretch from the southern Plains to the Midwest. Some storms may turn severe on Wednesday afternoon, mainly in Texas and Oklahoma. Any rain from these storms is sorely needed in Texas, where 80% of the state is experiencing at least moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. From Tuesday through Wednesday, 0.75 to 1.50 inches of rain could fall across much of the state, with higher amounts possible in areas worked over by multiple storms. Rain and thunderstorms will continue to march slowly eastward and impact portions of the eastern US Thursday and Friday, while wet weather continues in the Midwest. Periods of heavy rain are possible the Northeast over the weekend. Any heavy rainfall could pose an issue for parts of the region plunged underwater by flooding rainfall last week.",Weather
"Rest of hurricane season in ‘uncharted waters’ because of El Niño, record ocean temperatures"," Experts fear an already active hurricane season could come to an eventful and exceptional end as unusually warm, storm-boosting ocean temperatures and a slow-to-emerge El Niño combine. The Atlantic season and its 18 named storms has already been above average, according to Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher with Colorado State University. But October usually signals changes in activity and the areas where storms form. The first half of October is typically the final stretch of the busiest time of the Atlantic hurricane season. The number of storms usually begins to drop off quickly toward the end of October and craters by the time the season ends on November 30. Storms that do form typically do so in areas that are much too close for comfort – in the Gulf of Mexico, near the Bahamas and the western Caribbean – rather than in the open Atlantic, where storms like Category 5 Hurricane Lee formed earlier this year. This means places like Florida, which was devastated by Category 5 Hurricane Michael’s landfall in October 2018, need to be on particular guard in a normal October. However, extremely high sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic “expand the reach of where something might form” into the late season this year, Brian McNoldy, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Miami, told CNN. This could mean more storms develop late into the season in the main development region, a large section of the open Atlantic Ocean that stretches from Africa to the eastern Caribbean. If this were to happen, parts of the eastern Caribbean, Bermuda and the East Coast could still be at risk for tropical strikes. The battle between warm ocean water and the effect of El Niño has posed a forecasting challenge throughout this hurricane season, as one factor is seemingly negating the other. El Niño typically causes strong upper-level winds in the Atlantic, which suppress hurricane activity. But weaker upper-level winds – which are more favorable for hurricanes to develop – tend to be associated with warmer ocean temperatures, which is exactly what we have seen this year, Fischer explained. On balance, the warmer ocean temperatures and weaker winds are winning, and more storms have been able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year, Klotzbach previously told CNN. This clash is expected to continue into October and November. “Usually as we get into the back half of the hurricane season, El Niño tends to dominate, even if the Atlantic is warm. But we’ve just never seen anything this warm,” Michael Fischer, an Associate Scientist with the University of Miami, told CNN. This could leave the Atlantic open to more tropical activity in general through the rest of the season, according to Fischer, but it remains to be seen. “So we’re kind of in uncharted waters, if you will, and it’s tough to make any kind of confident forecast because of that,” Fischer told CNN. One thing is for certain, though: Any tropical system that does form would likely get an “extra boost” in strength from the exceptionally warm water, according to McNoldy. This has already been demonstrated by multiple storms this season, including Hurricane Idalia and Hurricane Lee – both of which rapidly intensified while moving over extremely warm water. It’s possible that upper-level winds will remain at abnormally low levels across the main development region and the Caribbean, where the effect of El Niño is typically most pronounced, according to Fischer. This, combined with high ocean temperatures, may leave nothing standing in the way of tropical development. “Is El Niño at some point going to say, ‘Forget this, I’m in charge?’” Klotzbach said. “I don’t see massive signs of that.” If conditions continue to be ripe for tropical development through the end of hurricane season, it’ll add onto what has already been an abnormal season. “There are a lot of things going on this year that are unusual” in the Atlantic, Klotzbach added. “We have an Atlantic that’s in a different kind of league from other years.”",Weather
"Canada’s wildfires set to shroud New York City, Northeast in smoky haze"," Smoke from wildfires still raging in Canada is expected to blanket part of the Northeast US on Monday, bringing a haze to cities in New York and Massachusetts, forecasters say. “Current forecasts indicate that a plume of wildfire smoke may reach New York City around sunrise Monday morning, causing noticeably hazy skies,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a warning to residents on Sunday. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation forecast moderate air quality conditions at 55 on its air quality index, alerting residents that have preexisting health conditions to take necessary precautions in light of the predicted air quality. “Wildfires in Canada continue to produce some smoke impacts in NYS and smoke at high altitudes may be visible downstate today into tomorrow, although fine particulate levels across eastern and northern NY will stay in the Good to Moderate range today as smoke clears,” a post from the agency on X – the platform formerly known as Twitter –  reads. Southern New England residents woke up to a dense fog Sunday morning and the National Weather Service said more hazy weather was “expected as wildfire smoke drifts in from Canada,” according to a post on X from NWS Boston. Cities like Boston and Providence are under “unhealthy for sensitive groups” or a level 3 of 6, according to CNN weather, but the forecast for much of the northeast is expected to be moderate, or a level 2 of 6, for Monday. Smoke could last into Tuesday, but no air quality alerts have been issued at this time. Meanwhile, Canadian officials forecast moderate air quality in Toronto Sunday evening into Monday morning, warning “people with heart and lung conditions” should take precautions as they will most likely be affected by the air quality. Smoke continues to impact regional air quality as Canada grapples with the worst wildfire season on record. In the northeast alone, there are currently more than 50 wildfires burning in Ontario and five active fires burning in Quebec.",Weather
"Record rain in New York City generates ‘life-threatening’ flooding, overwhelming streets and subways"," Record-setting rain overwhelmed New York City’s sewer system Friday, sending a surge of floodwater coursing through streets and into basements, schools, subways and vehicles throughout the nation’s most populous city. The water rose fast and furious, catching some commuters off guard as they slogged through Friday morning’s rush hour. First responders jumped into action where needed, plucking people from stranded cars and basements filling like bathtubs. More rain fell in a single day at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport – nearly 8 inches – than any other since 1948. A month’s worth of rain fell in Brooklyn in just three hours as it was socked by some of the storm’s most intense rainfall rates Friday morning. Track travel delays: NYC airports hammered with heavy rain and flooding The prolific totals are a symptom of climate change, scientists say, with a warmer atmosphere acting like a massive sponge, able to sop up more water vapor and then wring it out in intense spurts which can easily overwhelm outdated flood protections. “Overall, as we know, this changing weather pattern is the result of climate change,” Rohit Aggarwala, New York City’s Chief Climate Officer said in a Friday morning news conference. “And the sad reality is our climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can respond.” A widespread 3 to 6 inches of rain had fallen across the New York City by late Friday afternoon. More rain was set to fall through the evening and then gradually taper off. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley Friday morning as the worst of the flooding hit. In an interview with New York’s WNBC-TV, she urged residents to stay home because of widespread dangerous travel conditions. “This is a very challenging weather event,” Hochul said. “This a life-threatening event. And I need all New Yorkers to heed that warning so we can keep them safe.” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy also declared a state of emergency for his state Friday afternoon. Firefighters performed rescues at six basements in New York City flooded by torrents of water, according to the New York City Fire Department. The water also found its way into 150 of New York City’s 1,400 schools, which remained open on Friday, New York City school chancellor David Banks said at a news briefing. One school in Brooklyn evacuated when floodwater caused the school’s boiler to smoke, he said. “Our kids are safe and we continue to monitor the situation,” Banks said. Floodwater spilled into subways and onto railways and caused “major disruptions,” including suspensions of service on 10 train lines in Brooklyn and all three Metro-North train lines. Gov. Hochul said the city was deploying additional buses to help fill the gap caused by the train outages. Limited service resumed by Friday evening on the Metro-North lines. And the Metropolitan Transportation Authority fully restored service on seven subway lines by Friday evening, according to Demetrius Crichlow, senior vice president of the New York City Transit Department of Subways. “Today was just not an easy day for us but like New Yorkers, we are resilient, we continue to press on,” Crichlow said. MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said Friday evening one of three Metro-North Railroad lines was back up and running – the Hudson line – and noted the Long Island Railroad also has good service. The MTA also said it is working to restore limited service to the remaining two lines on Friday night. Air travel didn’t fair any better. Flight delays hit all three New York City area airports Friday. Flooding inside the historic Marine Air Terminal in New York’s LaGuardia Airport forced it to close temporarily. The terminal, which is the airport’s smallest and serves Spirit and Frontier airlines, was open again Friday night. Because of swollen rivers and creeks, some flood warnings were set to be in effect into Saturday morning in parts of Connecticut, New Jersey and southern New York, including along the Bronx River. Some flood warnings By late Friday, flood watches had expired for the region except in Suffolk County on Long Island in New York and parts of northwestern and southern Connecticut, where watches were set to be in effect until Saturday morning. The extreme rainfall rates produced prolific totals: • In Brooklyn: A month’s worth of rain, up to 4.5 inches, fell in only 3 hours on Friday morning, according to National Weather Service data. This three-hour rainfall total is only expected about once every 100 years in Brooklyn, according to NOAA estimates. • In Manhattan: Nearly 2 inches of rain fell in one hour in Central Park, the second-wettest hour there in 80 years. More than 5 inches of rain have fallen there so far. • In Queens: It’s the wettest day on record at John F. Kennedy International Airport, preliminary data from the National Weather Service shows. At least 7.88 inches of rain has fallen there since midnight.",Weather
High-impact flood event targets New York City through Friday," A high-impact flood event is taking shape for the New York City area as a coastal storm moves in overnight and threatens to dump prolific amounts of rain Friday. Millions of people in the New York tri-state area face a Level 3 of 4 “moderate” risk for flash flooding, the National Weather Service warned. Intense rainfall rates topping 1 inch an hour are possible throughout the day. Rainfall that intense could cause serious flash flooding on roads and even in subway stations. The rain will begin for many starting Thursday night, peaking on Friday and Friday night. New York City Emergency Management issued a travel advisory starting at 4 a.m. Friday through 6 a.m. Saturday, warning of potentially “widespread travel impacts” during the morning commute. “New York City will be under a flood watch starting tomorrow and we urge New Yorkers to prepare for heavy rain and potential flooding throughout Friday and Saturday morning,” NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol said. “All New Yorkers need to exercise caution. If you must travel, consider using public transportation and allow for extra travel time, and if you must drive, do not enter flooded roadways.” Iscol also warned of potential basement flooding, something that proved particularly deadly in the area when Hurricane Ida’s remnants wrung out epic amounts of rain two years ago. Widespread rainfall totals between 2 and 4 inches are expected, but those totals could climb to between 5 and 8 inches in spots where particularly intense bands of rain set up and linger. The bull’s-eye for the worst rain is from central New Jersey northward through Manhattan and Long Island and into southern Connecticut and the Hudson Valley. Flooding could happen even in areas that only receive one inch of rain, since the ground is already saturated across many areas of the Northeast from recent heavy rainfall. At least two inches of rain has fallen over the last seven days from Virginia through Massachusetts, with some areas picking up over four inches. The system will be very slow to exit the region this weekend, so more rain is expected on Saturday. The sun finally returns in full force on Sunday as rainfall-limiting high pressure returns to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. Another factor may exacerbate flooding across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic – a supermoon. The fourth and final supermoon of 2023 will occur Friday morning, creating more extreme tidal cycles that could increase the flood potential in communities along the East Coast. As a result, coastal flood advisories extend more than 300 miles from Bridgeport, Connecticut, through Virginia Beach. Up to one foot of inundation above ground level is expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways. The weather service warns some partial or full road closures are possible. Rip currents and very high surf are another concern. At least 76 people have died in rip currents so far this year, NOAA data shows.",Weather
The Mississippi River is starving for rain. Its prospects are grim," Water levels on the Mississippi River are nearing historic lows for the second consecutive year, triggering a drinking water emergency in Louisiana as ocean water flows upstream, unimpeded by the river’s uncharacteristically weak flow. With no substantial rain in the immediate forecast, levels are expected to drop to even more dire levels in the coming weeks, leading Louisiana’s governor to warn water woes there could stretch into January. Water gauges across a nearly 400-mile expanse of the Mississippi River from the mouth of the Ohio River to Jackson, Mississippi, are at or below a critical level, according to data from NOAA and the US Geological Survey, signaling widespread disruption to residents and industry along the river. All the gauges in the Memphis area are within the top five lowest levels on record, said Katie Dedeaux, a hydrologist for the National Weather Service in Memphis. Water levels for some gauges from southern Missouri to central Mississippi are expected to dip even further and fall below record levels by the middle of October. Lower Mississippi River water levels are forecast to continue to drop through at least mid-to-late October, according to Dedeaux. “We’re going to need a pretty significant period of wet weather across the basin,” Dedeaux told CNN, noting that this isn’t a situation where one heavy rain event can fix the problem. “It’s not going to be an overnight thing.” This could spell trouble for the tens of thousands of people in four Louisiana parishes, including New Orleans, whose water is threatened by salty ocean water pushing northward into water systems. In order to push the saltwater back, “10 inches of precipitation across the entire Mississippi Valley” is needed, according Col. Cullen Jones, commander of the Army Corps’ New Orleans office – relief that may not arrive until this winter. Water levels on the Mississippi River began to plummet in early September, well ahead of the October drop last year. The consecutive nature of these droughts has prevented the river from being able to recharge, Dedeaux told CNN. Meaningful rainfall was hard to come by for large swaths of the Mississippi River watershed over the summer due to a seemingly never-ending series of heat domes which fueled record-breaking temperatures and directed wet weather away from the southern and central US. Heat-fueled exceptional drought, which is the highest level defined by the US Drought Monitor, is in place across nearly one-fifth of the lower Mississippi River region – the second-largest area recorded there since 1999.  This summer was the hottest and the third-driest on record for Louisiana, where over 85% of the state is in severe or exceptional drought. Portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi and Louisiana ended the summer with a rainfall deficit of 2 to 8 inches under what typically falls during the course of the season, according to data from NOAA. Some parts of Louisiana even missed out on 10 or more inches of typical rainfall over the summer. The rainfall deficit at the southern end of the watershed can also be tied back in part to a lack of hurricane activity impacting the region the past two hurricane seasons. No tropical systems, which can dump large quantities of rain, have made landfall in Louisiana or Mississippi over the last two years. So even though October and November are typically when the Mississippi River is at its lowest levels, all of these factors fueled significant rainfall deficits across the Mississippi watershed which sent levels dramatically lower than normal, Alexis Highman of the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center told CNN. There are signs of relief in the longterm. A drought outlook recently released by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center forecasts improvement, but not elimination, of drought conditions by the end of the year across the Mississippi Valley. It also shows above-normal precipitation chances over the next three months across the South. An ongoing El Niño will partly drive this potential drought relief. El Niño winters often feature increases in precipitation across the South. But an El Niño winter may be a double-edged sword, as portions of the northern Plains and Midwest tend to say drier than average. Drier conditions may affect rivers which flow into the Mississippi River, like the Missouri and the Ohio, limiting the amount of water feeding into the Mississippi as a whole. Sixty percent of the water that flows into the lower Mississippi River comes from the Ohio River, while the other 40 percent comes from the upper Mississippi River, Dedeaux told CNN.",Weather
An El Niño winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US," Fall has only just begun, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially since this one may look drastically different than recent years because of El Niño. This winter will be the first in a few years to feel the effects of the phenomenon, which has a sizable impact on the weather during the coldest months of the year. El Niño is one of three phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which tracks water temperature changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that can have rippling effects on weather patterns around the globe. The El Niño phase occurs when these ocean temperatures are warmer than normal for an extended period. This year’s El Niño began in June, is expected to be strong this winter and last at least into early next spring, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. El Niño’s cooler counterpart, La Niña, played a huge role in the past three winters across the US, keeping the South dry while parts of the West received a lot of much-needed snow. Early winter predictions from the Climate Prediction Center have many of the hallmarks of typical El Niño winters, auguring changes to come. No two El Niño winters are the same, but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common. One of the major reasons is the position of the jet stream, which often shifts south during an El Niño winter. This shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the North becomes drier and warmer, according to NOAA. Because the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through, they can move across the South with increased frequency during an El Niño winter. More storms means more precipitation, typically from the southern Plains to the Southeast. This could be crucial for states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi plagued by drought. The combination of cooler weather and more frequent precipitation may also increase the chances for wintry precipitation like freezing rain, sleet and snow to fall in the South. El Niño typically leads to a milder winter in the North, from the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies, Plains and Midwest. Individual storms can still form and deliver bouts of brutal cold or heavy snow to these regions, but they are typically less frequent. This would be bad news for portions of the Midwest also dealing with extreme and exceptional levels of drought, and for snowpack in the Pacific Northwest – a key water source for the region. El Niño winter patterns are less regular in California, the Southwest and the Northeast. The frequency of storms and uptick in precipitation across California and portions of the Southwest may depend on the overall strength of the El Niño. A stronger El Niño may lead to more storms, low elevation rain and high elevation snow, while a weaker version could hang the Southwest out to dry. The Northeast doesn’t have a well-defined set of expectations during an El Niño winter. The region can be milder overall like its other northern counterparts, but it can also be at the mercy of robust coastal storms moving along the Atlantic Coast. Looking back at recent El Niño winters can also help visualize what the upcoming winter may have in store:",Weather
"Ophelia continues weakening as it moves up the East Coast, bringing heavy rain from North Carolina to New Jersey"," Ophelia, now a post-tropical cyclone, continues to weaken as it moves over the mid-Atlantic Sunday, leaving nearly nine million people from Long Island to Southern Maryland under coastal flood alerts. Areas from eastern Pennsylvania to just south of Long Island could see heavy rainfall Sunday, potentially leading to scattered instances of flash flooding. The National Weather Service warned flooding could be significant enough to close roads and threaten homes and businesses in some areas. The heavy rain will shift northeast on Sunday to over parts of New England and the Northern mid-Atlantic as a weakening Ophelia continues its trek up the East Coast, forecasters said. “The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable,” the Weather Prediction Center said. New York City issued a travel advisory through Sunday, warning of a “a long-duration rainfall event.” “While the warmer summer days are behind us, New Yorkers should take precautions regarding the forecast for high winds and rain during our first fall weekend,” said NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol. TRACK THE STORM New Yorkers who live in basement apartments in flood-prone areas were told to prepare to move to higher ground and avoid driving on flooded streets or entering flooded subway stations. A coastal flood warning was also issued Saturday for communities in New Jersey’s Atlantic City, where several roads were closed due to flooding. “With high tide right around now along the Atlantic coast, we are getting numerous reports from coastal communities of street flooding and road closures,” the weather service office in Mount Holly posted on X, formerly Twitter. Ophelia was a tropical storm at near-hurricane strength when it made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, early Saturday, knocking out power, flooding coastal streets and forcing rescues. States of emergency were declared in Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland. The storm weakened throughout the day and disbanded into a post-tropical low by Saturday night, with little change in strength forecast over the next couple of days. Now, Ophelia, with sustained winds of 35 mph, is expected to keep moving over southeastern Virginia and then over the Delmarva Peninsula Sunday, before dissipating Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. For now, Ophelia’s key threats include: As Ophelia started lashing North Carolina, storm surge flooded coastal areas and inlets in the state overnight with wind gusts of 73 mph hitting Cape Lookout, along the state’s Outer Banks. Five people, including three children, aboard an anchored sailing vessel were rescued from Lookout Bight Friday, officials said. The group were faced with 35 to 40 mph winds and 6-foot to 8-foot seas, according to the US Coast Guard. “The owner of the vessel did not feel comfortable in the channel and requested to be rescued,” the Coast Guard said. No one was injured. Meanwhile, some areas were dealing with storm surge, an abnormal rise of water generated by the storm. Residents of Washington, North Carolina, were warned to “avoid the downtown area” on Saturday as about 3 to 4 feet of storm surge from Ophelia sent waters over the city’s boardwalk area, a city Facebook post read. In New Bern, which sits along two rivers in North Carolina about 120 miles east of Raleigh, roads were flooded and water crept inland as the levels rose in the downtown area, city officials said on Facebook. Photos posted on the city’s social media page show a flooded children’s park and ducks swimming through flooded streets. Emergency crews in New Bern barricaded flooded areas of the city, including Union Point Park, which “looks like a lake,” city officials said Saturday morning. At one point Saturday, as many as 70,000 homes and businesses across North Carolina and Virginia lost power as winds battered the coast. Many of those customers had power restored by the end of the day, according to poweroutage.us.",Weather
Ophelia weakens to tropical depression as it dumps inches of rain along upper East Coast," Ophelia, now a tropical depression, is impacting parts of the mid-Atlantic after its landfall early Saturday near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, slammed the coast with heavy rain, strong winds and flooding. Here are the storm’s latest impacts: The then-tropical storm roared ashore around 6:15 a.m. with 70 mph sustained winds, just shy of hurricane strength. By 8 p.m., maximum sustained winds decreased to 35 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. It is expected to continue weakening. TRACK THE STORM All storm surge and tropical storm warnings were discontinued Saturday night as the storm lost strength. Coastal flooding warnings and wind advisories remained in effect for some parts of the East Coast, according to the hurricane center. Ophelia’s center is on track to move across southeastern Virginia through Saturday night before heading farther north across the Delmarva Peninsula by Sunday, the hurricane center said. The storm’s shield of rain extended hundreds of miles from its center and dumped heavy rain across a large swath of the mid-Atlantic, including Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. As Ophelia made its way up the East Coast Saturday evening, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood warning for communities in New Jersey’s Atlantic City, where several roads were closed due to flooding. “With high tide right around now along the Atlantic coast, we are getting numerous reports from coastal communities of street flooding and road closures,” the NWS office in Mount Holly posted on X, formerly Twitter. Coastal areas in North Carolina bore the brunt of impacts as the expansive storm’s center barged into the state earlier Saturday. Storm surge flooded coastal areas and inlets in North Carolina overnight and winds gusting to 73 mph hit Cape Lookout, along the state’s Outer Banks. The high winds and rain caused treacherous conditions off the coast of Cape Lookout, prompting the rescue of five people, including three children, from Lookout Bight Friday, officials said. The group had been aboard an anchored sailing vessel “that was beset by weather conditions” with 35 to 40 mph winds, according to a news release from the US Coast Guard. “The conditions at the time were 6-foot to 8-foot seas, with occasional 10-foot swells,” the Coast Guard release said. “The owner of the vessel did not feel comfortable in the channel and requested to be rescued,” the Coast Guard said. No one was injured. Residents of Washington, North Carolina, were warned to “avoid the downtown area” on Saturday as about 3 to 4 feet of storm surge from Ophelia sent waters over the city’s boardwalk area, a city Facebook post read. About 40 miles south in New Bern, which sits along two rivers in North Carolina about 120 miles east of Raleigh, roads were flooded and water crept inland as the levels rose in the downtown area, city officials said on Facebook. Photos posted on the city’s page show a flooded children’s park and ducks floating down the street on floodwaters. Emergency crews in New Bern barricaded flooded areas of the city, including Union Point Park, which “looks like a lake,” city officials said Saturday morning. The flooding began on Friday, when roads were submerged in communities along North Carolina’s coast. In coastal Cedar Island, water collected on Highway 12, though it was open and passable, the state transportation department said. “But please don’t go out tonight unless you absolutely have to. There is sand and water on the roadway, and it’s dark and stormy,” the department said in a social media post. Water levels also rose overnight in the Chesapeake Bay, along the coasts of Virginia and Maryland. “If you can avoid driving or being out during the storm please do so. We are expecting an extended period of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and elevated tides,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said. Ophelia will deliver several key threats through the weekend: Heavy Rainfall: Some places in north-central North Carolina through New Jersey could see between 1 and 3 inches of rain, with up to 5 inches possible in some isolated areas. Meanwhile, 1 to 3 inches of rain are also forecast across southeastern New York through southern New England beginning Saturday into Monday. Coastal Threats: Up to 3 feet of storm surge is possible in some coastal areas, particularly in the Hatteras Inlet along North Carolina’s Outer Banks, Delaware Bay and along Chesapeake Bay. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds, where the storm surge will be accompanied by dangerous waves, according to the hurricane center. The storm will also bring dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast through the weekend, the hurricane center warned. Strong and Gusty winds: Wind gusts and tropical storm conditions will continue to affect parts of the coast of North Carolina and Virginia through Saturday night. Severe weather: A few tornadoes are also possible in parts of the mid-Atlantic coast.",Weather
Tropical Storm Ophelia strengthens as it threatens East Coast with wet and windy weekend," Tropical Storm Ophelia has strengthened off the East Coast, Hurricane Hunter data shows, as North Carolina and parts of the mid-Atlantic prepare for a soggy and windy weekend ahead of the storm’s anticipated landfall. The storm, packing maximum sustained winds of 70 mph with higher gusts, is expected to affect areas hundreds of miles beyond its center with several inches of rain as it treks up the coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. A hurricane watch was issued for portions of eastern North Carolina, where water levels were rising along parts of the coast Friday night. Ophelia moved north-northwest toward the East Coast on Friday at 12 mph. The storm’s center is forecast to approach North Carolina’s coast Friday night, the National Hurricane Center stated in an update. “Some additional strengthening cannot be ruled out as Ophelia traverses the warm waters of the Gulf Stream on its approach to eastern North Carolina. While this does not seem like the most likely outcome and is not explicitly forecast, the increased risk warrants the issuance of a Hurricane Watch for a portion of the North Carolina coast,” the hurricane center said. Coastal areas will bear the brunt of the heaviest rains and wind, though inland residents will get storms, too. Ophelia is targeting a landfall in North Carolina Saturday, but by the time the storm’s journey is done, wind and rain will have reached as far north as southern New England. TRACK THE STORM Ophelia’s strong winds could knock out power in some places, especially along the coast. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper ordered a state of emergency for the entire state Friday as the storm was already lashing coastal areas. The order will help make it easier for emergency crews to respond to the storm. The heavy rain and wind affecting North Carolina and Virginia will worsen into the evening Friday and affect more areas as the storm approaches the coast, so tropical storm warnings stretch from just south of Charleston, South Carolina, to around the Maryland-Delaware state line. Storm surge watches and warnings stretch from Surf City, North Carolina, to the Chesapeake Bay. A few tornadoes are also possible in parts of the coastal mid-Atlantic. The greatest risk of heavy rain and flooding Friday into Saturday was expected in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia, where 3 to 5 inches are forecast. Areas where strong bands of thunderstorms develop could see as much as 7 inches of rain. A broad stretch of the mid-Atlantic into southern New England could see 2 to 4 inches of rainfall from late Friday through the weekend. Areas along the coast could also see hazardous storm surge and coastal flooding, strong rip currents and rough surf. One to 5 feet of surge is possible in some areas, particularly in inlets and rivers from around Surf City, North Carolina, to Manasquan Inlet on the New Jersey shore. The highest risk of storm surge flooding will coincide with Saturday high tides, particularly in a coastal area from New Jersey to the Virginia Tidewater. More than two dozen flood gauges across the area were forecast to hit moderate or major flood levels Saturday, which means homes and businesses closest to the coast could flood and roads could become impassable.",Weather
"Tropical storm warning issued for parts of East Coast ahead of weekend rain, wind risk"," A tropical storm warning has been posted for parts of the North Carolina and mid-Atlantic coasts for a developing storm that will bring gusty winds, heavy rain, dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding to areas from Florida to New England as it tracks north near the coast into this weekend. The area of low pressure, dubbed Potential Tropical Cyclone 16 by the National Hurricane Center, currently has 35 mph winds off the east coast of Florida. It’s expected to strengthen into a tropical storm by Friday as it approaches the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. Depending on when it is named, it could be called Ophelia or Philippe. The tropical storm warning was issued from just south of Wilmington, North Carolina, to the Maryland-Delaware state line. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive in North Carolina as soon as Friday, before pushing into the mid-Atlantic on Saturday. A storm surge watch was also issued for parts of the same stretch of coastline, with up to 4 feet of surge possible from Surf City, North Carolina, to the Virginia Tidewater. The storm was slowly coming together on Thursday and causing rain and storms to bubble to life over parts of Florida’s northeast coast and far southeastern Georgia. Breezy conditions also ramped up and caused worsening seas, but the storm’s worst will come this weekend. Widespread rain As the coastal storm becomes more organized on Friday, rainfall will shift into parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. Rain will stretch hundreds of miles from its center as it treks north through the weekend and drench portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day Saturday and even parts of New England by Saturday night. The heaviest rainfall will remain largely confined to areas close to the coast, but inland areas will still have to deal with stormy weather, which could disrupt outdoor plans. The greatest risk for heavy rain and flooding is expected in far eastern North Carolina, with totals of 4 to 6 inches likely. Two to 4 inches of rain on Saturday through Sunday could impact a much larger swath of the eastern US from central North Carolina to New Jersey and New York. Even southern New England and inland areas, like Pennsylvania, could see 1 to 2 inches of rain this weekend. Strong winds Wind speeds will also increase on Friday for coastal areas, gusting 30 to 40 mph, with higher gusts possible closer to the center of the storm. The strongest winds are expected to arrive Friday for portions of the Carolinas and spread northward through the rest of the mid-Atlantic later Friday into Saturday. These wind gusts, coupled with soaked ground, may bring down trees, which could cause property damage and power outages. Coastal threats As the storm treks north, the risk for dangerous rip currents will be elevated along much of the East Coast as it churns up hazardous seas. The weather service warned of a high risk for rip currents headed into the weekend for sections of the coastline from Florida to New Jersey. Coastal flooding is also possible for portions of North Carolina northward into New Jersey as the storm moves up the coast this weekend. Major-to-moderate flooding is forecast for several spots in the Virginia Tidewater and along Delaware Bay on Saturday as the storm’s strong winds push water into rivers at the coast. In spots where major flooding occurs, numerous roads and homes and businesses could be inundated, according to NOAA.",Weather
Coastal storm to deliver nasty weather from Florida to New England into this weekend," A storm set to form off the Southeast coast late this week will bring gusty winds, heavy rain and hazardous seas from Florida to New England as it tracks northward into the weekend. The area of low pressure, dubbed Potential Tropical Cyclone 16 by the National Hurricane Center, currently has 35 mph winds off the east coast of Florida. It’s expected to strengthen into a tropical storm by Friday as it approaches the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. Depending on when it is named, it could be called Ophelia or Philippe. The next two Atlantic storm names are Ophelia and Philippe. There is a 40 percent chance this area of low pressure organizes into a subtropical storm into the weekend, according to the hurricane center. A subtropical storm is a cyclone that is not fully tropical, but still has some characteristics found in a tropical storm. But the difference in overall impacts between the two are minimal, as subtropical storms still produce strong winds and can spread heavy rain well away from the storm’s center. The storm’s impacts to a wide swath of the Eastern Seaboard will also be the same, regardless of whether  it is named. Rain and thunderstorms are likely to soak parts of Florida’s northeast coast late Wednesday night and Thursday as the storm slowly comes together. Breezy conditions will also develop on Thursday and churn up surf along the Florida and Georgia coast. As the coastal storm becomes more organized on Friday, rainfall will shift north and eastward into parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. The greatest risk for heavy rain is expected in eastern North Carolina, where the National Weather Service in Morehead City warned that rainfall from Friday through weekend could be substantial, with widespread totals of 4 to 6 inches likely in the far eastern portion of the state. Prolonged, heavy rain could cause flooding, especially in low-lying or poor drainage areas. Wind speeds will also increase on Friday, gusting 30 to 40 mph in coastal areas from the Carolinas north to Delaware. These wind gusts, coupled with soaked ground, may bring down trees, which could cause property damage and power outages. Rain from the coastal storm will stretch hundreds of miles from its center and drench portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day Saturday and even parts of New England by Saturday night. The heaviest rainfall will continue to remain largely confined to areas close to the coast, but inland areas will still have to deal with stormy weather which could disrupt outdoor plans. As the storm treks north, the risk for dangerous rip currents will be elevated along much of the East Coast as it churns up hazardous seas.",Weather
Remnants of Lee move over northern Atlantic after bringing fierce winds and coastal flooding to Canada and northeast US," The remnants of post-tropical cyclone Lee were moving out over the ocean and away from Atlantic Canada on Monday, after US officials announced at least two deaths due to the storm. Lee, once a powerful hurricane, churned northward with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph on Sunday after making landfall Saturday on Long Island in Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane Center said in its final advisory about the storm. The storm knocked out power to tens of thousands and lashed the coasts of the northeastern US and Atlantic Canada with strong winds and waves. At least two deaths have been attributed to dangerous conditions associated with Lee. Officials in Fernandina Beach, Florida, announced a 15-year-old had drowned in the surf “due to turbulent wave conditions as a result of Hurricane Lee.” The boy was last seen Wednesday by witnesses holding onto a floating raft, “and then the raft got away from him,” Fernandina Beach Police Department Interim Police Chief Jeff Tambasco told CNN in an email, adding the teen’s body was recovered on Thursday. A 50-year-old Winterport, Maine, man died after a tree struck his vehicle during the storm Saturday, the Searsport Police Department said in a news release. Gary Phillips was on West Main Street in Searsport when a large tree branch broke due to high winds in the area at the time and struck the roof of the vehicle, the release said. Searsport is located approximately 30 miles south of Bangor. In Canada, about 50,000 customers were without power Sunday in Nova Scotia, while 8,000 in New Brunswick were in the dark, according to an outage maps by provincial utilities. In Maine – where winds of 83 mph were recorded in Perry, and 63 mph in Roque Bluffs – more than 20,000 homes and businesses were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. Outages there peaked Saturday with more than 90,000 customers in the dark, and photos from across the state showed toppled trees near homes and on roadways as powerful winds battered the area. Officials in New Brunswick cautioned residents to prepare for power outages and stock up on food and medication for at least 72 hours as they encouraged people to stay indoors during what they forecast would likely turn into a storm surge for coastal communities. “Once the storm starts, remember please stay at home if at all possible,” Kyle Leavitt, director of New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization, said Friday ahead of the storm. “Nothing good can come from checking out the big waves and how strong the wind truly is.” In the US, states of emergency were declared ahead of the storm in Maine and Massachusetts. President Joe Biden authorized the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to step in to coordinate disaster relief and assistance for required emergency measures. Boston’s Logan International Airport saw a spike in flight cancellations Saturday with 23% of all flights into Boston and 24% of flights originating out of the city canceled, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",Weather
"Post-tropical cyclone Lee makes landfall in Nova Scotia, forecast to bring strong wind gusts and rain as it moves inland"," Now a post-tropical cyclone, Lee made landfall on the far western tip of Nova Scotia on Saturday afternoon as it churned 65 mph sustained winds to parts of southeastern New England and Atlantic Canada, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm made landfall on Long Island in Nova Scotia around 4 p.m. Atlantic Time (3 p.m. ET). It will move across the Bay of Fundy and move inland around Maine and the New Brunswick, Canadian border on Saturday evening. Lee is forecast to weaken within hours after its landfall, but it will still be capable of heavy rains, coastal flooding and high winds as it tracks across the region overnight and early Sunday. More than 200,000 residents across Maine and Canada’s New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are experiencing power outages. A tropical storm warning is in effect for some areas. Utility power crews are in the field assessing damages and actively responding to downed utility lines and other damage caused by the storm. States of emergency have been declared in Maine and Massachusetts. President Biden has authorized the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to step in to coordinate disaster relief and assistance for required emergency measures. Lee had maximum sustained wind speeds of 70 mph, according to an update from the National Hurricane Center, which is equivalent to tropical storm-force winds. Tropical storm-force winds currently extend outward over 300 miles. An observation in Knox County, Maine, recently reported a wind gust of 63 mph. In addition to ferocious winds, Lee was expected to unleash up to six inches of rain in far northern Maine on Saturday, with neighboring New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island also at risk of seeing heavy precipitation. As the New England coast feels the effects, Boston’s Logan International Airport saw a spike in flight cancellations Saturday morning. According to the flight tracking website FlightAware, 23% of all flights into Boston and 24% of flights originating out of the city have been canceled Saturday, for a total of more than 117 flight cancellations so far. At the coast from the Long Island Sound north through Maine, flooding of 1 to 3 feet above ground level is possible if Lee’s storm surge coincides with high tide, according to National Hurricane Center director Michael Brennan. National Hurricane Center deputy director Jamie Rhome warned that people should avoid driving near shores and urged them to stay home to ride out the storm. He also noted there’s a high rip current risk extending from southern Florida stretching thousands of miles north to Maine. “The waves from this big hurricane produce a current that goes out to sea and will pull you out,” Rhome said Friday evening in a brief video update. “So, if you’re going to go to the beach this weekend, swim near a lifeguard.” In anticipation of those dangerous waves, local officials in Toms River, New Jersey, barred swimming this weekend at Ortley Beach, according to a news release from the township. Violators may be ticketed. “Lifeguards will be on duty Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. to enforce the Red Flag ban on swimming. The beach itself will be open,” officials said in a news release Friday. Meanwhile in Canada, officials in New Brunswick cautioned residents to prepare for power outages and stock up on food and medication for at least 72 hours as they encouraged people to stay indoors. “Once the storm starts, remember please stay at home if at all possible,” said Kyle Leavitt, director of New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization. “Nothing good can come from checking out the big waves and how strong the wind truly is. Not only are you putting yourself at risk, but you are putting at risk the lives of the emergency services personnel who may have to assist you.”",Weather
"Hurricane Lee on track to swipe parts of New England with gusty winds, power outages and high surf"," Hurricane Lee, an enormous Category 1 storm whipping strong winds across hundreds of miles, is inching closer to New England and expected to impact the region Friday evening into Saturday. Lee is so huge that its tropical-storm-force winds (between 39 and 74 mph) extend more than 300 miles from the center – well outside the National Hurricane Center’s forecast cone, which indicates where the center could track. Though Lee is not expected to make landfall in New England, the storm’s heavy rain could trigger isolated inland flooding, high surf could cause coastal flooding, and powerful wind gusts could knock out electricity. “We’re going to start to see those direct impacts start to move into portions of southeastern New England as early as later this afternoon, this evening, and then spread northward up into Maine overnight tonight and into Saturday,” National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said Friday. “The big story with Lee is just that it’s a large hurricane.” As of 8 p.m. ET Friday, Hurricane Lee was centered about 300 miles southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, the National Hurricane Center said. It was traveling north-northeast at 20 mph, whipping maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. “So even though the center is expected to stay offshore of the coast of southeastern New England,” Brennan said, “those tropical-storm-force winds are going to move into places (in Massachusetts) like Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket as we get later into today and tonight, and then spread northward along the coast of New England and up into Atlantic Canada overnight tonight and early Saturday.” Lee’s winds could cause power outages and isolated flooding – especially in areas where the ground is already saturated from recent rain. “There’s leaves still on the trees in New England. There is wet soil. So there’s going to be the potential for tree damage, power outages,” Brennan said. At the coast, flooding of 1 to 3 feet above ground level is possible if Lee’s storm surge coincides with high tide from the Long Island Sound north through Maine, Brennan said. Lee will “approach the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada today and Saturday,” the hurricane center said. “Lee is then expected to turn toward the north-northeast and northeast and move across Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.” Along the way, Lee could deluge some communities with a combination of rain, storm surge and high tide. “A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding within the wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds,” the National Hurricane Center said. “Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.” On Saturday, hurricane-strength winds (at least 74 mph) are possible from the northern coast of Maine into portions of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. But tropical storm-force wind gusts are possible across a much larger area of New England and Atlantic Canada. In Canada, Provincial and wildlife parks in Nova Scotia are closed Friday as Lee inches closer to the area. “Safety is our priority as we prepare for storm conditions forecast for the weekend,” said Tory Rushton, provincial minister of natural resources and renewables. “We are closing our parks for the storm and will reopen when it is safe.” Lee is expected to dump its heaviest rain – up to 6 inches – over far northern Maine on Saturday. Neighboring New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island could also see several inches. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the coasts of Massachusetts all the way north through Maine, including the popular island destinations of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket off the coast of Massachusetts. The warning extends further north into Canada. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey declared a state of emergency Friday as coastal parts of the state prepared for strong wind, heavy rain and flooding. And Maine Gov. Janet Mills declared a state of emergency Thursday, requesting federal aid in preparation for the storm’s arrival.",Weather
Hurricane Lee lashing Bermuda before striking coastal New England and Atlantic Canada," Hurricane Lee unleashed strong winds and tropical storm conditions on Bermuda ahead of a track that will bring heavy rain, wind and coastal flooding to coastal New England and Atlantic Canada on Friday and through the weekend. After days of uncertainty, there’s little time left for Lee’s track to change considerably, and confidence has grown now that the massive storm has completed its long-awaited northward turn and begun to pick up its pace. Lee is expected to track far enough away from the East Coast to avoid delivering a substantial blow to a more widespread and inland area of New England, but will still affect the coast ahead of a weekend landfall somewhere between northeast Maine and the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Parts of the East Coast were already feeling the storm’s effects Thursday, including “dangerous surf and rip current conditions,” according to the National Hurricane Center. Maine Gov. Janet Mills declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon and requested federal assistance in preparation for Lee’s arrival. Lee’s core was about 185 miles west of Bermuda as of Thursday night and was churning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph – a Category 1 hurricane – according to the hurricane center. An island-wide tropical storm warning is in effect for Bermuda as Lee tracks west of the island. Power outages mounted across Bermuda on Thursday afternoon as Lee’s winds battered the island, according to the island’s utility provider. Winds gusted up to 51 mph at Bermuda’s L.F. Wade International Airport. Hurricane and tropical storm watches have been issued for many of New England’s coastal residents in anticipation of the colossal storm’s impact on Friday and through the weekend. A tropical storm warning issued along New England’s coast was extended northward to the US and Canada border, the hurricane center said in a 5 p.m. advisory. And a tropical storm warning in effect for the coast of Massachusetts was extended westward to Westport, according to the advisory. Though the storm is expected to weaken as it approaches land, it will still have a massive radius of damaging winds that could pound coastal New England and Canada’s Atlantic provinces. As of Thursday night hurricane-force winds extended up to 105 miles from its center and tropical storm-force winds stretched for up to 345 miles, according to the hurricane center. Hurricane-strength winds are possible from the northern coast of Maine into portions of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on Saturday. Tropical storm-force wind gusts are possible across a much larger area of New England and Atlantic Canada. These strong winds will contribute to storm surge flooding up to 3 feet that could inundate parts of the southeast Massachusetts coast late Friday and Saturday. Heavy rainfall could pose a flood threat to some already rain-drenched areas of the Northeast, where saturated ground may be particularly susceptible to flash flooding. Lee’s heaviest rain will fall over portions of Maine Saturday, but states like New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are not completely in the clear. Lee could deliver 1 to 2 inches of rain from Rhode Island to northern Maine, while 2 to 4 inches of rain can fall across the Massachusetts Cape and much of Maine. Repeated downpours may bring up to 6 inches of rain to southeastern Maine. The softened soil combined with stiff wind gusts will also increase the likelihood of downed trees, which in turn could knock out essential power lines and cause outages. Areas at and near the coast, which will feel the strongest of Lee’s winds, will be the most at risk of wind damage and power outages.",Weather
Earthquakes Fast Facts," Here’s a look at earthquakes worldwide. The US Geological Survey describes an earthquake as “the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Stresses in the earth’s outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.” Earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the Earth after an earthquake strikes. Scientists used the Richter Scale for many years to measure earthquakes but now largely follow the “moment magnitude scale,” which USGS says is a more accurate measure of size.

Massive Hurricane Lee prompts tropical storm and hurricane watches for coastal New England as threat grows," Hurricane and tropical storm watches are now in effect for much of coastal New England as Hurricane Lee threatens to deliver a blow to parts of the region as well as Atlantic Canada later this week and into the weekend. “Hurricane conditions, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding are possible in portions of eastern Maine on Saturday,” the National Hurricane Center said. A hurricane watch has been issued for that area, it said. Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday urged residents to “exercise caution and to take common-sense steps to ensure they have all they need to stay safe as the storm draws closer.” The hurricane center also warned there is potential for “life-threatening storm surge flooding” in parts of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and Nantucket late Friday and Saturday. A storm surge watch has been issued there. A hurricane watch has been issued from Stonington, Maine, up to the US-Canada border, as well as for parts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for a large part of coastal New England, the center added. Lee’s winds could arrive as early as Friday evening for portions of New England and the Canadian Atlantic seaboard. The massive storm, which remained a Category 2 hurricane Wednesday evening, was centered about 345 miles south-southwest of Bermuda, according to an 11 p.m. ET advisory from the hurricane center. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for Bermuda ahead of Lee’s brush with the island Thursday. Bermuda is expected to feel tropical storm conditions by early Thursday, the center said. “On the forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night and then approach the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday,” it added. Lee will weaken, but the storm’s impacts beyond its center will be significant because of its colossal size, which has grown considerably since the weekend. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds extend out up to 265 miles. And that’s why a weaker storm isn’t less hazardous. A larger storm carries the potential to impact a more widespread area, increasing the likelihood that Lee will affect New England. And the waterlogged region is particularly susceptible to damage from strong winds and additional rainfall. “It’s dramatic, and I think it’s intimidating for anybody, any coastal areas that might be affected by the storm,” Lt. Cmdr. Josh Rannenberg, who is flying through Hurricane Lee, told Erin Burnett Wednesday evening. “Normally, when a major hurricane, that I’ve seen, makes landfall, a lot of the … severe damage can be relatively localized. When a storm spreads out like this, it can be intimidating in the sense that the damage is going to be much more widespread.” Regardless of its exact track, the storm’s impacts are expected to be widespread in New England, even if it doesn’t make landfall. “Due to Lee’s large size, hazards will extend well away from the center, and there will be little to no significance on exactly where the center reaches the coast,” the hurricane center has said. The soil across much of New England is already soaked.  Rainfall in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire is more than 300% above normal values over the past two weeks, according to weather service data. Destructive flooding already occurred in parts of Massachusetts earlier this week. More rainfall this week ahead of Lee will prime the environment for flash flooding, so even moderate amounts of rain from Lee could be dangerous. The combination of tropical storm-force wind gusts and saturated soil will also bring down trees more easily, especially since trees across New England are still in full leaf. This raises the risk of a higher number of power outages across the region. Meanwhile, dangerous surf is affecting the southeastern US coast from Florida through the Carolinas. The risk of rip currents now spans the East Coast from Florida to coastal Massachusetts.",Weather
‘Catastrophic flooding’ damages hundreds of homes as a Massachusetts city engulfed in water is now at risk of dam failure," Massachusetts cities devastated by floodwater could face new perils as more rain is on the way and officials wonder whether a “very sensitive” dam in will hold up. Gov. Maura Healey has declared a state of emergency across Massachusetts on Tuesday due to “catastrophic flooding” that began Monday and inflicted damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure, including bridges, dams and railways. About a dozen homes in the town of North Attleborough were completely under water Tuesday, said Chris Coleman, the town’s fire and emergency management chief. And about 200 homes were damaged in and around North Attleborough after a storm Monday quickly dumped about 5 inches of rain on ground already saturated from a weekend storm, officials said. “It was really scary, the amount of water that fell in just a short amount of time and the incredible devastation that it caused,” the governor said. No civilian injuries have been reported from the North Attleborough flooding, but a firefighter was injured overnight and was in stable condition, Coleman said Tuesday. She also said the massive flooding that hit various regions of Massachusetts “severely impacted” two dams, damaged railroad tracks and forced a number of seniors to be evacuated by boats in the middle of the night. “One of those dams has been shored up already and the other will be shored up by the end of the day,” said Healey, who toured the damage on Tuesday. Leominster was another city in Massachusetts to face a torrential downpour this week. The city got pummeled by roughly 11 inches of rain in just six to seven hours, Mayor Dean Mazzarella said Tuesday. Some basements in Leominster “probably have feet of water inside of them,” Mazzarella said. “We have several homes where the water washed out … you can see the foundation of the home.” While no serious injuries have been reported, the mayor said, “We had to evacuate people last night … with hovercrafts and boats to get people out to safety.” Leominster was quickly inundated not just by torrential downpours, but also from water gushing downhill. “Leominster is about 26 square miles. We have 12 hills, and obviously from those hills comes the water,” the mayor said. “And with 11 inches of rain, it just adds to the … water (going) downhill.” The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency has urged some residents to evacuate due to “a potential issue at the Barrett Park Pond Dam,” MEMA said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This particular dam is one that we’re actually about to replace,” Mazzarella said. “It is very sensitive. It’s water saturated. And we’re worried about that downstream. So, we’ve put out a code red and notified everyone along that stream bank, along that river base … to evacuate.” And it’s not clear when children in Leominster will be able to go back to school. “Our schools are closed” Tuesday, the mayor said. “We have a couple of schools that experienced severe damage and flooding. And the other schools are open for shelters.” The deluge has also washed away roads and created a large sinkhole, Mazzarella said. “That was the road … it’s gone,” the mayor said in a Facebook video showing the massive sinkhole. Videos posted on social media showed vehicles submerged by dark floodwater covering a highway. Other footage shows emergency vehicles trying to navigate a street overtaken by rapidly moving water as rain keeps falling. Another video shows water filling a gaping sinkhole in the middle of a street lined with houses. The torrent was so intense that a packed, 8-foot by 8-foot dumpster traveled down a local river and ended up in the middle of a riverwalk trail, Mazzarella said. Officials have no idea where the dumpster came from. While the rain has largely subsided in Leominster, “it’s going to take a while for the rivers to reach their peak,” Mazzarella said Tuesday morning. Treacherous flooding also overwhelmed the area around Providence, Rhode Island, Monday night, where residents were under a flash flood warning. Rescue crews there helped at least 30 people who had become trapped in cars and buildings as the waters rose, the mayor’s office told CNN. No residents were reported injured. While the impacted regions get a reprieve from heavy rain Tuesday, but another round of storms could move through Wednesday. Most of the Northeast – including central Massachusetts – faces a slight risk of excessive rainfall late Wednesday and early Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. And more rain could thrash Massachusetts and eastern New England this weekend, depending on the track of Hurricane Lee. The governor said local and state agencies are working to address damages in zones impacted by the storms and that her office is preparing an emergency declaration that will be issued later Tuesday.",Weather
A significantly larger Hurricane Lee will keep growing as it races north," Hurricane Lee grew even larger on Tuesday and triggered a tropical storm watch for Bermuda as the cyclone’s potential impacts begin to come into focus for the island and beyond. Lee, a Category 3 hurricane Tuesday night, was about 515 miles south-southwest of Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm has been growing in size since the weekend and hurricane-force winds now extend 125 miles from Lee’s center, according to the 8 p.m. ET hurricane center update. Tropical storm-force winds extended 240 miles from its core late Tuesday, having grown 55 miles in 12 hours. Lee is expected to remain quite strong through Tuesday night, but will lose some intensity Wednesday into Thursday as it moves over slightly cooler waters churned up by Hurricane Franklin earlier this month. But while Lee loses some strength this week, the hurricane will simultaneously continue to grow in size and begin to move faster. A larger storm could impact a more widespread area, even if its winds no longer reach monster hurricane levels. A larger Hurricane Lee, then, is more likely to affect the Eastern Seaboard – even if not through a direct landfall. Tropical storm-force winds could extend over 300 miles from Lee’s center later this week, National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a Monday storm briefing. This means potentially-damaging wind gusts could still impact portions of the northeastern US at the end of the week, even if the Lee’s center stays a couple hundred miles off the coast, out over the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical storm-force wind gusts could arrive for portions of Connecticut and eastern Massachusetts Friday night when Lee’s center is expected to be about 250 miles to the southeast. The exact timing and extent of Lee’s winds and rainfall in the US and Canada could still fluctuate with lingering uncertainty over its track. But the hurricane’s track may come into better focus once it turns to the north Wednesday. Regardless of its final track, the storm will send big waves to a growing area of the East Coast throughout the week as it tracks northward. This will cause coastal erosion, dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents at beaches. Dangerous surf was already happening along the southeastern US coast from Florida through the Carolinas and on many of the far eastern Caribbean islands as well as the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas and Bermuda. A high risk of rip currents was in effect through at least Wednesday night for coastal areas from Florida northward to Massachusetts. Rip currents have already killed 71 people in the US this year, preliminary National Weather Service data shows. Three people in New Jersey died in rip currents kicked up in the wake of Hurricane Franklin last week. Lee is expected to take a turn to the north on Wednesday and pick up its pace. The hurricane is set to make its closest approach to Bermuda Thursday into Friday and unleash strong winds and rain as well as dangerous surf and rip currents. The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the island, meaning tropical storm conditions are possible there in the next 48 hours. Tropical storm-force wind gusts are likely to whip across Bermuda from Thursday morning into Friday as Lee passes to the west. Rain could also fall heavily at times during this period and may cause localized flash flooding. Seas around the island will become hazardous with large waves as Lee approaches.",Weather
Exceptionally warm Atlantic has been ‘rocket fuel’ for a hyperactive hurricane season. But it’s not over," The Atlantic hurricane season typically reaches its peak this week, but record-warm ocean temperatures are fueling a hyperactive season that experts say shows no signs of slowing. The average hurricane season starts June 1 and runs through November 30, but its statistical peak is on September 10. So far this year, hurricane activity has been above average in every respect, according to Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. “It’s been a pretty busy season,” Klotzbach told CNN. “It’s not a slam dunk, but it’s looking like the season is going to be classified as above-normal.” Some fast facts on 2023 hurricanes so far: Before it started, forecasters predicted an average season, but warned of more uncertainty than usual because of a climatic battle between a burgeoning El Niño and warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures. El Niños tend to produce more wind shear – upper-level winds that can rip storms apart – but warm water can fuel their growth. Then, as the season started, ocean warmth skyrocketed to record levels and forecasters warned of explosive tropical development and a more active season, something that has come to fruition. “We saw how hot the Atlantic was and said, ‘Alright, we gotta go for it,’” said Klotzbach, whose research group creates seasonal hurricane forecasts. “Thankfully, we have a strong El Niño,” Klotzbach said, because if there was no El Niño, the season would “probably be tracking 200% of normal instead of 130% of normal.” But Klotzbach said this El Niño, which by all measures is considered strong, isn’t affecting the western Atlantic like it normally would. “Because the Atlantic is so warm, you’re not getting as much shear as you would normally get,” Klotzbach told CNN. “The entire basin is hot. If you compare it to 2005 or 2010, other big years the Atlantic had where it was really warm, we’re in a whole different ballgame this year.” The extreme ocean heat and low wind shear are having some major effects on the season, Klotzbach said. More storms are able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year. Even the storms that have been weakened by moderate shear – like hurricanes Franklin and Lee – were able to stay alive and restrengthen once they found more favorable conditions. “If we leave a storm out there long enough, eventually it’s going to find somewhere where the shear isn’t that strong” and it can strengthen, Klotzbach said. More frequent rapid intensification and more major hurricanes are also byproducts of this season’s ripe conditions. Idalia, Franklin and Lee all rapidly intensified in water running well above normal. “Warm water is not the only thing you need, but it does kind of load the dice toward these high-end rapid intensification events,” Klotzbach said. “You look at the water Lee was tracking over, it should have been at 28 degrees Celsius instead they’re 30 (degrees Celsius) – it’s like rocket fuel.” The season isn’t over yet – 90% of hurricane season activity happens from mid-August until mid-October – and Klotzbach said the next two weeks still look like they could produce more storms. Beyond that point, it’s anyone’s guess, Klotzbach said, but an Atlantic tinderbox has already proven full of surprises this season. “At the end of the day we’ve learned even in a strong El Niño, if you get the Atlantic warm enough it can hold its own,” Klotzbach said.",Weather
"Hurricane Lee forecast to get larger, increasing the risk to land in its uncertain path"," Major Hurricane Lee will continue to grow in size after a crucial northward turn midweek which will determine the extent and severity of its impact on the Northeast, New England, Bermuda and Canada. Lee was a Category 3 hurricane on Monday, located well north of the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, according to the 5 p.m. ET update from the National Hurricane Center. It is expected to weaken, grow in size and speed up after it makes its northward turn in the coming days. Although it may be weaker, a larger storm has the potential to impact a more widespread area, increasing the likelihood that Lee will affect the Eastern Seaboard – even it’s not in the form of a direct landfall. “Even as the peak winds come down, the wind field of Lee is going to continue to grow in size,” National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a Monday storm briefing. “We could see the tropical storm-force winds expand by 50 to 60 to 70%.” As of Monday, hurricane-force winds extended 75 miles from Lee’s center, up from 45 miles on Sunday. Tropical storm-force winds extended 185 miles from its core. Those tropical storm-force winds could extend over 300 miles from Lee’s center later this week, Brennan said. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty as to the exact track of how close it will get to the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada over the next several days,” Brennan said, “but certainly the chance for significant impacts with a growing storm.” Lee’s exact track, even if it stays off the coast of the US, will be crucial. The storm’s the large wind field means that oscillations east or west will affect the storm’s severity on land. Even if Lee stays a couple hundred miles off the coast, it could still lash the coast with strong winds, rain and coastal flooding. The final track of the storm after it passes by Bermuda on Thursday or Friday remains highly uncertain because its current slowdown is also delaying key forecast details. Exactly when, where and how fast Lee makes its northward turn will determine how close it tracks to the East Coast on its nearest approach over the weekend – details that could come more into focus as soon as Wednesday. If Lee tracks farther to the west before its northward turn, areas north of the Carolinas – particularly eastern New England and Atlantic Canada – could be more at risk of rain, wind and coastal flooding. If the storm turns more abruptly, it would track more to the east and lessen the risk to the entire Eastern Seaboard. Bermuda could be spared a direct hit, but may still experience strong winds and heavy rain as Lee tracks just to its west. Brennan said watches could be issued for the island as soon as Tuesday. Regardless of its final track, the storm will send big waves to a growing area of the East Coast throughout the week as it tracks northward off the coast. This will cause coastal erosion, dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents at beaches. Dangerous surf was already happening along the Florida coast and on many of the far eastern Caribbean islands as well as the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispanola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas and Bermuda. Rip currents have already killed 71 people in the US this year, preliminary National Weather Service data shows. Three people in New Jersey died in rip currents kicked up in the wake of Hurricane Franklin last week. Lee, which was a Category 1 storm Thursday, intensified with exceptional speed into rare Category 5 status as it moved west across the Atlantic, more than doubling its wind speeds to 165 mph in just a day.",Weather
Hurricane Lee restrengthens to Category 3 as East Coast faces hazardous beach conditions this week," Hurricane Lee has strengthened back into a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, satellite pictures and data from a hurricane hunter plane indicated Sunday. The powerful storm, which has fluctuated in intensity throughout its time over the open Atlantic, is expected to become a very dangerous Category 4 by late Sunday or early Monday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. “Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to reach portions of the southeast (United States) East Coast and are forecast to worsen and spread northward along much of the US East Coast during the next couple of days,” the National Hurricane Center said in an update Sunday. Lee is forecast to slow down considerably as it moves well north of Puerto Rico, the British and US Virgin Islands and the northern Leeward Islands, but it will have an impact there and on other Caribbean islands. It remains too early to determine its long-term track for later this week and how significant the impacts could be for northeastern US states, Bermuda and Atlantic Canada. By midweek, Lee will make a turn to the north, eventually moving between Bermuda and the US East coast late this week. The East Coast is bracing for the same kind of large swells and rip currents that the Caribbean is facing now. “Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser Antilles,” the National Hurricane Center warned Friday night. The British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas and Bermuda also face swells this weekend that can bring life-threatening surf and rip conditions. Waves breaking at 6 to 10 feet were forecast for Sunday, according to the National Weather Service office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Larger waves were expected this week along east- and north-facing beaches. “Beach erosion and coastal flooding is possible,” the office posted on social media. Lee, which was a Category 1 storm Thursday, intensified with exceptional speed into Category 5 status as it moved west across the Atlantic, more than doubling its wind speeds to 165 mph in just a day. Lee, which was a Category 1 storm Thursday, intensified with exceptional speed into Category 5 status as it moved west across the Atlantic, more than doubling its wind speeds to 165 mph in just a day. Vertical wind shear and an eyewall replacement cycle – a process that occurs with the majority of long-lived major hurricanes – has since led to the weakening of the storm, the hurricane center said. Hurricane Lee strengthened back into a Category 3 hurricane Sunday afternoon over the open Atlantic, and it’s starting to send dangerous rip currents to parts of the southeast US coast even as the storm’s longer-term path and effects are uncertain, forecasters said. Lee, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, was centered Sunday night over the ocean about 310 miles north of the Caribbean’s northern Leeward Islands and headed northwest, the National Hurricane Center said in an 11 p.m. ET Sunday advisory. The powerful storm, which has fluctuated in intensity throughout its time over the Atlantic, could become a Category 4 by Monday morning before fluctuating again later in the week, forecasters said. It remains too early to determine Lee’s long-term track for later this week and how significant the impacts could be for northeastern US states, Bermuda and Atlantic Canada. But the storm already was generating swells that were affecting many of the far eastern Caribbean islands as well as the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispanola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas and Bermuda. Those swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents, the hurricane center said Sunday. And “dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to reach portions of the southeast US East Coast and are forecast to worsen and spread northward along much of the US East Coast during the next couple of days,” the hurricane center said in the 11 p.m. ET Sunday advisory. The storm grew larger – though not stronger – Sunday evening. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 75 miles from center by 11 p.m. ET, the hurricane center said – up from 45 miles six hours earlier. By midweek, Lee is expected to make a turn to the north, likely moving between Bermuda and the US East coast late this week. The East Coast is bracing for the same kind of large swells and rip currents that the Caribbean is facing now.

Vertical wind shear and an eyewall replacement cycle – a process that occurs with the majority of long-lived major hurricanes – then led to the weakening of the storm, the hurricane center said. Computer model trends for Lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north this week. But exactly when that turn occurs and how far west Lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the US. Several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close Lee will get to the East Coast. An area of high pressure over the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda High, will have a major influence on how quickly Lee turns. A strong Bermuda High would keep Lee on its current west-northwestward track and slow it down a bit. As the high pressure weakens this week, it will allow Lee to start moving northward. Once that turn to the north occurs, the position of the jet stream – strong upper-level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane’s path – will influence how closely Lee is steered to the US. Lee could make a quick turn to the north early this week if high pressure weakens significantly. If the jet stream sets up along the East Coast, it will function as a barrier that prevents Lee from approaching the coast. This scenario would keep Lee farther away from the US coast but could bring the storm closer to Bermuda. Lee could make a slower turn to the north because the high pressure remains robust, and the jet stream sets up farther inland over the Eastern US. This scenario would leave portions of the East Coast, mainly north of the Carolinas, vulnerable to a much closer approach from Lee.",Weather
"Powerful Hurricane Lee will create hazardous conditions along the East Coast, regardless of its uncertain final track"," Hurricane Lee remains hundreds of miles east of the Caribbean late Saturday, yet forecasters say the storm’s effects may have an impact on the US Atlantic seaboard as early as this weekend. Lee was 285 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands as of 11 p.m. ET Saturday, whipping up maximum sustained winds of 105 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Category 2 hurricane, which earlier reached Category 5 status, is expected to maintain its strength Saturday and restrengthen over the weekend. It’s still too early to determine whether the core of the storm will directly impact the US mainland, but Lee is expected to rip currents and large waves to most of the East Coast of the United States on Sunday and Monday and worsen through the week, the hurricane center said. “Hazardous beach conditions expected to develop around the western Atlantic through next week,” the hurricane center said Saturday night. Caribbean islands will be similarly impacted by the storm as it moves slowly northwest through the Atlantic. Lee is expected to pass “well to the north” of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the northern Leeward Islands, forecasters said. “Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser Antilles,” the hurricane center warned Friday night. The British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas and Bermuda will also face swells this weekend that can bring life-threatening surf and rip conditions. The National Weather Service office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said waves breaking at 6 to 10 feet were forecast for Sunday. Larger waves were expected next week along east- and north-facing beaches. “Beach erosion and coastal flooding is possible,” the office posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Lee hit a rare strength that few storms have ever achieved. Only 2% of storms in the Atlantic reach Category 5 strength, according to NOAA’s hurricane database. Including Lee, only 40 Category 5 hurricanes have roamed the Atlantic since 1924. Lee, which was a Category 1 storm Thursday, intensified with exceptional speed in warm ocean waters, more than doubling its wind speeds to 165 mph in just a day. The storm’s winds increased by 85 mph in a 24-hour period, which tied it with Hurricane Matthew for the third-fastest rapid intensification in the Atlantic, according to NOAA research meteorologist John Kaplan. The monstrous hurricane struck Haiti in 2016, killing hundreds in the Caribbean nation while also wreaking havoc on parts of the US Southeast. Category 5 is the highest level on the hurricane wind speed scale and has no maximum point. Hurricanes hit this level when their sustained winds reach 157 mph or higher. A 165-mph storm like Lee is in the same category as Hurricane Allen, the Atlantic’s strongest hurricane on record, which topped out at 190 mph in 1980. Hurricanes need the perfect mixture of warm water, moist air and light upper-level winds to intensify enough to reach Category 5 strength. Lee had all of these, especially warm water amid the warmest summer on record. Sea-surface temperatures across the portion of the Atlantic Ocean that Lee is tracking through are a staggering 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal after rising to “far above record levels” this summer, according to David Zierden, Florida’s state climatologist. Reaching Category 5 strength has become more common over the last decade. Lee is the 8th Category 5 since 2016, meaning 20% of these exceptionally powerful hurricanes on record in NOAA’s hurricane database have come in the last seven years. The Atlantic is not the only ocean to have spawned a monster storm in 2023. All seven ocean basins where tropical cyclones can form have had a storm reach Category 5 strength so far this year, including Hurricane Jova, which reached Category 5 status in the eastern Pacific earlier this week. Computer model trends for Lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north early next week. But exactly when that turn occurs and how far west Lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the US. Several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close Lee will get to the East Coast. An area of high pressure over the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda High, will have a major influence on how quickly Lee turns. The Bermuda High is expected to remain very strong into the weekend, which will keep Lee on its current west-northwestward track and slow it down a bit. As the high pressure weakens next week it will allow Lee to start moving northward. Once that turn to the north occurs, the position of the jet stream – strong upper-level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane’s path – will influence how closely Lee is steered to the US. Scenario: Out to Sea Lee could make a quick turn to the north early next week if high pressure weakens significantly. If the jet stream sets up along the East Coast, it will act as a barrier that prevents Lee from approaching the coast. This scenario would keep Lee farther away from the US coast but could bring the storm closer to Bermuda. Scenario: Close to East Coast Lee could make a slower turn to the north because the high pressure remains robust, and the jet stream sets up farther inland over the Eastern US. This scenario would leave portions of the East Coast, mainly north of the Carolinas, vulnerable to a much closer approach from Lee. All these factors have yet to come into focus, and the hurricane is still at least seven days from being a threat to the East Coast. Any potential US impact will become more clear as the Lee moves west in the coming days.",Weather
"Hurricane Lee’s path is still unclear, but the East Coast could see dangerous rip currents and large waves beginning this weekend"," Hurricane Lee maintained major hurricane status Friday evening as the powerful storm’s indirect – yet dangerous – impacts were expected to reach the waters of the East Coast as early as this weekend. The hurricane, now a Category 3 storm that briefly strengthened to a rare Category 5 in the Atlantic Ocean, is packing destructive maximum sustained winds of 115 mph and is about 440 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands as of 11 p.m. ET Friday. “Some fluctuations in intensity are likely over the next few days, however Lee is expected to remain a powerful major hurricane through early next week,” the National Hurricane Center said. It’s too soon to know whether this system will directly impact the US mainland, but the storm will create dangerous coastal conditions like rip currents and large waves along the East Coast as soon as Sunday regardless of its final track.

Lee adds to a growing trend of intense hurricanes powered by warmer oceans," Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified at a historic pace into a Category 5 storm Thursday night, adding to a spate of extremely intense hurricanes this year and in recent decades which experts say is a symptom of the climate crisis. Lee is now the eighth Category 5 storm in the North Atlantic since 2016, which means 20% of Category 5 hurricanes on record in the basin have occurred in the last seven years, a CNN analysis of NOAA’s hurricane database shows. This year alone, Category 5 storms have already appeared in all seven ocean basins where tropical cyclones form, including Hurricane Jova, which also rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 storm earlier this week. “The increase in Category 4 or 5 storms, especially that we’ve seen over the last couple years due to the increase in rapid intensification, is a telltale sign of climate change, which is exactly what we expect to see in a warmer world,” Kevin Reed, a hurricane expert and professor at Stony Brook University’s school of marine and atmospheric sciences, told CNN. Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Brooklyn-based nonprofit First Street Foundation, agrees. He cautions the NOAA database had not fully counted storms prior to the satellite era, and while advances in technology have made it easier to measure hurricanes, it is still difficult to determine the real trend. Still, he said at the breakneck pace at which the oceans are warming, high intensity tropical cyclones are likely occurring more often. “It is very likely that there are more Category 5 storms now than there were 40 years ago,” Kossin told CNN. The primary way in which storms reach Category 4 or 5 strength is by undergoing a rapid intensification process — when a storm’s winds strengthen rapidly by at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, said Reed. It’s just one of the ways experts say the climate crisis is making hurricanes more dangerous, as warmer waters allow for storms to strengthen quicker and reach higher categories on the hurricane wind speed scale. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The short of it is, as the sea surface temperatures warm, because of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, the likelihood that any event will undergo rapid intensification will increase,” Reed said. Rapid intensification has been happening more and more as storms are approaching landfall, making them harder to prepare for. Hurricane Idalia rapidly intensified by 55 mph in 24 hours before landfall along Florida’s Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane late last month. And in the North Atlantic, where ocean temperatures have been off the charts, storms like Lee have had quite a feast. Lee’s winds increased 85 mph in 24 hours, the third-fastest a storm has rapidly intensified on record in the Atlantic Ocean, according to NOAA research meteorologist John Kaplan. “There is little doubt that the exceptionally warm ocean waters we’re seeing have a human fingerprint on them,” Kossin said. “Add to this the warming effects of the El Niño happening this year and we have a recipe for breaking a lot of temperature records.” Kossin noted this is especially true in the eastern North Pacific, where warming from a growing El Niño is most concentrated. “Jova is sitting in the middle of this, and the warm water certainly fueled the rapid intensification,” he added. One thing is for certain: As the world’s oceans continue to warm, experts say the frequency at which these top-of-scale storms can occur and intensify will only increase.",Weather
Hurricane Lee rapidly strengthens to Category 5 storm as it approaches the Caribbean," Hurricane Lee has strengthened into a major Category 5 storm, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 160 mph as it spins over the Atlantic well east of the Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said in an 11 p.m. ET advisory Thursday. Lee, which was a Category 1 storm earlier Thursday, has been intensifying with exceptional speed in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, doubling its wind speeds in the last 24 hours. The hurricane was located about 700 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, the hurricane center said in the 11 p.m. advisory. The storm will likely reach its peak intensity by this weekend and is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane over the southwestern Atlantic early next week, though it’s too soon to know whether this system will directly impact the US mainland. Dangerous surf and rip currents will spread across the northern Caribbean on Friday and begin affecting the United States on Sunday, the center said. There is increasing confidence that the center of Lee will pass to the north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend and into early next week. Tropical storm conditions, life-threatening surf and rip currents could occur on some of these islands over the weekend. Also Thursday, a tropical depression in the eastern Atlantic strengthened into Tropical Storm Margot, just a few hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands, the center said. Margot currently has winds of 40 mph and steady strengthening is expected – the center is forecasting Margot to become a hurricane over the weekend. The forecast track shows the storm turning to the north over the central Atlantic early next week, but it is not expected to threaten any land areas as of Thursday. Computer model trends for Lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north early next week. But exactly when that turn occurs and how far west Lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the US. Here’s what will steer the storm and two potential scenarios meteorologists are watching for how the US threat could play out. Several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close Lee will get to the East Coast. An area of high pressure over the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda High, will have a major influence in how quickly Lee turns. The Bermuda High is expected to remain very strong into the weekend, which will keep Lee on its current west-northwestward track and slow it down a bit. As the high pressure weakens next week it will allow Lee to start moving northward. Once that turn to the north occurs, the position of the jet stream – strong upper-level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane’s path – will influence how closely Lee is steered to the US.

Hurricane Lee strengthens to Category 4 storm as it approaches the Caribbean," Hurricane Lee has strengthened into a major Category 4 storm with maximum sustained wind speeds of 130 mph, according to the 5 p.m. EDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center. “Additional strengthening is expected tonight. Fluctuations in intensity are expected after that, but Lee is forecast to remain a powerful major hurricane well into next week,” the center said. Lee, which was a Category 1 storm earlier Thursday, has been intensifying with exceptional speed in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, strengthening by 50 mph in the last 12 hours. The hurricane is located about 780 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, the hurricane center said in its 5 p.m. update. The storm will likely reach its peak intensity this weekend and is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane over the southwestern Atlantic early next week, though it’s too soon to know whether this system will directly impact the US mainland. Dangerous surf and rip currents will spread across the northern Caribbean on Friday and begin affecting the United States on Sunday, the center said. There is increasing confidence that the center of Lee will pass to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend and into early next week. There is a potential for tropical storm conditions to occur on some of these islands over the weekend. The swells are expected to reach portions of the Lesser Antilles on Friday, and the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend. Even more rapid intensification is expected because the forecast track takes the hurricane across some of the warmest waters in the Atlantic Ocean and through relatively calm upper-level winds – ripe conditions for a hurricane to grow more fierce. “All the ingredients are in place for the storm to really intensify,” Jason Dunion, director of NOAA’s Hurricane Field Program, told CNN. Lee’s winds are expected to peak at 160 mph, or Category 5-strength, Friday night as it approaches the eastern Caribbean and is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane over the southwestern Atlantic early next week. Also Thursday, a tropical depression in the eastern Atlantic strengthened into Tropical Storm Margot, just a few hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands, the center said. Margot currently has winds of 40 mph and steady strengthening is expected – the center is forecasting Margot to become a hurricane over the weekend. The forecast track shows the storm turning to the north over the central Atlantic early next week, but it is not expected to threaten any land areas as of Thursday. The waters in the Atlantic are not quite as warm as the steamy conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, which gave rise to Hurricane Idalia last week. However, sea-surface temperatures across the portion of the Atlantic Ocean that Lee is set to track through are still a staggering 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal after rising to “far above record levels” this summer, according to David Zierden, Florida’s state climatologist. “To get to Category 4 or 5 intensity the environment has to be nearly perfect, which it looks like is the forecast for Lee,” Zierden told CNN. Lee’s maximum forecast intensity of 150 mph is equivalent to the strongest storm in the Atlantic basin this season – Hurricane Franklin – and stronger than any storm so far in the eastern Pacific. If Lee tops 150 mph, it will be the most powerful hurricane to roam either basin this year. That forecast is also just 7 mph shy of Category 5. “This storm definitely has the potential to be a Category 5,” Dunion said, adding that nothing in Lee’s forecast path is expected to hinder the storm’s development leading up to the weekend. The last Category 5 hurricane to roam the Atlantic basin was 2022’s Hurricane Ian. Before that, 2019’s Dorian and Lorenzo were the most recent hurricanes to achieve the feat. Only 39 Category 5 hurricanes have occurred since 1924, according to data from NOAA. Any shifts along Lee’s track as it nears the Leeward Islands would increase the threat of more direct impacts like heavy rainfall and strong winds. Anyone in the eastern Caribbean – including the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola – as well as the Bahamas will need to keep a close eye on the forecast headed into the weekend. Lee is ramping up in intensity as the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season approaches. Sunday, September 10, is the climatological peak of Atlantic hurricane season, when the basin is at its busiest on average.

Tropical Storm Lee is expected to rapidly intensify into an ‘extremely dangerous’ hurricane in the Atlantic by this weekend," Tropical Storm Lee is expected to rapidly intensify into an “extremely dangerous” hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean by this weekend, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday morning, as the season approaches its typical early September peak. Lee could become a hurricane Wednesday then a major Category 3 storm or stronger by late this week, with the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean expected to feel its impacts over the weekend, forecasters said. “Lee is not far from hurricane strength, and it likely will achieve that status later today,” the National Hurricane Center noted in its 5 a.m. update. “While it is too soon to determine the location and magnitude of these possible impacts, interests in this area should monitor the progress of Lee and further updates to the forecast.” The tropical storm is packing maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and is about 1,300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, according to the hurricane center. The islands include the Virgin Islands, Saint Martin, and Antigua and Barbuda. Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the Lesser Antilles on Friday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Lee’s winds could reach 150 mph on Sunday evening, according to the hurricane center. Any shifts along its track as it nears the islands could bring more of an impact there and beyond. Anyone in the eastern Caribbean – including the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola – as well as the Bahamas will need to keep a close eye on the forecast. It’s too soon to know whether this system will directly impact the US mainland, but even if the hurricane stays out at sea, dangerous surf and rip currents could once again threaten the East Coast. One person was killed in a rip current in New Jersey over the Labor Day weekend. Lee became a tropical storm Tuesday after forming earlier in the morning in the central tropical Atlantic and moving through extremely warm waters, according to the National Hurricane Center, which predicts the storm will strengthen rapidly. Rapid intensification is when a storm’s winds strengthen quickly over a short amount of time. Scientists have defined it as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less – a phenomenon aided by warm ocean waters. As Lee moves steadily west-northwest this week, it will enter conditions increasingly favorable for strengthening: Plenty of moisture, low wind shear and abnormally warm water stretch nearly the entire length of the potential cyclone’s projected path. “The NHC intensity forecast is extremely bullish for a first forecast, but remarkably lies below the intensity consensus,” the hurricane center’s storm discussion said. “All indications are that the depression will become a strong hurricane by the end of the forecast period.” Lee would be the fourth to reach that status this season, following Don, Franklin and Idalia. The hurricane is expected to grow significantly stronger by the weekend and is forecast to become the season’s third Category 3 or stronger hurricane as the weekend begins. Sunday, September 10, is the climatological peak of Atlantic hurricane season, when the basin is at its busiest on average. A flurry of tropical activity surrounding this date is not out of the ordinary, but it can turn hazardous fast. The 2023 Atlantic season has already been busy: It is tracking above average for a number of different metrics including number of named storms, number of hurricanes and number of major hurricanes, according to Philip Klotzbach a research scientist at Colorado State University.",Weather
Labor Day sizzle: Extreme heat spreads across two-thirds of US this weekend," Labor Day weekend may mark the unofficial end to summer for many, but Mother Nature didn’t get the memo this year. Nearly 100 temperature records may fall this holiday weekend as parts of the central and eastern United States sizzle under heat that feels more like July than early September. As temperatures soar on land, rough surf and an elevated rip current risk may make beach plans dangerous for a large swath of the Atlantic coast, while a surge of moisture could spark stormy weather for portions of the West and raise the risk of flash flooding. Temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above normal levels for September could break or tie close dozens of records as heat builds over Labor Day weekend and into Tuesday. High temperatures on Saturday will climb into the 90s to low 100s across most of the Plains and Upper Midwest. This will include cities like Omaha, Nebraska, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. By Sunday, sweltering heat will expand across much of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and even portions of the mid-Atlantic. Minneapolis is forecast to reach a scorching 100 degrees on Sunday, which would break a high temperature record for that date that has stood for nearly 100 years. On Labor Day Monday, conditions will feel more like July across nearly two-thirds of the US. Philadelphia is forecast to be hotter than both Miami and Orlando on Monday as temperatures there soar more than 10 degrees above normal. In the heat of the afternoon, temperatures in the 90s and low 100s will stretch from the Plains to the East Coast and challenge records in major metros like Chicago, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. The high temperature in New York City could surpass the 90-degree mark on Monday, something the city fell short of during August and has only reached eight times this summer. That count could increase on both Monday and Tuesday. Temperatures in most of the Southeast will hover around normal, bringing some relief for a region that baked in record heat in August. Many cities along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, including Houston, New Orleans and Tampa, recorded their hottest August of all-time, according to data from the National Weather Service. A handful of tropical systems hundreds of miles away are churning up the Atlantic Ocean and may lead to danger for people headed to the beach. Rip currents can be fatal to even the strongest swimmers. In June, rip currents claimed 11 lives in under two weeks in Florida and Alabama. Powerful Hurricane Franklin and Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia – the latter of which is packing strong winds despite losing its tropical status – are creating rough seas that spread out hundreds of miles from the center of each storm. These rough seas can prove dangerous for any boaters along the Atlantic coast and will keep the risk of hazardous rip currents elevated. Rip current alerts are in effect through Saturday night from South Carolina to southern Florida. The risk of rip currents is also expected to remain elevated through the holiday weekend farther north into portions of New Jersey and New York. A surge of monsoonal moisture will produce stormy conditions from the Southwest to the Rockies this weekend and elevate the risk of flash flooding. A Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in effect for portions of the interior West on Saturday and Sunday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Enough rain to trigger flash flooding can occur in parts of Arizona, Nevada and Utah on Saturday. The threat will shift northward on Sunday to include portions of Idaho and Wyoming in addition to Utah. Wet weather will keep parts of the Northwest and California damp and cooler than average through the weekend, but the flooding risk will be relatively low. Showers may begin as early as Saturday in Seattle and Portland and continue through Monday. Temperatures in these cities will struggle to climb on Sunday and Monday and only reach the upper 60s in Seattle and low 70s in Portland – nearly 10 degrees below normal for early September. Places like Los Angeles and San Francisco may have the best weather in the country for Labor Day weekend. Both cities will start the holiday weekend with a few showers but will end up dry, sunny and seasonable on Monday.",Weather
Recovery efforts are focused on power restoration in Florida communities as sweltering heat moves in after Hurricane Idalia," As many communities along Florida’s west coast face oppressive heat Friday without air conditioning or electricity, crews are racing to restore power to tens of thousands in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia. Idalia inflicted record storm surge and knocked out power for hundreds of thousands after making landfall Wednesday morning as a powerful Category 3 storm, the strongest to touch down in Florida’s coastal Big Bend region in more than a century. As of 10 a.m. Friday, more than 90,000 homes and businesses across several counties reported power outages, according to PowerOutages.us. But officials say turning the lights back on is the top priority after the hurricane damaged thousands of homes, and made many roads impassable due to severe flooding and debris as well as downed trees and power lines. “The bulk of the outages at this point are in that Big Bend region – a lot of the rural counties that bore the brunt of the storm,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday during a news conference. “And so that is priority number one to start getting those reconnected.” The pressing need for power restoration comes as temperatures across the Big Bend region – the area between the panhandle and peninsula – are expected to continue seeing heat that can feel as high as 95 degrees Friday. Some areas also don’t have clean running water. Additionally, parts of the Big Bend region could see up to 3 inches of rain Friday into Saturday, which could impede recovery efforts as those areas are already waterlogged from Idalia. Shonteria Hills found herself with few options when she tried to cool off at her local library in Monticello  –  a small city roughly 30 miles east of Tallahassee – but couldn’t because it was also in the dark. “That’s going to be very tough. That’s going to be very tough living in an area where it is extremely hot as it is,” Hills told CNN affiliate WCTV. “We’re already in the heat. No air. No food. We really don’t know how to survive this. We really need answers about when the power is going to be back on.” Deanne Criswell, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday the biggest concern currently is power restoration, noting that mutual aid resources have been deployed and the US Army Corps of Engineers is on standby to assist. Making matters even more challenging is that the rain and humidity that arrived after Idalia barreled through caused temperatures to feel like they were well above 100 degrees Thursday. The destruction Idalia left behind in Florida was not as severe as it could have been. Still, the ferocious storm flooded thousands of homes while ripping off roofs and dumping waist-deep water amounts onto many roads. As it weakened to a tropical storm, it also lashed the Carolinas with intense flooding and whipped up fierce winds in southern Georgia. As of late Thursday, the exact death toll from Idalia and the full extent of damage in Florida were unclear. After DeSantis and Criswell toured the hard-hit communities of Cedar Key, Horseshoe Beach and Steinhatchee along the west coast in the Big Bend region on Thursday, they said they’d witnessed significant flood damage. Some residents told CNN they were relieved Idalia’s aftermath wasn’t as bad as they anticipated. Anthony Altman, the businesses owner of EXPLORIDA, an ecotourism company that offers manatee and scalloping tours, said the impact to his property could have been worse had he not prepared to evacuate ahead of the storm. Altman said he rented a truck and moved his merchandise out of his business in Crystal River before Idalia made landfall, which he said helped minimize damage. Altman and his employees have begun the cleanup, and they’re hoping to reopen soon. “We got about 22 employees that are with us and that’s 22 families and all local, so we want to get open for them,” Altman said. Meanwhile in Cedar Key – which is about 55 miles north of Crystal River – several houses along the water were destroyed while homes that are located more inland appeared untouched. Heather Greenwood, who manages Cedar Key Bed & Breakfast on the island, told CNN she was relieved that her property suffered minimal damage. “Look at what is positive about it all. I mean, our house is still standing. Some are not,” Greenwood said, noting there was no loss of life in her community. But deaths have been reported elsewhere. Two men were killed in separate, weather-related crashes Wednesday morning as Idalia barreled across Florida, Sgt. Steve Gaskins of the state’s highway patrol said. On Thursday, DeSantis said, “So far, there’s been one confirmed fatality and that was a traffic fatality in Alachua County.” It’s not clear why the governor and the highway patrol have different numbers for weather-related deaths. CNN has sought clarification. Another death was reported in southern Georgia’s Lowndes County, where a man trying to cut a tree on a highway died after a tree fell on him, Sheriff Ashley Paulk told CNN. The human impact could have been much worse, according to some experts who credited both the accurate forecast and people’s decisions to follow evacuation warnings. “It seems that people have heeded that call, and we’re grateful for that,” said Kevin Guthrie, who heads the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The governor echoed Guthrie’s stance: “I think those officials in those really hard-hit counties … did a good job. I think citizens responded very appropriately,” DeSantis said Thursday. DeSantis also credited the accuracy of Idalia’s forecast. The National Hurricane Center issued its first Idalia forecast last Saturday – back when the storm was near Cozumel, Mexico – and projected a US landfall within 10 miles of where it actually struck five days later, near Keaton Beach, Florida. And by then, at least 28 Florida counties had issued evacuation orders. “These forecasts were pretty doggone accurate, particularly compared to what happened with Hurricane Ian – where we went in a matter of 48 hours to potentially having a Big Bend impact, then all of a sudden migrating all the way down to southwest Florida,” DeSantis said Thursday. The low death toll was “probably something that most people would not have bet on, four or five days ago, knowing how strong the storm was going to get,” DeSantis said. “So, my hat’s off to the people on the ground there who did a good job.”",Weather
"Severe thunderstorms in Arizona knock out power to tens of thousands with high winds, heavy rains and dust storm warnings"," Severe thunderstorms bombarded the Phoenix area Thursday night, knocking out power for more than 30,000 homes and businesses in Arizona while threatening flash flooding and dust storm conditions. The northwestern portion of Maricopa County – home to the state’s most populous city of Phoenix  – was under a dust storm warning late Thursday. The Phoenix area is also under severe thunderstorm warnings. “Thunderstorm activity has dispersed over much of Maricopa County. Additional development remains possible at this time,” the National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a social media post late Thursday. The storms led to the delay of the second half of the Sun Devil Football game at Mountain America Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, the team said on social media. “Lightning strikes continue within 8 miles. Currently at least 45 minutes before we can get players on the field or allow fans back in the stands,” the team posted on social media Thursday evening. But it wasn’t until about two hours later when the team said players were warming up and would resume the game shortly. Videos on social media show dust spinning in the sky and causing an orange-tinted haze in the air. Earlier, forecasters warned that strong thunderstorms would bring gusty winds, blowing dust, heavy rainfall and frequent lightning. In addition to the dust storm conditions, a flash flood warning has also been issued for Maricopa County, where dangerous flooding is possible in cities, highways and streets. Maricopa County accounted for more than 27,000 power outages, PowerOutage.us data showed early Friday morning. Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix reported winds of 47 mph, with gusts up to 71 mph. Winds of this level can produce dense, blowing dust, which can plummet visibility down to as low as a quarter of a mile and create life-threatening travel conditions.",Weather
‘This is a life-changing event’: Floridians start an arduous recovery after disastrous Idalia," Idalia, now a post-tropical cyclone, is moving farther away from North Carolina’s coast after unleashing heavy rains and powerful winds across the Southeast this week and leaving parts of Florida’s west coast with “significant damage.” It was the most powerful hurricane to slam its Big Bend region in more than a century. Next, Idalia will impact Bermuda this weekend, prompting a Tropical Storm Watch to be issued there, according to the National Hurricane Center. In its wake, the storm left thousands of homes damaged in Florida – some with shredded walls and roofs, others with murky, waist-high floodwater that officials warn could be dangerous for days to come. Several deaths have been reported, but the devastation was not as immense as it could have been after the Category 3 hurricane pummeled Florida before tearing through southern Georgia and South Carolina. Some have credited improved forecasting for spurring residents to evacuate the right places well ahead of time. The National Hurricane Center issued its first Idalia forecast Saturday – back when the storm was near Cozumel, Mexico – and projected a US landfall within 10 miles of where it actually struck five days later, near Keaton Beach, Florida. By then, at least 28 Florida counties had issued evacuation orders. “These forecasts were pretty doggone accurate, particularly compared to what happened with Hurricane Ian – where we went in a matter of 48 hours to potentially having a Big Bend impact, then all of a sudden migrating all the way down to southwest Florida,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday. A low death toll was “probably something that most people would not have bet on four or five days ago, knowing how strong the storm was going to get,” DeSantis said. “So my hat’s off to the people on the ground there who did a good job.” Still, dozens of people had to be rescued from perilous floodwaters brought on by the double whammy of torrential rain and walls of seawater crashing onto land. At least 40 people were rescued overnight, the governor said Thursday, with more rescues expected. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES Here’s the latest on Idalia’s wrath and aftermath: • Parts of the Southeast are still in danger: “Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S. coast during the next few days and will reach Bermuda on Friday,” the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. “These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.” • Thousands of homes damaged: Between 4,000 and 6,000 homes have been inundated in Florida’s Pasco County alone, county administrator Mike Carballa said. • Federal disaster declaration: President Joe Biden has formally declared a major disaster in Florida. “The President’s action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Citrus, Dixie, Hamilton, Lafayette, Levy, Suwannee, and Taylor,” the White House said in a statement Thursday. Biden said he will visit Florida on Saturday. • Flood rescues: Emergency crews saved about 150 residents from flooded neighborhoods in Pasco County, the fire-rescue chief said. Some parts of the county – just north of Tampa – saw water surges between 3 and 5 feet. • Historic water levels: In South Carolina, Charleston Harbor’s water level spiked more than 9 feet, the National Weather Service said. In Florida, Cedar Key, East Bay Tampa, Clearwater Beach and St. Petersburg endured record storm surges. • Thousands in the dark: About 91,000 Florida power customers still had no electricity Thursday night, according to poweroutage.us. But service has been restored to hundreds of thousands of others who lost power during the storm, the governor said. • Boil water advisory: Some areas in DeSoto, Dixie, Leon, Levy, Marion and Taylor counties in Florida are under boil water notices issued by the state’s health department. • Some school districts to reopen: At least 30 of 52 school districts that closed ahead of the storm have reopened Thursday, DeSantis said. Eight are scheduled to reopen Friday. It’s still not clear how much destruction Idalia inflicted as it hurled 125-mph winds and record-breaking storm surge on Florida’s Big Bend area – the nook between the panhandle and peninsula. “What I saw from the land is a significant amount of flooding damage,” Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a Thursday news briefing after touring the storm damage. Criswell and DeSantis toured several parts of the impacted areas, including the island city of Cedar Key and Steinhatchee, by ground. “We were just in Horseshoe Beach, you have an old First Baptist Church there. It had four and a half feet of water, so the place is basically ruined,” the governor said. “You have people losing homes, losing businesses, really, really a lot of work that needs to be done.” Many places that bore the brunt of Idalia’s wrath “don’t necessarily have the resources” to handle such a powerful hurricane, said US Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who used to lead the state’s Division of Emergency Management. “There are some communities that may never look the same and others that will get rebuilt that will look slightly different,” he said. “This is a life-changing event for some of these counties.” Michael Bobbitt, a Cedar Key resident who rode out the storm to help his neighbors, said the scene was “almost apocalyptic.” “When the wind was kicking in the middle of the night, and when the water was coming toward us from all three sides, it looked like a leviathan trying to reach out of the water to devour us whole. It was biblical stuff,” Bobbitt said Wednesday night. Some traditional Florida villas “were just picked up and carried into the Gulf, so that was heartbreaking to see,” Bobbitt said. “My neighbor’s house across from me was submerged to the roof line, but we had no injuries,” he said. “We’re here. We’ll rebuild. We’ll do what Cedar Key does. All in all, I feel incredibly blessed.” He credited the federal, state and local government with a “remarkable response” to the disaster. “We’ve got what we need. The resources are in place, and we’re already about the business of rebuilding this island,” Bobbitt said. Two men were killed in separate, weather-related crashes Wednesday morning as Idalia barreled across Florida, Sgt. Steve Gaskins of Florida Highway Patrol said. But on Thursday, DeSantis said “so far, there’s been one confirmed fatality and that was a traffic fatality in Alachua County.” It’s not clear why the governor and the highway patrol have different numbers for weather-related deaths. CNN has sought clarification. And in Georgia, a man trying to cut a tree on a highway in Lowndes County died after a tree fell on him, Sheriff Ashley Paulk told CNN. But despite the devastation, many Floridians were grateful Idalia’s impact wasn’t more catastrophic. “We got buzz-sawed along the side,” Pasco County Administrator Mike Carballa said. “Quite honestly, while the effects could have been worse, we definitely took it on the chin.”",Weather
How Idalia’s final moments dramatically altered its impact on Florida and prevented a worse disaster," Hurricane Idalia caused “significant damage” after it ripped into Florida’s Big Bend with 125 mph winds and record-setting storm surge. But the storm’s evolution before landfall, and lucky timing with the tides, likely prevented an even worse disaster. Forecasts from the National Hurricane Center called for Idalia to rapidly intensify and strengthen all the way up to landfall. And for 24 hours, that proved to be true. The hurricane’s winds increased by 55 mph, pushing Idalia into a 130-mph, Category 4 – a rate of intensification so exceptional it ranks in the top 0.4% of Atlantic storms since 1982, according to NOAA research meteorologist John Kaplan. But then something changed. On Wednesday morning, with the storm just 20 miles and 45 minutes from landfall, the hurricane center announced Idalia’s winds dropped 5 mph because it was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. An eyewall replacement cycle is akin to a snake shedding its skin. Strong hurricanes can shed a smaller eyewall – the ring of most intense winds that surrounds the hurricane’s calm eye – in favor of a larger one. During this process, the storm’s winds can weaken, but when it’s complete, the storm will be larger and can then start to intensify even further. Idalia’s landfall kept this process from completing, preventing the hurricane from being even larger and more intense than forecast at landfall. “If it would have been six or 12 hours more over water, I think a totally different hurricane would have made landfall,” Jamie Rhome, Deputy Director of the National Hurricane Center told CNN. Even Idalia’s incomplete eyewall cycle could have had a “massive” effect on what people experienced, Rhome said. The hurricane’s structure was changing, which affected where the strongest winds were set up and who got the worst surge as a result. A small, condensed eye could produce higher surge, but over a more confined area, Rhome said. In those kinds of storms, “the swath of surge is so tiny you could literally walk across it,” said Rhome. Hurricane Charley was one such example: it made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane but only produced 6 to 7 feet of surge over a small area. But in the case of Idalia, the wind field was expanding during the eyewall replacement cycle, which means it could have broadened the scope of the surge at the expense of its peak intensity. “It would dramatically change where surge happens,” Rhome said. “I can’t put into words just how sensitive surge is to the wind. Not just the wind speed, but also the wind direction, too. These structural changes can also change the angle of the wind, which can have dramatic impacts on the surge or the timing of the wind (and the surge) relative to the tide.” The tides were another key factor in the severity of the surge, especially in Cedar Key, Florida. “The other thing that happened with Cedar Key is the (storm’s) timing changed,” Rhome said. “It, luckily, luckily came in at low tide, which probably whacked, you know, four feet off of (the surge), just with that.” Rhome said post-storm analysis will be done to better understand exactly what effect the eyewall replacement cycle and other factors had on Idalia. Surveys will also be done to determine just how bad the storm surge was, which is complicated by the fact that there are very few tidal gauges in this area to actually measure the storm surge. A CNN analysis of the National Hurricane Center’s forecast showed it was nearly spot-on. Five days before landfall, the forecast was within 10 miles of where Idalia’s center would eventually come ashore. And by early Monday, the forecast was already calling for a Category 3 at landfall. Rhome also said he believes the surveys will show there was widespread 10 feet of storm surge, which was also in the forecast. But not everything can be so accurately predicted, and Idalia showed the minutiae of something as complicated as a hurricane can make a big difference on what people actually experience. Rapid intensification and eyewall replacement cycles – specifically, the timing of them – are some of the most difficult things to forecast in the field of meteorology. Forecasters know when they are likely, Rhome said, but it’s “next to impossible” to know when they will complete. “There’s a societal expectation of perfection in these forecasts that exceeds the limits of predictability – society’s desire to know precisely what’s going to happen at their doorstep five days prior,” Rhome said. “While I understand that need, there’s just no science right now that would allow us to provide that.”",Weather
"Deadly Tropical Storm Idalia floods parts of South Carolina, including Charleston, after pummeling Florida"," Idalia weakened to a tropical storm Wednesday evening as it dumped heavy rain, unleashed strong winds and knocked out power in parts of southern Georgia and the Carolinas, just hours after pummeling Florida’s west coast and inundating communities there with floodwater. As the storm moved through South Carolina Wednesday night, the water level at the Charleston Harbor was higher than 9 feet, the National Weather Service said – making it the fifth highest water level ever recorded and only slightly lower than levels reached during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. “Major coastal inundation being reported at Edisto Beach and Downtown Charleston,” the weather service said. “Water has breached the Charleston Battery. Dunes are breached at Edisto with water flowing under homes and onto roadways.” Some roads were closed due to flooding, Charleston police said, and access to some areas was limited. “Trees are down. Roads are flooded,” the Charleston County Sheriff’s Office said. “If you encounter street flooding, turn around.” In Florida’s Crystal River, the waters that began receding after the storm passed revealed a “catastrophic event,” city council member Ken Frink told CNN Wednesday afternoon. “All the homes around us,” Frink said, were “all underwater.” In nearby coastal Pasco County, just north of Tampa, roughly 6,000 homes were “inundated with water,” according to one official. “Many of them that we’re seeing have major damage,” Laura Wilcoxen, the Pasco County Emergency Management assistant director, told CNN. “We have water at least 18 inches or higher that have gone into these homes.” President Joe Biden said Wednesday he has offered governors across the Southeast “anything their states need” to respond to the storm, and, speaking more widely on the country’s recent natural disasters, said: “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore.” As of 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, the storm’s center was roughly 15 miles north-northwest of Charleston, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Coastal and river flooding threats remained for parts of Georgia and the Carolinas into early Thursday, the National Weather Service warned. Idalia’s center will move near or along South Carolina’s coast through Wednesday night before moving offshore near North Carolina’s coast Thursday, the center said. Up to 10 inches of rain could drop over parts of east-central Georgia to central and eastern South Carolina and through eastern North Carolina into Thursday, the hurricane center said. “These rainfall amounts will lead to areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with considerable impacts,” the center added. Late Wednesday afternoon, Idalia’s rain stretched 600 miles, spanning central Florida to central North Carolina, while the storm’s strong winds affected more than 300 miles of that area. Tornadoes are also possible through daybreak Thursday across coastal North Carolina, the hurricane center said. Video footage captured a car being lifted up and flipped over during a tornado in the South Carolina city of Goose Creek Wednesday afternoon, police told CNN. The car struck another vehicle traveling on the same road and two people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, police said. A tornado watch remains in effect for Goose Creek and other parts of the state through Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday there was “one unconfirmed fatality” in the storm’s aftermath. Earlier, Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Steve Gaskins said two men were killed in two separate accidents Wednesday morning during severe storm conditions from Idalia. Gaskins said both deaths were weather-related. It’s unclear if DeSantis is talking about one of these crashes. CNN has reached out to the agencies for clarification. In Georgia, Lowndes County Sheriff Ashley Paulk told CNN a storm-related death occurred in the county Wednesday afternoon. A tree fell on a man who had been cutting another tree that was on a highway, killing him, Paulk said. Earlier Wednesday, local officials had warned “it is very dangerous out,” urging residents to stay inside. “We cannot stress this enough, trees and power lines are down all across Lowndes County, please stay off of the streets unless it’s an emergency,” county leaders wrote on Facebook. In Florida, urban search and rescue personnel have sifted through roughly 75% of the areas hit by the storm, Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie said in a Wednesday evening news conference. Secondary searches will begin for heavily impacted areas to “ensure that those have been cleared and there’s nobody there,” Guthrie said. “We are not finding anybody at home,” he added. “Many, many people heeded the warnings to evacuate and we, so far, have not had any reports of … fatalities related to any drowning or any flooding.” Evacuation orders, some mandatory, were issued in at least 28 Florida counties. In storm-ravaged Florida Wednesday evening, authorities were working to restore roads, deploying crews across hard-hit neighborhoods and warning residents to stay vigilant. Taylor County Sheriff Wayne Padgett urged residents Wednesday to stay inside, noting downed trees and power lines can be dangerous, and said people walking around can interfere with rescue and clean-up efforts. In Pasco County, authorities conducted more than 80 rescue missions, saving at least 150 people – ranging from just days old to 90 – from floodwaters, local leaders said in a Facebook post. Pasco County Fire Chief Tony Perez told CNN’s Erica Hill those rescue missions began at roughly 3:30 a.m. Wednesday and call numbers intensified around 6 a.m. He said people chose to stay put for a variety of reasons, including one woman who told officials she didn’t have money or a place to go, while another family wanted to protect their belongings and memories. In Citrus County, which includes Crystal River, Sheriff Mike Prendergast told CNN the hurricane’s effects will continue “to play out for a long time” and urged people not to venture into the water that still filled the streets. “Don’t get out onto that water, because it is salt water mixed in with a lot of other things,” the sheriff said. “It’s going to destroy your vehicles, and then it’s going to give you a costly repair bill whenever you get past the storm.” FOLLOW HURRICANE IDALIA LIVE UPDATES Late Wednesday, more than 150,000 customers remained without power in Florida, and another 145,000 in Georgia, and 36,000 in South Carolina, according to PowerOutage.us. On Wednesday evening, boil water notices were issued for areas across DeSoto, Dixie, Leon, Levy, Marion and Taylor counties, according to Florida’s health department. Ten Florida hospitals that were evacuated ahead of the storm reported minimal damage and nine of those expect to be “at full operational status within the next 24 hours,” DeSantis said at Wednesday evening’s news conference. And at least 30 of 52 school districts that closed because of the storm will be open again Thursday, the governor said, and an additional eight will reopen Friday. Authorities will soon begin conducting initial assessments to try and determine the costs of the storm’s damage, Guthrie said. Idalia slammed Florida’s Big Bend area – the nook between the panhandle and peninsula – near Keaton Beach Wednesday morning at a dangerous Category 3 strength. That part of the Gulf Coast hasn’t seen such deadly storm surge and wind gust for at least 125 years. In the vulnerable island city of Cedar Key, a water level record was shattered amid 8 to 9 feet of storm surge. Cedar Key looked “almost apocalyptic” even before landfall, resident Michael Bobbitt said Wednesday morning. Hours later, the disastrous storm surge had overwhelmed it. Lifelong Floridian Bobby Witt, who decided to ride out the storm on a boat in Cedar Key, said the storm surge was higher than he expected, and the storm was the worst he’s experienced. “There’s a lot of damage here on the island,” he told CNN’s Hill. “It was quite a night, rougher than rough.” Storm surge accounts for about half of all hurricane-related deaths, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. In Crystal River, authorities spent much of Wednesday conducting rescues and pulling people out of their homes, City Manager Doug Baber told Hill Wednesday night. “Now we’re moving on to the next step, which is how we’re going to rebuild. Crystal River was decimated,” Baber said. “We had 8 feet of storm surge come inside City Hall. It’s gone.” Swaths of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Fort Myers Beach were also engulfed by wind-whipped seawater and torrential rain.",Weather
The ways Hurricane Idalia made history," Hurricane Idalia has left its mark on history, proving to be a once-in-a-lifetime storm for parts of Florida. Idalia made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained wind speeds of 125 mph Wednesday morning in Florida’s Big Bend region – where the panhandle meets the peninsula – near Keaton Beach. Follow live updates: Idalia spreading damage across the Southeast Idalia’s journey since it first formed in the Caribbean Sea over the weekend has been anything but ordinary. Here are some of its most notable superlatives: With maximum winds of 125 mph, Idalia was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region in more than 125 years. The last storm of Idalia’s strength to slam the region was an unnamed Category 3 hurricane in 1896. The unnamed hurricane also had sustained winds of 125 mph at landfall. Idalia was the first major hurricane – Category 3 or stronger – on record to track through Florida’s Apalachee Bay, a northern inlet in the Big Bend. Idalia’s storm surge was record-breaking from Tampa to the Big Bend. More than 8 feet of storm surge sent water levels in Cedar Key, Florida, to 6.8 feet above their highest normal tides on Wednesday morning. This shattered the previous high water level of 5.99 feet from Hurricane Hermine in 2016. In Tampa Bay, water levels surpassed 4.5 feet on Wednesday morning, exceeding the previous high water mark of 3.79 feet from Tropical Storm Eta in 2020. Clearwater Beach also set a new record-high water level at 4.05 feet, surpassing the previous record of 4.02 feet from the 1993 Storm of the Century. Storm surge rushing through the Steinhatchee River in Steinhatchee, Florida, also caused water levels there to rise 9 feet in two hours and hit record levels there. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee issued two extreme wind warnings on Wednesday morning as the strongest winds from Idalia came ashore. These types of warnings are only issued when sustained winds of 115 mph or greater are expected in an area. Until Wednesday, only 27 extreme wind warnings had ever been issued in the continental US. The majority of these warnings have been issued in Florida. Hurricane Idalia went through a period of rapid intensification Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning as it tracked over the exceptionally warm water of the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists have been alarmed at how warm ocean temperatures have been this year, including in the Gulf if Mexico and around southern Florida, where sea surface temperature climbed to around 100 degrees Fahrenheit earlier this summer. Average sea surface temperature in Idalia’s path was recently measured at nearly 88 degrees Fahrenheit — a record there since data began in the early 1980s. With an enormous pool of warm-water energy to draw from, the hurricane’s sustained winds increased a staggering 55 mph over the course of 24 hours. Rapid intensification is defined as an increase of at least 35 mph within a 24 hour period. Idalia was a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph sustained winds early Tuesday morning. By early Wednesday, it was a monstrous Category 4 with sustained winds of 130 mph.",Weather
Hurricane Idalia is expected to hit Florida as a Category 4 storm as officials warn of ‘potential for death and catastrophic devastation’," Hurricane Idalia could hit Florida’s west coast as an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 storm Wednesday morning, the National Hurricane Center warned as Idalia continued to intensify and churn toward the state late Tuesday. Officials across coastal communities repeatedly pleaded with residents Tuesday to immediately evacuate, stressing that high waters from the storm could prove deadly and first responders will not be able to help until the storm passes. But, desperate to save their homes and businesses and not leave others behind, some Floridians are staying put. “If you haven’t evacuated, you’re north of Fort Myers, you’re up into the central Gulf Coast, northern Big Bend area, if you have not evacuated, you need to do that right now. You need to drop what you’re doing, you need to go to your room, pack up, pack your things, and get to safety,” Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie warned Tuesday evening. “We’re going to experience historical flood surge.” The storm was at Category 2 with sustained winds of up to 110 mph late Tuesday shortly before midnight, centered roughly 120 miles southwest of Florida’s Cedar Key, the hurricane center said. Its outer bands have been lashing Florida for hours, already causing flooding in some coastal areas. It’s expected to continue strengthening into a Category 4 hurricane – meaning sustained winds of at least 130 mph – before it reaches Florida’s Big Bend coast Wednesday morning. “Destructive life-threatening” winds will hit the area where Idalia’s core moves onshore, the hurricane center warned. Storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet above ground level – high enough to stack a wall of seawater halfway up the second floor of an average building – and destructive waves could be “catastrophic” between the Wakulla-Jefferson County line and Yankeetown, Florida, the center said. Strong wind will spread inland across northern Florida and southern Georgia near Idalia’s track, likely knocking out power along the way, the hurricane center said. “There is great potential for death and catastrophic devastation,” the Taylor County Sheriff’s Office warned on Tuesday, saying coastal residents were ordered to evacuate. “Storm surge on the coastal regions are projected as non-survivable.” The county, just southeast of the state capital, Tallahassee, is part of the Big Bend region. “That is storm surge that, if you’re there while that hits, it’s going to be very difficult to survive,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a Tuesday evening news conference. A tornado watch is also in effect for more than 7 million people across central and western Florida, including Tampa, until 6 a.m. Wednesday. Short-lived and usually weak tornadoes are often associated with the outer bands of tropical systems that make landfall. On the island city of Cedar Key, on the southern side of the Big Bend, Mayor Heath Davis urged residents under a mandatory evacuation order to leave immediately. “This storm is worse than we’ve ever seen. My family has been here for many generations, we haven’t seen a storm this bad, ever,” he said Tuesday. All emergency services will stop Tuesday evening as winds pick up, the mayor said, adding he does not want to put employees’ lives in danger. Cedar Key could be cut off by the high storm surge, National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said. FOLLOW HURRICANE IDALIA LIVE UPDATES Parts of Levy County, where Cedar Key is, could see “powerful battering waves” and life-threatening flooding, and many buildings could be damaged or washed away, the National Weather Service said. DeSantis stressed Tuesday that residents under evacuation orders should leave now, as weather conditions will only deteriorate. “If you do choose to stay in one of the evacuation zones, first responders will not be able to get you until after the storm has passed,” he added. Nearly 600 urban search and rescue personnel were prepared to be deployed to help in those efforts, the governor said. Storm surge was captured on video Tuesday by several residents across southwest Florida, including Fort Myers Beach, a community still reeling from the devastation it suffered last fall from Hurricane Ian – which leveled coastal Florida and left more than 100 dead. Florida resident Scott Martin shared a video on Facebook showing roads in Fort Myers Beach already flooded and the “storm hasn’t even hit,” he wrote. Track Idalia here >> Chase Norwood, whose family owns the Sea Hag Marina in Steinhatchee, has stayed behind despite warnings to leave, telling CNN’s John Berman the marina is “pretty much our livelihood.” The marina prides itself on being “one of the largest and most well-equipped marinas on Florida’s Big Bend,” according to its website. “We got to see the destruction Hurricane Ian did down in Fort Myers … We’ve seen stuff I didn’t know a storm could do, and so it was a real big eye-opener to my whole family,” Norwood said. “With the insurance and stuff, we’re all worried and that’s why we’re kind of staying here to see if there’s anything that we can do to protect what we have.” Lori Leigh Batts-Bennett already evacuated her condo in Steinhatchee, but told CNN Tuesday night many people chose to stay behind, hoping to protect their home and belongings. She says she’s worried about what the storm’s damage will mean for that community. “Steinhatchee does not have the infrastructure to handle these storms,” Batts-Bennett said. “I fear that if this is catastrophic, the people that make Steinhatchee will not be able to be in Steinhatchee because they wont be able to rebuild.” “The landscape of Steinhatchee will be changed forever,” she added. Residents should beware of flood risks, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday. “The No. 1 killer in all of these storms is water, whether it’s the storm surge that’s going to happen at the coast or the excessive rainfall that might happen inland that causes urban flash flooding,” she said. Storm surge accounts for nearly half of all hurricane-related fatalities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says, and is the reason behind most storm evacuations. State and local officials reminded residents they often don’t have to go far – tens of miles, versus hundreds – to get to a safer place. “You do not have to leave the state,” DeSantis said. “Get to higher ground in a safe structure. You can ride the storm out there and go back to your home.” • Evacuations in at least 28 counties: Alachua, Baker, Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hernando, Hillsborough, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Nassau, Pasco, Pinellas, Putnam, Sarasota, Suwannee, Sumter, Taylor, Union, Volusia and Wakulla have all issued evacuation orders, some mandatory. State tolls are waived in Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Lake, Pasco, Pinellas, and Sumter counties, DeSantis said Tuesday. All counties have at least one pet-friendly shelter, the governor added, urging residents to “please take care of your pets.” • Air and train travel halted: Major airlines have canceled hundreds of flights as Tampa International Airport suspended commercial operations Tuesday and St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport Terminal building closed Tuesday afternoon. Amtrak has canceled at least 12 East Coast routes and is modifying others. • Emergencies declared: DeSantis expanded an emergency declaration to 49 of 67 Florida counties on Monday morning. Several local jurisdictions have also declared emergencies. North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia have also declared states of emergency • Power outages expected: DeSantis told residents to prepare to be without power. “If you are in the path of the storm, you should expect power outages so please prepare for that,” the governor told residents Sunday. • Hospital system suspending services: Patients will be transferred from at least three hospitals: HCA Florida Pasadena Hospital, HCA Florida Trinity West Hospital and HCA Florida West Tampa Hospital.",Weather
Why coastal communities should fear storm surge," Almost half of all deaths from tropical cyclones come from storm surge. While many people focus on the wind speed of storms, the danger often comes from the water flowing in from the ocean. “A storm surge is a rise in water level caused by a strong storm’s wind pushing water on shore,” said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. “The wind literally piles up the ocean water and pushes it on the land.” And storm surge accounts for nearly half of all hurricane-related fatalities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Storm surge also can exacerbate flooding. As the water piles up along the coast, rivers and streams that typically drain into the ocean can become clogged farther upstream, forcing water levels to rise. That water doesn’t just leave. Depending on how much water was pushed ashore and the area’s watershed, it may hang around, causing further damage to communities. Due to climate change, storm surge has become an even greater threat in recent years. “Sea levels have risen in most places by about 1 foot over the past century. The higher baseline ocean level allows storm surges to reach even higher, increasing their destructive capabilities,” Miller said. Rates of sea level rise are increasing as ocean temperatures climb to new highs every year, which will continue to increase the threat to coastal communities, especially during significant storms. “Reverse storm surge” also can happen during strong storms. This is when the water actually recedes away from the shoreline back into the ocean as winds push water out of shallow areas. Just before a hurricane’s landfall, the water recedes along the coast as the storm’s winds blow from the land out toward the ocean, exposing land usually under water. Ultimately, that water comes back onshore with much greater force, inundating coastal communities. This can be dangerous because people often will go out to the bare or uncovered land to take photos, grab seashells, etc. But the water can come back in just as quickly as it went out, catching people off guard.",Weather
Here’s what the hurricane categories mean," Once a tropical storm strengthens into a hurricane, it earns a category designation on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale: 1 through 5. Knowing about each category can help predict what damage an incoming storm may inflict – and how best to prepare. The categories are defined by wind speed, with a storm of Category 3, 4, or 5 considered a major hurricane. And damage is exponential as wind speed increases, meaning a strong Category 3 storm could do up to 60 times as much damage as a weak Category 1 storm. But it’s not always as simple as ticking up from 1 to 5. Hurricanes carry many risks not adequately conveyed by the wind speed-based scale, including: • Storm surge – when winds push water onto shore – which accounted for about half of hurricane fatalities between 1963 and 2012, according to a 2014 report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society; • Rainfall-induced flooding and mudslides, which made up about a quarter of such deaths, the report shows; • A storm’s forward speed: Slower storms are more destructive, with strong gusts or rainstorms that pound the same areas for hours or days; • Tornadoes, which can spawn by the dozen from any hurricane. Still, the National Hurricane Center uses categories – set by sustained wind speed – to estimate possible property damage from hurricanes. Here’s what’s expected in each: Sustained winds are enough to blow shingles off roofs and damage gutters and vinyl siding, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. These winds also can uproot trees and bring down branches, causing power outages and more property damage. They can damage power lines directly, too. • Hurricane Nicole, a Category 1 storm, made landfall in November 2022 along Florida’s East Coast and impacted places still then recovering from Hurricane Ian less than two months earlier. Nicole caused significant beach erosion and caused more than $1 billion in damages, according to NOAA. Sustained winds could cause as much as 20 times the damage as those of a Category 1 storm, including extensive damage to a home’s roof and siding. Numerous trees and power lines will most likely be damaged, blocking roads, damaging property and knocking out power for days, if not weeks. • Hurricane Delta struck Louisiana’s coast in October 2020 with winds of 100 mph and made landfall just 12 miles east of where Hurricane Laura had come ashore just six weeks earlier. Delta blew away many tarps on roofs damaged by Laura and did extensive damage to trees, homes and businesses. It also dumped more than a foot of rain across South Louisiana, creating prolonged flooding. Now in “major hurricane” territory, wind damage is much more widespread. Well-built homes and other buildings could suffer major damage, and roofs will sustain heavy damage. Numerous trees will be damaged or uprooted. “Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes,” NOAA said. • Hurricane Katrina was a Category 3 storm that struck during the busy 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It first made landfall along the Florida coast at Category 1 strength before rapidly intensifying in the Gulf of Mexico to Category 5. It weakened before making landfall in southeast Louisiana as a Category 3 storm. Storm surge was estimated at close to 20 feet along the Mississippi-Alabama border, and estimated winds reached as high as 140 mph near Grand Isle, Louisiana. Levee breaches sent water flooding into much of New Orleans, forcing people onto rooftops for rescue. Katrina killed more than 1,800 people, left as many as 600,000 households displaced for at least a month and became the most costly storm on record, according to NOAA. Catastrophic damage can result from these winds. Well-built homes will be heavily damaged, with most of the roof blown away. Trees and power lines will be down. Water and power services could be out for months, with the hardest-hit places uninhabitable for weeks. • Hurricane Ian made landfall in September 2022 along the southwest Florida coast as a Category 4 storm. It killed 150 people and became  the costliest storm on record in Florida. Its enormous size and snail’s pace made it exceedingly destructive, with 150-mph winds that battered coastal communities for hours. Ian brought record storm surge to Fort Myers and Naples, estimated at 10 to 15 feet, NOAA said. For days after landfall, the storm dumped unprecedented volumes of rain across Florida, triggering tremendous river flooding in the weeks that followed. These are the most powerful storms on Earth. Most well-built homes will be destroyed, many stripped to the foundation. Power outages could last for months, and the areas hardest hit could be uninhabitable for months. • Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 was one of the worst storms to ever hit the United States, devastating a whole region after it made landfall near Homestead, Florida. Andrew grew from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 storm in just 36 hours, with maximum winds near Homestead around 165 mph, according to NOAA. At the time, Andrew was the “costliest and most damaging hurricane ever to hit the United States,” the National Weather Service said.",Weather
"Idalia is expected to make landfall in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane with dangerous rain, winds and storm surge"," Tropical Storm Idalia is expected to strengthen into a powerful Category 3 hurricane Monday and could bring potentially catastrophic winds, heavy rain and flooding to Florida’s Gulf Coast later this week, prompting evacuations and school closures in parts of the state. By Monday night, Idalia was “almost a hurricane” as it inched closer to the United States, and a life-threatening storm surge was becoming increasingly likely for parts of of Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was packing 70 mph winds and was roughly 10 miles northwest of Cuba’s western tip Monday night, according to the center. More than 8,000 people were evacuated from western Cuba’s coastal areas ahead of the storm, broadcasters on state-run TV said Monday night. Idalia is predicted to continue getting rapidly stronger until it makes landfall in Florida, turning into a “major hurricane” by late Tuesday, the center warned. Idalia will likely make landfall Wednesday along Florida’s Big Bend – a natural, storm surge-prone divot along the coast stretching from Tampa to just south of Tallahassee. Up to 12 feet of storm surge is forecast there. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were issued for at least 10 counties, including Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, which issued a mandatory evacuation for some coastal areas. And more than 5,000 National Guard members were activated to help respond to the storm. “This is going to be a major impact,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a Monday news conference. In Jacksonville, Mayor Donna Deegan declared a local state of emergency, saying several shelters were opening to accommodate people who may need to evacuate. Follow live updates: Idalia forces evacuations as it heads toward Florida. Key points: Impacts from Idalia will be felt from the Florida Keys to portions of the state’s western coast as soon as Tuesday. Wind speeds will increase across the Florida Keys and the state’s southwestern coast as early as Tuesday morning. Gusty winds are likely across a large portion of Florida, including inland areas, by Tuesday night as Idalia’s outer bands lap inland. A large swath of Florida is expected to experience impacts from Idalia, but the worst of what the storm has to offer will stretch from Tampa northward through the Big Bend region and into portions of the Panhandle. Conditions will deteriorate rapidly in these areas Tuesday overnight into Wednesday morning as landfall draws closer. Life-threatening storm surge up to 12 feet is possible in Florida’s Big Bend which will only be worsened by waves driven by hurricane-force winds in excess of 100 mph. Storm surge, which is when a storm blows the ocean onshore, is one of the deadliest aspects of a hurricane and the reason behind most storm evacuations. “It happens quickly and can endanger you, your family & your home,” the Florida Division of Emergency Management agency warned. During Hurricane Ian, 10 to 15 feet of storm surge wiped buildings off their foundations in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. From Idalia, 8 to 12 feet of surge was predicted, something Michael Brennan, the National Hurricane Center’s director, called “our biggest concern.” “These are areas you don’t want to be in if you’ve been asked to evacuate,” Brennan said. A storm surge warning – which means there’s a life-threatening danger from rising waters – is in effect from Englewood, Florida, all the way north to Indian Pass, including Tampa Bay. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were issued in multiple Florida counties Monday morning, which DeSantis warned would expand. “There are going to be evacuation orders issued in all these Gulf Coast counties in the A and B zones (and) all the barrier islands places that are low-lying on the coast,” DeSantis said. Mandatory evacuations were ordered Monday for Pasco, Manatee, Hernando, Taylor, Pinellas, Hillsborough, Sarasota and Citrus counties for low-lying coastal areas and vulnerable structures. The evacuation orders in Hillsborough County include parts of the Tampa area. “If and when the governor issues an evacuation order, that means your life is in danger,” Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw warned. Tampa International Airport announced it would cease all commercial operations by 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The airport announced it aimed to reopen Thursday morning, after taking stock of what damage the storm left behind. DeSantis expanded an emergency declaration to 46 of 67 Florida counties on Monday morning. Power companies will also start staging personnel on Monday, the governor said. “If you are in the path of the storm, you should expect power outages so please prepare for that,” the governor told residents. The University of Florida announced its campus will close and classes will be canceled starting at noon on Tuesday and through Wednesday. Florida State University said its Tallahassee campuses will be closed Wednesday and classes will be canceled. Florida A&M University also announced its Tallahassee main campus will be closed Wednesday. Schools across the region also canceled class in preparation for the severe weather. Hillsborough County Public Schools announced all classes and activities will be canceled Tuesday and Wednesday. Georgia, too, was preparing for Idalia’s arrival. Gov. Brian Kemp activated the State Operations Center Monday. “Georgia will be prepared for whatever Idalia will bring,” Kemp said. “Rest assured, though the system will likely weaken before crossing our border, we’re not taking anything for granted.”",Weather
Hurricane watch issued for Florida’s Gulf Coast as Tropical Storm Idalia approaches," A hurricane watch has been issued for portions of Florida’s Gulf Coast as the state braces for Tropical Storm Idalia, which is expected to strengthen to a hurricane and make landfall this week. The hurricane watch stretches from Englewood to Indian Pass, including Tampa Bay, according to the National Hurricane Center’s Sunday afternoon update. In addition to the hurricane watch, a tropical storm watch has been issued for the Gulf Coast of Florida from Englewood to Chokoloskee and the Dry Tortugas. The storm is currently located about 100 miles east of Cozumel, Mexico, moving at around 3 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the hurricane center said. Forecasters predict Idalia will slowly traverse the Yucatán Channel over the next 24 to 36 hours, bringing tropical storm conditions to the far eastern portions of Yucatán, Mexico, and the western tip of Cuba through Monday. Idalia is expected to make landfall on Wednesday morning near the Big Bend of Florida as a Category 2 hurricane. “Strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to become a hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by early Tuesday,” reads the National Hurricane Center’s update. “Additional strengthening is likely while Idalia approaches the northeastern Gulf coast. Hurricane hunters are probing Idalia for data as the system intensifies. There is a “notable risk of rapid intensification” as the storm moves through the extremely warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane center noted in an earlier update. Rapid intensification occurs when the maximum sustained winds of a storm increase by 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period. Idalia is forecast to drop 3 to 6 inches of rain on western Cuba, Florida’s west coast, the Panhandle and southern Georgia, with isolated totals of 10 inches, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall may also arrive in parts of the Carolinas by Wednesday and into Thursday. The heavy rain may lead to flash flooding, the center warned, particularly in western Cuba, the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle and parts of the southeast US. Life-threatening storm surge, heavy rainfall, and hurricane-force winds are expected in Florida as early as Tuesday. The bulk of the storm is forecast to move over parts of the Southeast on Wednesday. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged Floridians to “just heed the warnings of your local officials” as the state prepares for Idalia’s arrival. “Our emergency operations center here in Tallahassee will go to a Level 1, 24-hour around the clock,” starting at 7 a.m. ET Monday, DeSantis said. In preparation, 1,100 National Guardsmen have been mobilized and they have access to 2,400 high-water vehicles and 12 aircraft for rescue and recovery efforts, DeSantis said. The Florida Highway Patrol also has 300 troopers ready to deploy. According to the governor, power companies will start staging personnel on Monday. Schools in Hernando County, north of Tampa, will be closed Monday through Wednesday and voluntary evacuations have been issued for parts of the county, according to a Facebook post. “Residents are advised to seek safe shelter with family or friends that reside in a safe structure. If this is not a possibility, a public shelter will open at 12pm on Monday,” said the county in the post. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the storm and will continue to receive regular updates as the system heads toward the United States, a White House official told CNN. Who should pay attention? Anyone living in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, Cuba, and the northern Gulf and Florida coast should monitor the forecast in the coming days. The direction and strength of the upper-level steering winds around this system will dictate where it will move and how quickly. As of Sunday afternoon, a tropical storm warning is in effect for Yucatán Peninsula from Tulum to Río Lagartos and Pinar del Río in Cuba; a storm surge watch is in effect for Chokoloskee to Indian Pass, Florida; a hurricane watch is in effect for Englewood to Indian Pass, Florida; and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Isle of Youth in Cuba, south of Englewood to Chokoloskee, Florida and Dry Tortugas, Florida. DeSantis issued an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency for 33 counties ahead of the potential inclement weather. “The Governor and the Florida Division of Emergency Management are taking timely precautions to ensure Florida’s communities, infrastructure and resources are prepared, including those communities that are still recovering following Hurricane Ian,” reads a news release announcing the executive order. When could it affect the US? By Monday, the system will likely enter the Gulf of Mexico, and move toward Florida. It could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon and hit the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday. How strong could it get? It’s still too soon to tell how strong this system could get or how fast it could strengthen. But it will be tracking through the warmest waters in the entire Atlantic basin – a vast source of energy for a developing storm. Exceptionally warm water can provide storms the fuel needed to strengthen and sometimes undergo rapid intensification. Sea surface temperatures are record warm in the Gulf of Mexico and extremely high across the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Water temperatures need to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit to sustain tropical development, and portions of the Caribbean and Gulf are well above the threshold. A hurdle to development: Warm water isn’t the only factor at play. The tropical system would also need upper-level winds to cooperate. High wind shear – the wind’s change in direction or speed with altitude – can tear a developing storm apart. How much wind shear this potential system faces is a critical factor in its formation and final strength. One forecast model shows more wind shear, limiting its development. Another shows less wind shear, allowing the system to develop. Either way, wind shear may decrease for a time early next week across the far northern Caribbean and eastern Gulf of Mexico, allowing any system that forms to hold together. Meanwhile, out in the central Atlantic, what was Tropical Storm Franklin strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, according to a Sunday update from the National Hurricane Center. This was confirmed via aircraft reconnaissance by the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters. Hurricane Franklin is currently located 575 miles south of Bermuda and is moving relatively slowly at 8 miles per hour toward the north-northwest. “Steady strengthening is forecast, and Franklin could become a major hurricane early next week,” said the center in its update. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher with winds above 111 mph. “Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting Bermuda by Sunday night,” the hurricane center said, noting, “these swells are also likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend into early next week along portions of the East Coast of the United States.” Small variations in Franklin’s track through the weekend will determine exactly how close it gets to Bermuda when it makes its closest pass Monday and Monday night. Franklin’s winds and rainfall will extend beyond its center. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are possible across Bermuda early next week as Franklin makes its closest approach. A few showers and thunderstorms are also possible across Bermuda as Franklin passes.",Weather
Here’s why hurricane hunters fly their planes in weird patterns into storms," Have you ever noticed hurricane hunters’ flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don’t fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don’t just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, ‘Alpha’ is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. “The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it’s the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,” Maj. Jeremy DeHart, meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, said. “The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.” Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the “easier” ones to fly in. “From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the “easiest” to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there’s not a lot of question where the storm center is,” DeHart said. “The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.” The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. “We never know what we’re going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],” DeHart said. “Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it’s closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.” Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a variety of flight patterns to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. “Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,” said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. “The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we’ll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we’ll continue the mission in ‘invest mode’,” DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique flight patterns, with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. “The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,” said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. “The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm’s various quadrants,” Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. “This data helps with predicting a storm’s intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.” For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. “The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don’t have a center to aim for,” Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA’s Aircraft Operations Center, said. “Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we’ll shift back to Figure 4’s based on that newly identified center position.” The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA’s Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. “The flight pattern you’ll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,” Underwood said. “This data helps with predicting the storm’s track.” Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes.",Weather
Tropical system forms that could threaten the Gulf Coast and Florida next week," Tropical Depression Ten has formed near the Yucatan Peninsula in the western Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center, and it could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon that would make landfall in Florida as early as Wednesday. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Yucatan in Mexico from Tulum to Rio Lagartos, including Cozumel. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for the western tip of Cuba in the provinces of Pinar Del Rio and the Isle of Youth. The system is developing as what was Tropical Storm Franklin has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane in the Atlantic. The depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Sunday as it meanders in the Yucatan Channel. By Monday, the system will begin moving north, entering the Gulf of Mexico. The storm is expected to further strengthen on Monday and Tuesday as the system crosses the Gulf, moving towards Florida. The official track calls for the storm to become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and make landfall along the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday. The forecast cone stretches from Tampa Bay to Panama City, and the NHC notes that “that there is significant uncertainty in 3-4 day intensity predictions and [the public] are urged to monitor changes to future forecasts.” The next storm name on the Atlantic’s list is Idalia (pronounced ee-DAL-ya). Who should pay attention? Anyone living in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba and the northern Gulf and Florida coast should monitor the forecast in the coming days. The direction and strength of the upper-level steering winds around this system will dictate where it will move and how quickly. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency for 33 counties ahead of the potential inclement weather. “The Governor and the Florida Division of Emergency Management are taking timely precautions to ensure Florida’s communities, infrastructure and resources are prepared, including those communities that are still recovering following Hurricane Ian,” reads a news release announcing the executive order. When could it affect the US? The depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Sunday as it moves through the Yucatan Channel. By Monday, the system will likely enter the Gulf of Mexico, and move towards Florida. It could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon and hit the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday. How strong could it get? It’s still too soon to tell how strong this system could get – or how fast it could strengthen. But it will be tracking through the warmest waters in the entire Atlantic basin – a vast source of energy for a developing storm. Exceptionally warm water can provide storms the fuel needed to strengthen and sometimes undergo rapid intensification. Sea surface temperatures are record warm in the Gulf of Mexico and extremely high across the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Water temperatures need to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit to sustain tropical development, and portions of the Caribbean and Gulf are well above that threshold. A hurdle to development: Warm water isn’t the only factor at play. This tropical system would also need upper-level winds to cooperate. High wind shear – the wind’s change in direction or speed with altitude – can tear a developing storm apart. How much wind shear this potential system faces is a critical factor in its formation and final strength. One forecast model shows more wind shear, limiting its development. Another shows less wind shear, allowing the system to develop. Either way, wind shear may decrease for a time early next week across the far northern Caribbean and eastern Gulf of Mexico, allowing any system that forms to hold together. Meanwhile, out in the central Atlantic, what was Tropical Storm Franklin strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to a Saturday morning update from the National Hurricane Center. This was confirmed via aircraft reconnaissance by the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters. Hurricane Franklin is currently located 620 miles south of Bermuda and is moving relatively slowly at 7 miles per hour towards the north-northwest. “Steady strengthening is forecast, and Franklin could become a major hurricane early next week,” said the center in its update. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher with winds above 111 mph. “Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting Bermuda by Sunday night,” the hurricane center said, noting that, “these swells are also likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend into early next week along portions of the East Coast of the United States.” Small variations in Franklin’s track through the weekend will determine exactly how close it gets to Bermuda when it make its closest pass Monday and Monday night. Franklin’s winds and rainfall will extend beyond its center. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are possible across Bermuda early next week as Franklin makes its closest approach. A few showers and thunderstorms are also possible across Bermuda as Franklin passes.",Weather
At least five killed in severe storms in Michigan," At least five people have died in Michigan during severe storms that struck late Thursday into the overnight hours, bringing heavy rains, strong winds and at least one confirmed tornado to the region. Just under 660,000 homes and businesses are also without power in parts of Michigan and Ohio early Friday. One woman and two children were killed in a car crash during storms on Thursday night, Kent County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Eric Brunner told local news station WZZM. Two deaths were reported in Ingham County. An 84-year-old woman died after a tree fell on her home in Lansing, Lansing Police Assistant Chief Robert Backus told CNN. Another person died in a pileup accident involving more than 25 vehicles on Interstate 96 near Williamston on Thursday night, the Ingham County Sheriff’s Office said. Several others were injured. Storm conditions caused several vehicles on the interstate to overturn – reportedly pinning some drivers inside their vehicles, Michigan State Police Lt. Rene Gonzalez told CNN. A large and “extremely dangerous” tornado was confirmed near Williamston at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, according to the National Weather Service offices in Detroit and Grand Rapids. The storms marched from southern Michigan into Ohio overnight, threatening powerful wind gusts of up to 85 mph, hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter and possible tornadoes. The severe weather hit a rural area of Ingham County, mainly farmland, Rob Dale with the county’s emergency management office told CNN. Some homes were damaged and some barns were destroyed, he said. “Everyone in a house or a building was fine,” Dale said, noting that the roof of an assisted living center collapsed but everyone inside was safe and uninjured. Officials plan to reassess damage in the county during daylight hours. In the fatal crash in Kent County, two vehicles were traveling in opposite directions when one hydroplaned, resulting in a collision. In one vehicle, the woman and two children were killed and the driver sustained a head injury. The driver of the other vehicle was also injured. The storms left more than 460,000 people without power in Michigan and nearly 200,000 in the dark in Ohio overnight, according to tracker PowerOutage.us. A powerful gust of 70 mph was reported in Detroit Thursday night. The storms come on the heels of an earlier round of heavy rainfall that wrapped up in southern Michigan and northern Ohio Thursday morning, bringing 7 to 8 inches in some places. The earlier downpours halted incoming flights at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport on Thursday and overnight flooding prompted closures of roadways. About 18% of flights originating at the airport were canceled on Thursday, though the roadways were reopened later in the day.",Weather
"Extreme heat kills nearly 2 dozen cattle, forces evacuations from a nursing home and shuts down an ice cream parlor"," Nearly two dozen cattle died in Nebraska, more than 100 Missouri nursing home residents were evacuated and an ice cream shop in Iowa was forced to close as record-shattering heat engulfs more than 20 states. Excessive heat warnings, the most severe form of heat alert, spanned more than 1,100 miles Wednesday, from the Gulf Coast northward to central Minnesota. Twenty-two states were under some kind of heat alert Wednesday afternoon. Temperatures will soar more than 20 degrees above what is typical for late August through the end of the week across the Plains, Midwest and South. Even locations that are acclimated to sweltering summer heat will face extreme conditions. By Friday, more than 65 million people will have experienced a temperature above 100 degrees. This latest heat wave is exceptional even for this record-breaking summer. It’s being fueled by a heat dome, a strong area of high pressure that traps and intensifies hot air at the surface, which has been measured at record levels in multiple states. The dangerous heat forced the evacuation of 117 people at a Kansas City nursing home Tuesday after the air conditioning there failed, the Kansas City Fire Department said. The heat index reached 119 degrees. Seven of the residents were Covid-19 positive and taken to a hospital, KCFD Battalion Chief Michael Hopkins said. The rest were relocated to nine other local facilities, Hopkins said. The heat has also proved unsurvivable for some animals. Twenty-two cattle died in extreme heat Tuesday at a University of Nebraska-Lincoln farm according to Eric Hunt, an agricultural climatologist with University of Nebraska extension. In Des Moines, Iowa, the Black Cat Ice Cream store closed through Thursday, with its owners writing in a Facebook post the “extreme heat is too much for the 100+ year old building that we are in to keep up.” And the temperatures won’t let up: Hundreds of heat records could be set in the coming days as portions of the central and southern US approach temperatures never-before recorded. Scroll down for a day-by-day look at the heat forecast. The core of the worst heat on Wednesday is centered along the Mississippi River Valley and impacts states as far north as Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. Multiple Midwestern cities including Chicago, Indianapolis and Springfield, Illinois, may reach triple digits on Wednesday for the first time in over a decade. The heat index already exceeded 100 degrees early Tuesday afternoon as far north as Minneapolis and Green Bay, Wisconsin. These cities typically experience temperatures in the 70s in late August. Chicago’s heat index climbed to 116 degrees early Tuesday afternoon, which was just short of the city’s all-time record of 118 degrees set on July 14, 1995. On the southern end of the heat dome, New Orleans will make a run Wednesday at reaching or exceeding it highest temperature ever recorded – 102 degrees. The city will only add to a recorded 12 days of temperatures at or above 100 degrees this year, which is more than any other year on record. Portions of the Midwest and Plains will begin to see minor relief on Thursday as the worst of the heat starts to shift south and eastward. Scorching heat will remain in place across the South and much of the Mississippi River Valley, but will expand east to roast the Ohio Valley and more of the Southeast. Record high temperatures may fall from Iowa to Indiana and southward to the Gulf Coast on Thursday. The heat index in parts of Michigan, Ohio and West Virginia could climb into the triple digits on Thursday after being spared from the worst of the heat for several days this week. Friday is shaping up to be yet another brutal day for the southern US, with dozens of records in jeopardy from Texas to the Carolinas. Georgia and portions of the Carolinas will experience heat index values in excess of 100 degrees, while parts of Louisiana continue to deal with values in the 110s. While Louisiana is typically preparing for hurricanes and tropical storms this time of year, the state now faces wildfire threats and a burn ban amid the extreme heat. Heat records were broken in several parts of the state, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the National Weather Service said Wednesday. Earlier in the week, there were nearly 350 wildfires burning across the state, according to Mike Steele, Communications Director at the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP). A massive wildfire in the Beauregard Parish area had scorched through more than 10,000 acres as of Wednesday afternoon, Casey Tingle, the director of GOHSEP, said in a news conference. “We’re dealing with a different type of weather situation that requires everybody to be aware of the burn ban and to do their part to reduce the likelihood that we would have anything that could potentially start a fire,” Tingle said. And the weather offers no relief in sight for the state, as dry and hot conditions are in the forecast, Tingle said, adding: “We desperately need everyone’s help in adhering to” the burn ban. The ongoing heat dome has been the strongest on record in several locations, including portions of Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri according to the National Weather Service offices there. A weather balloon launched Monday by the National Weather Service office in Topeka, Kansas, observed atmospheric data that would suggest this heat dome is record-strong for that location. The same was true in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Springfield, Missouri. The heat index topped 130 degrees in Kansas on Sunday and Monday and reached a staggering 134 degrees on Monday in Lawrence. It also topped 120 degrees on Tuesday in several states including Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. Sixteen elementary schools and a middle school in Denver, Colorado, dismissed classes early due to heat, the Denver Public Schools system announced. Milwaukee Public Schools were closed Wednesday as an excessive heat warning remains in effect for the area, the school district said. All after-school activities, athletics, recreation child care camps, community learning centers and Safe Places are also canceled or closed for the day. The district announced schools will remain closed Thursday and all after-school and athletic programs are canceled. In Missouri, Kansas City Public Schools will release students early for the rest of this week as some of its classrooms don’t have air conditioning units. The heat index in the area could hit 110 degrees. “It’s important to note that many of our secondary schools don’t have AC units in all of the classrooms, and the existing AC units are struggling due to this unusual heat, and are not able to maintain a comfortable temperature within our facilities,” the Kansas City school district said. In Iowa, 100% of Des Moines Public Schools’ classrooms do have air conditioning – and the AC “has been running around the clock to best maintain comfortable indoor temperatures,” the school district said. However, “Most school buses are not air conditioned; riders should expect these vehicles to be warm throughout the day,” Des Moines Public Schools said. And some schools from Chicago to Omaha, Nebraska, have canceled outdoor activities until the extreme heat ends.",Weather
"Tropical Depression Harold triggers flash floods, power outages and tornado warnings as it plows through Texas"," Harold has weakened to a tropical depression as it continues to plow through Texas, triggering flash flooding and tornado warnings as the gusty storm pushes toward Mexico. Harold made landfall as a tropical storm just before 10 a.m. CT (11 a.m. ET) on Padre Island, Texas, with sustained winds of 50 mph and gusts as high as 67 mph, becoming the first storm to come ashore in the United States in the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm now has 30 mph sustained winds, according to a 5 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center, and all tropical storm warnings along the Texas coast have been discontinued. The center of the storm is about 15 miles east of Laredo, Texas, and will continue moving into northern Mexico over the next few hours. Heavy rain and strong winds will continue to slam portions of southern Texas and Mexico as Harold tracks westward. Those winds had knocked out power to around 20,000 customers in Texas as of Tuesday evening, according to poweroutage.us. Harold will be able to dump 3 to 5 inches of rain across South Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday with locally higher amounts closer to 7 inches.  Across Mexico, 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected. The heaviest rain tonight will occur across northern Mexico, where up to 10 inches is possible. Life-threatening surf and rip currents conditions will last across the southern Texas coast through Tuesday, and it’s possible the state may also see a few tornadoes develop. The National Weather Service issued several tornado warnings in South Texas early Tuesday afternoon. The storm is moving across southern Texas as the state continues to battle one of its hottest, driest summers on record. Corpus Christi, Texas, already recorded more rain in just a few hours than it has received for the entire summer, according to National Weather Service data. Widespread amounts of 1 to 2.5 inches of rain fell over the area and points south from Tuesday morning into the early afternoon. While this tropical system’s rains could help quench parts of the drought-stricken state, some of the worst drought conditions – areas of extreme and exceptional drought in Central Texas – might miss out on much of the rain. Texans geared up ahead of Harold’s arrival. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed the Texas National Guard, swift water rescue boat squads, among other emergency resources. Naval Air Station Kingsville ordered those in the RV Park on the installation to evacuate, while voluntary evacuations were called in Riviera, Baffin Bay and Loyola Beach, authorities said. Tropical Storm Franklin is set to slam Hispaniola by Wednesday with life-threatening flooding and mudslides. The storm will also bring heavy rainfall to Puerto Rico. Franklin had sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday afternoon and was located over the Caribbean Sea about 230 miles south-southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The storm made a northward turn early Tuesday afternoon and will continue in that direction until it makes landfall in Hispaniola Wednesday. Franklin will unload very heavy rain across Hispaniola Tuesday through Wednesday and raise the threat of flash flooding and mudslides. Isolated rainfall amounts up to 15 inches are possible. Up to 6 inches of heavy rain could fall in Puerto Rico through Thursday, but the island will escape the worst of Franklin. The Atlantic hurricane season is ramping up. Three tropical systems formed in 24 hours Saturday into Sunday. Harold now marks the fourth in four days.",Weather
2011 Japan Earthquake - Tsunami Fast Facts," Here’s a look at the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March of 2011. March 11, 2011 - At 2:46 p.m., a 9.1 magnitude earthquake takes place 231 miles northeast of Tokyo at a depth of 15.2 miles. The earthquake causes a tsunami with 30-foot waves that damage several nuclear reactors in the area. It is the largest earthquake ever to hit Japan. (Source: Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency) The combined total of confirmed deaths and missing is more than 22,000 (nearly 20,000 deaths and 2,500 missing). Deaths were caused by the initial earthquake and tsunami and by post-disaster health conditions. At the time of the earthquake, Japan had 54 nuclear reactors, with two under construction, and 17 power plants, which produced about 30% of Japan’s electricity (IAEA 2011). Material damage from the earthquake and tsunami is estimated at about 25 trillion yen ($300 billion). There are six reactors at Tokyo Electric Power Company’s Fukushima Daiichi plant, located about 65 km (40 miles) south of Sendai. A microsievert (mSv) is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation dosage. People are typically exposed to a total of about 1,000 microsieverts in one year. The Japanese government estimated that the tsunami swept about five million tons of debris offshore, but that 70% sank, leaving 1.5 million tons floating in the Pacific Ocean. The debris was not considered to be radioactive. READ MORE: Fukushima: Five years after Japan’s worst nuclear disaster All times and dates are local Japanese time.

Hilary moves through western US with historic amount of rainfall," Hilary has triggered flooding, heavy rains and powerful gusts across parts of the western US and Mexico, transforming streets into raging rivers and forcing some residents to flee, and leaving others in need of rescue, even after the storm weakened to a post-tropical cyclone. More rain was expected to fall throughout Monday and Tuesday as officials cleaned up the aftermath. After hitting Southern California on Sunday as a tropical storm – the state’s first since 1997 – Hilary headed into Nevada as its first-ever recorded tropical storm. As Hilary and its remnants moved up the western US, the storm brought power outages, flooding and calls for residents to evacuate or shelter in place. Live updates: Hilary brings major flood risk to California The storm broke rainfall records across Southern California: Palm Springs got nearly a year’s worth of rain with 4.3 inches in 24 hours, one of its rainiest days ever. Death Valley nearly set a record with 1.68 inches, and the Furnace Creek area, which usually gets about two-tenths of an inch in August, got 0.63 inches. And the storm is the rainiest tropical storm system in Nevada’s history, nearly doubling the state’s 116-year-old all-time record, according to preliminary data from NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center. Hilary has released 9.20 inches of rain on Lee Canyon, Nevada, smashing the previous record of 4.36 inches in 1906. Hilary also became the rainiest tropical system in Idaho, Oregon and Montana history. In Montana, Hilary dropped 2.3 inches of rain, breaking the record for the rainiest tropical system to hit the state set by Kathleen in 1976.  In Oregon, 3.29 inches that fell on Morgan Mountain from Hilary broke the old record of 1.35 inches, also from Kathleen. And the 3 inches of rain that fell on Dollarhide Summit, Idaho, from Hilary broke the record of 2.20 inches set by Olivia in 1982. Localized flooding was possible into Tuesday morning across northern portions of the Intermountain West. In Palm Springs, a section of Interstate 10 was shut down for part of Monday while road crews cleared  mud left by floodwaters from Tropical Storm Hilary, but other routes in and out of the desert oasis near Joshua Tree National Park were open. In addition, many freeway off-ramps were limited because of mud, and CalTrans crews are working to clear those in an effort to ease accessibility. Emergency telephone service, which had been down since midmorning, has been restored, the police department said, but an outage continues to affect other areas of the Coachella Valley. “We are not used to this level of precipitation, generally – certainly not in the middle of summer,” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria told CNN on Sunday. “With what we’re expecting, it may overwhelm us.” Here’s the latest: • Heavy rains and some flooding may continue Tuesday morning in parts of the Intermountain West, according to the National Hurricane Center. The rain will cause “mostly localized areas of flash flooding,” the National Weather Service Prediction Center said. Flood watches remained in place Monday night across seven Western states. • Strong and gusty winds were expected in Nevada, western Utah, southern Idaho and southwest Montana, the hurricane center said. Coastal tropical storm warnings have been discontinued. • Some portions of Southern California lost power during the storm but electricity was mostly restored by Monday evening. A total of about 41,000 customers in Los Angeles were without power at one point, Marty Adams, general manager and chief engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said Monday. • People in parts of Southern California should not travel unless they are fleeing an area under flooding or under an evacuation order, the National Weather Service has warned. • Flooding, mudslides and downed trees and wires were widely reported across Southern California on Sunday and Monday. At least nine people were rescued Sunday in a San Diego riverbed, San Diego Fire-Rescue said, with water rescues also reported in Ventura County and Palm Springs. • In Mexico, where the storm first landed, power has been restored to 80% of customers in the three states affected by Hilary, according to the national power company. “379,850 users have been affected, and electricity supply has been restored to 302,134, equivalent to 80%,” said the Federal Electricity Commission in a statement Monday. To the west, Los Angeles and Ventura counties saw “considerable damage” Sunday night amid reports of dangerous flash flooding, and rock and mudslides, the National Weather Service said, adding up to half an inch of rain could fall per hour. Cars were stuck in floodwaters in the Spanish Hills area, the National Weather Service reported. Crowley urged residents to take precautions on the roads. “A relatively small amount of water can sweep a vehicle away,” she said. In Los Angeles, the worst of the storm was over as of Monday morning, according to officials. All weather warnings in the city were canceled. “We are past the brunt of the impact,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Ariel Cohen. Schools in San Diego and Los Angeles are set to reopen Tuesday after closing Monday in anticipation of the storm. Officials canceled classes for the more than 121,000 students in the San Diego Unified School District. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the second-largest in the nation, also shut down Monday. The district spans about 700 square miles, meaning the impact of the storm varied for its students. Schools in the Los Angeles district will reopen on Tuesday, according to superintendent Alberto Carvalho. “Our teams have been scouring our schools, and so far, conditions are pretty good,” Carvalho said. A couple dozen schools have lost phone and internet service, and one school has been impacted by a minor mudslide. “It would have been reckless for us to make a different decision,” Carvalho said of the decision to close schools Monday. “Los Angeles was tested but we came through it and we came through it with minimal impacts, considering what we endured,” said Los Angeles City Council President Paul Krekorian. The Nye County School District in Nevada also canceled classes Monday, with plans to reopen Tuesday. Once a hurricane, Hilary weakened as it made landfall Sunday in Mexico – where at least one person died – then crossed into the Golden State. The storm’s center was roughly 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles around 8 p.m. local time Sunday, moving north with weakened 45-mph winds, according to the hurricane center. The Los Angeles Fire Department fielded more than 4,000 emergency calls on Sunday and responded to about 1,800 incidents, Chief Kristin Crowley said in a news conference on Monday. The calls included a request for help for five cars stranded in a flooded intersection of Sun Valley. One person was safely rescued and no one was injured in the Sun Valley incident, Crowley said. Flood water affected an underground power vault, leading to an outage for about 6,000 customers in the Beverly Grove area, with other outages reported in Hollywood, Hyde Park and Brentwood. The vast majority of city power customers remain unaffected by the storm, according to Los Angeles officials. As the storm barreled through, covering roadways with debris and water, roads were blocked across Southern California by Sunday night. A section of Interstate 8 in Imperial County, east of San Diego, was closed Sunday after boulders came loose from an adjoining slope and fell into the road. In San Bernardino County, a stretch of State Route 127 covered in floodwaters was closed, while a section of Interstate 15 was shuttered in Barstow because of downed power lines after a lightning strike, authorities said. Crews across the region Sunday evening rescued people caught in the storm, including at least nine in a riverbed area in San Diego. “Crews are still looking for more people who may need help. #riverrescue,” San Diego Fire-Rescue said. And Ventura County firefighters searched the Santa Clara River for people trapped in the waters on Sunday night, videos show. The storm led to other disruptions across Southern California, with many parks, beaches and other locations closed as officials called on residents to stay indoors. And Hilary continued to cause damage as it moved into Nevada. In Mt. Charleston, Nevada, the storm brought significant flooding on Monday morning, washing out the roadways. Residents are sheltering in place, the power is shut off, and the Nevada National Guard is on its way to assist, according to a Facebook post from Clark County. West of Las Vegas, rushing water is flowing like a river down Echo Road, leaving vehicles stranded from Mary Jane Trailheads and Trail Canyon, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Emergency crews are evaluating and ask for people to stay out of the area, the service said. California had been preparing for difficult conditions, positioning first responders across Southern California to brace for water rescues in flood-prone areas like wildfire burn scars and deserts amid fears areas unaccustomed to rain could suddenly receive a year’s worth or more, triggering flash floods and landslides. Rainfall totals have been significant: In California, Mount San Jacinto received 11.74 inches from Hilary as of Monday night, while Raywood Flats got 11.73 inches, and Heart Bar got 9.67 inches. In Nevada, Mt. Charleston received 7.80 inches and Lower Angel Peak recorded 6.52 inches. Daily and monthly rainfall records were broken Sunday, with 1.53 inches falling in downtown Los Angeles, 1.56 inches in Long Beach and 2.95 inches in Palmdale, according to the weather service. At least three swift water rescues were conducted in Palm Springs, police department Lt. Gustavo Araiza told CNN. In Cathedral City, a desert community roughly a 110-mile drive east of Los Angeles, at least 14 people were rescued from a senior boarding care facility Monday afternoon after “a blockade” of mud trapped them inside, city spokesperson Ryan Hunt said. All of the people rescued are doing well, Hunt said. The fire department had to borrow a dozer truck from a recycling center so they could carry out the rescue, Hunt said. The department had firefighters sit in the dozer and then had those being rescued sit on top to be brought out of the structure, he added. Despite the “unorthodox method,” everyone stayed calm, he said. Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Los Angeles, experienced steady rain for about 10 hours, with the storm dropping well over four inches of rain on the valley. Parts of Sand Canyon Road could be seen falling into rushing water. As the storm continues to affect the West, officials with Oregon’s emergency management are bracing for possible flooding across portions of the state. “At this point, we’re concerned about the substantial rainfall and the potential for fast-moving water and flooding. Flood watches have been issued for areas of Central and Eastern Oregon,” Oregon Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Chris Crabb told CNN Monday afternoon. “We have reports of minor flooding currently and communities using sandbags to mitigate the impacts, but there have been no requests for state support at this point,” Crabb went on. According to Crabb, the office is working with county and tribal partners. Portions of Oregon are under a flood watch through Tuesday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. “The remnants of Hurricane Hilary will bring periods of moderate to heavy rain to portions of northeastern Oregon through Tuesday,” the weather service said in a forecast message.",Weather
Texas under tropical storm warning for storm expected Tuesday morning," Areas along the South Texas coast are under tropical storm alerts for a system – currently a tropical depression – that could start lashing the area with wind, rain and coastal flooding as soon as Tuesday morning. Tropical Depression 9 formed in the Gulf of Mexico late Monday afternoon, and is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm before its heavy rain and gusty winds spread into southern Texas and northern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm’s center is expected to move inland over south Texas by midday Tuesday, hurricane center said. A tropical storm warning is in effect for portions of South Texas south of Port O’Connor and a tropical storm watch has been issued from Port O’Connor northward to Sargent. If it becomes a tropical storm, it could be named Harold, depending on whether another area in the Atlantic Ocean closer to Africa develops into a tropical storm first. The tropical depression’s center had sustained winds of 35 mph as of 10 p.m. CT Monday, located about 260 miles east-southeast of Port Mansfield, Texas, and moving west-northwest through the Gulf of Mexico. Rough seas, beach erosion, heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes will be possible from early Tuesday through Tuesday night. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico are ripe for tropical development. Sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico are warmer than they’ve ever been on record, according to analysis of NOAA data by hurricane expert Michael Lowry. The water temperatures in the upper 80s give any budding tropical system the ability to thrive. There is also very low wind shear right now in the Gulf. Wind shear is what tears apart tropical systems, so without it, the storm could further develop and better organize. The system will bring heavy rainfall to the Texas coast as well as inland locations, regardless of its final strength. This could help a worsening drought affecting more than 70% of the state, but at the risk of flash flooding. The latest track has the system making landfall well south of Corpus Christi along the south/central Texas coast. South Texas, including Corpus Christi, could generally see up to 5 inches of rain from Tuesday to Wednesday, with as many as 7 inches of rain for some isolated locations, according to the hurricane center, which is urging residents to be prepared for flash flooding. In addition to heavy rainfall, the storm will provide relief from exceptional summer heat in South Texas. In Mexico, generally 4 to 6 inches of rain are possible in the states of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila on Tuesday and Wednesday, with as many as 10 inches possible in isolated locations, the hurricane center said. While this tropical system will bring some beneficial rain to parts of the drought-stricken state, some of the worst drought conditions – areas of extreme and exceptional drought in Central Texas - might miss out on the bulk of the rain. This storm is the latest sign of the Atlantic hurricane season exploding into action. It’s almost as if a light switch was turned on in the Atlantic basin: three tropical systems formed in 24 hours Saturday into Sunday and now the Texas storm is expected to make it four. This is only the third time on record three tropical systems have formed within 24 hours, according to Lowry. While the Gulf system is the most imminent of the tropical threats, two other tropical storms are lined up in the Atlantic Basin. Tropical Storm Franklin poses the biggest threat and is set to impact Hispaniola by mid-week. The storm’s center had sustained winds of 50 mph as of 11 p.m. ET Monday, located over the Caribbean about 275 miles south of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. It is expected to make a hard turn to the north by Tuesday morning and make landfall in Hispaniola Tuesday night or early Wednesday. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the southern side of Hispaniola, while tropical storm watches cover the northern side. There are also tropical storm watches for Turks and Caicos. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated higher amounts up to 15 inches, will be possible across portions of Hispaniola. “The heavy rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as river rises and mudslides,” warned the hurricane center. Across Hispaniola significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into Wednesday. The two other systems in the Atlantic don’t pose a risk to the US or the Caribbean. Gert is expected to fizzle out within the next 24 hours and Emily, which is much further out in the Atlantic, has already fizzled out as well. The frenetic run of tropical activity is expected to continue. The eight-week span from mid-August through mid-October is when ocean temperatures are nearing their highest levels in the Atlantic, wind shear lessens considerably and when nearly 90% of all hurricane activity in the Atlantic happens. “Of course, it remains to be seen what will happen following this flurry of activity, but given the NHC’s tropical weather outlooks, model projections and large-scale conditions, I expect the Atlantic will be quite busy through at least early September,” said Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University.",Weather
‘We’re not built for this.’ Tropical Storm Hilary batters California with heavy rain and catastrophic floods," After making landfall in Mexico earlier Sunday, Tropical Storm Hilary has crossed into California, where it is unleashing heavy rain and turning roads into gushing streams as officials warn of potentially deadly floods. “We are not used to this level of precipitation, generally. Certainly not in the middle of summer,” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria told CNN’s Jim Acosta Sunday afternoon, saying he was worried about potential power outages from the wind as well as flooding. “We’re not built for this kind of rainfall.” Authorities across southern California pleaded with residents not to drive, warning of mudslides, road deterioration and dangerous debris flows and flooding, as some communities declared emergencies to respond to the storm. One California official has warned Hilary could be among the most devastating storms to hit the state in recent years. The National Weather Service said parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties were already experiencing “dangerous flooding” Sunday evening, writing on social media, “THIS IS LIFE THREATENING FLOODING!” Cars were getting stuck in floodwaters and local authorities were conducting rescues, the service said. Hilary’s core – in other words, its center – crossed into Southern California Sunday evening, but the state began feeling the storm’s effects much earlier in the day and rain totals have added up. Parts of Palm Springs saw more than 2 inches of water in just six hours Sunday – nearly half of what they average over an entire year, the weather service said. And with the day not yet over, there were multiple other rainfall records broken Sunday, including in downtown Los Angeles, Burbank and Palmdale. In Palm Springs, the city manager declared a local emergency due to “unprecedented rainfall and flooding,” with city officials saying there had already been one swift water rescue by Sunday afternoon. Live updates: Tropical Storm Hilary to bring major flooding risk to California Though the storm is expected to weaken, it will continue lashing the region with severe weather as it moves further into the US. In Arizona, authorities issued evacuation orders in parts of Lake Mead National Park urging residents to seek higher ground ahead of potential floods. And Nevada’s governor declared a state of emergency Sunday as the storm drew closer. More than than 1,000 flights within, into or out of the US have been canceled Sunday and more than 4,900 have been delayed. The three most-impacted airports are all in Hilary’s range: Harry Reid International Airport in Nevada, San Diego International Airport and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, according to flightaware.com. And as Hilary triggered flood warnings across Los Angeles, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake shook the area and other parts of Southern California Sunday afternoon, according to the United States Geological Survey. More than 7 million people, including those in downtown Los Angeles, are under a flash flood warning through early Monday morning. Parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties could see up to 1.5 inches of rain dumped per hour, the National Weather Service has said. Schools in the San Diego Unified School District announced they would be postponing the first day of the school year to Tuesday. The Los Angeles Unified district, the country’s second largest school district, also said schools would be closed Monday. Hilary weakened from a Category 1 hurricane to a tropical storm before it made landfall over the northern Baja California Peninsula early Sunday. At least one death is already attributed to the storm. A person died when their vehicle was swept away near Santa Rosalía in Mexico, along the Baja California Peninsula, Mexican officials said in a news release Saturday. California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for a large swath of Southern California to support hurricane response and recovery efforts. In a Saturday news conference, Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, warned Hilary “could be one of the most devastating storms that we’ve had hit California in more than a decade.” Parts of California, Nevada and Arizona that are unaccustomed to rain could suddenly receive a year’s worth or more. And along the coast, large swells generated by Hilary are likely to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Death Valley saw triple its average August rainfall in just a few hours Sunday morning. Nearly a month’s worth of rain fell in one hour on Sunday. It normally receives an average of 0.21 inches of rain the entire month of August, but the Furnace Creek observation site reported 0.63 inches since Sunday morning. Roads within Death Valley National Park were expected to eventually become “impassable,” the park said on Instagram, sharing photos that showed floodwaters flowing over roads. The threat triggered California’s first ever tropical storm warning extending from the state’s southern border to just north of Los Angeles – presenting an “unprecedented weather event” to a city with “deep experience” responding to natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes, Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference. “It is critical that Angelenos stay safe and stay home unless otherwise directed by safety officials,” Bass said. “If you do not need to be on the road, please don’t get in your car. Make sure your emergency kit and essential devices are on hand. And ensure that all of your devices are charged in the event of life-threatening emergency.” Residents of the San Bernardino County communities of Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village, Angelus Oaks, and Northeast Yucaipa were all ordered to evacuate Saturday. Visitors and some residents of Catalina Island, part of California’s Channel Islands, were “strongly encouraged” to leave the island ahead of the storm in a news release from the City of Avalon. Meanwhile, helicopters from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office were flying over riverbed areas Saturday afternoon, making announcements in both English and Spanish to warn homeless people about the extreme weather. Los Angeles opened three more emergency shelters Sunday and provided transportation to help get more people to safety before the storm – bringing the total number of emergency shelters opened to eight. California has been particularly focused on preparing residents in areas that typically receive the least rain, or that were most recently scorched by wildfires, authorities said. “We’re keeping a very close eye on our desert regions, east of San Diego and Los Angeles. Some parts of these areas may receive double their yearly amount of water in just a single day,” said Brian Ferguson, the deputy director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. People who live downhill and downstream from burned areas are very susceptible to flash flooding and debris flows. “Rainfall that would normally be absorbed will run off extremely quickly after a wildfire, as burned soil can be as water repellant as pavement,” the National Weather Service said. In Orange County, a voluntary evacuation warning was issued for Silverado Canyon and Williams Canyon in the Bond Fire burn area due to possible debris flows along or near the burn scar. Residents have been offered sandbags to fortify their property in counties across Southern California, where some of the natural buffers against flooding have been burned away.",Weather
Gov. Newsom declares state of emergency for southern California ahead of historic Hurricane Hilary," California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for a large portion of Southern California, as the state prepares for a historic hurricane expected to cause extreme rain and flooding. There are “more than 7,500 boots on the ground” already deployed to help protect from the impact of Hurricane Hilary, according to the release from his office. “Today, Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for much of Southern California to support Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm’s forecasted impacts starting today,” the release read. Live updates: Hurricane Hilary to bring major flooding risk to California The storm, which may pour than a year’s worth of rain on parts of the Southwest, weakened from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1 storm on Saturday night as it advanced toward California, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm has maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, the center said. The storm has sped up and is moving faster than expected, now moving at 18 mph, and is currently located 535 miles southeast of San Diego. Hilary is expected to continue to weaken as it moves north-northwestward through cooler waters toward Southern California. Residents in the Southwest are bracing for “catastrophic and life-threatening flooding” as the system is expected to pummel the region as a rare tropical storm, with the harshest impacts expected on Sunday into Monday. Flooding rain from the storm will start to arrive well in advance of Hilary’s core of stronger winds. Those winds could arrive as soon as Sunday morning, along with more prolific and dangerous rainfall, according to the National Hurricane Center. “Hilary has sped up a bit, along with a slight shift eastward in its track. This results in Sunday morning through Sunday evening being the time frame of most impact,” the National Weather Service in San Diego said. The threat has triggered California’s first ever tropical storm warning extending from the state’s southern border to just north of Los Angeles. The Southwest is forecast to see heavy rainfall through early next week – with the most intense conditions on Sunday into Monday – as Hilary approaches. Parts of Southern California and Nevada could see 3 to 6 inches of rain and as many as 10 inches in some places, the center said. Elsewhere, amounts of 1 to 3 inches are forecast. While Hilary’s core will pack a powerful punch, the NHC warned strong winds and rain will begin far in advance of its arrival. “Preparations for the impacts of flooding from rainfall should be completed as soon as possible, as heavy rain will increase ahead of the center on Saturday,” the hurricane center said. The center of the storm is expected to hit San Diego Sunday afternoon, sometime between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., executive director of the city’s Office of Emergency Services Chris Heiser said at a Sunday news conference. “This is a large storm with a huge footprint and unlike what we usually see in San Diego,” he said. In anticipation of the storm, officials across the region have begun to prepare for perilous road conditions, downed power infrastructure and dangerous flood conditions. Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo announced Friday 100 state National Guard troops will be deployed to southern Nevada, which may see significant flooding. President Joe Biden said in a Friday news conference the Federal Emergency Management Agency has preemptively positioned personnel and supplies to respond in Southern California or other parts of the region, if needed. If Hilary makes landfall in California as a tropical storm, it would be the first such storm to do so in the state in nearly 84 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Parts of Southern California face a high risk for excessive rainfall – also the first Level 4 of 4 threat to be issued for the area. This level of risk is exceptionally rare. From 2010 to 2020, high risks were issued on fewer than 4% of days per year on average, but were responsible for 83% of all flood-related damage and 39% of all flood-related deaths, research from the Weather Prediction Center shows. Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said Hilary “could be one of the most devastating storms that we’ve had hit California in more than a decade.” “Make no mistake,” she said at a Saturday news conference. “This is a very, very dangerous and significant storm.” The state operation center is activated 24/7 to coordinate response operations and take resource requests across the southern part of the state to “ensure that no needs are unmet in their areas,” Ward said. First responders are also prepositioned across the southern part of the state to respond quickly, according to Ward. The state has prepared water rescue teams, California National Guard personnel and flood fighting equipment ahead of Hilary’s arrival, California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said Friday. Highway maintenance crews will also be staffed round the clock in order to aid in roadway safety, the governor’s office said. Electricity utility Southern California Edison – which serves more than 15 million people in the region – said Thursday Hilary is on track to impact much of its service area. The company said it is preparing to respond to outages but urged residents to gather supplies including flashlights, external battery chargers and ice chests. Additionally, roadways may be closed “proactively” out of an abundance of caution to ensure safety, according to Tony Tavares, director of the Department of Transportation. Brian Ferguson, deputy director of the Office of Emergency Services, told CNN Saturday the office is “all hands on deck” for Hurricane Hilary preparation. He said the office is particularly monitoring desert regions as they prepare for heavy rainfall and potential flooding. “We’re keeping a very close eye on our desert regions, east of San Diego and Los Angeles. Some parts of these areas may receive double their yearly amount of water in just a single day,” he said. “Certainly, we are going to be watching very carefully for flash floods, mudslides and debris flows in that area, looking at the burn scars from fires that have happened in recent years.” The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s department issued an evacuation warning for the communities of Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village, Angelus Oaks, and Northeast Yucaipa. Visitors to Catalina Island, as well as residents with medical, access and functional needs, were “strongly encouraged” to leave the island ahead of the storm in a news release from the City of Avalon. As the homeless community is particularly at risk for flooding dangers, officials in both Los Angeles and San Diego say they are performing outreach and offering temporary shelter. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it is also mapping out at-risk encampments and making aerial announcements about the storm. “We hope that the storm does not cause any damage, and more importantly there is no loss of life,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said in a Friday news conference. “But we will prepare for a worst-case scenario, not only to assist people here in our county, but if we are not impacted or affected, we will become a resource to other neighboring counties as needed.” San Diego has also spent the last several days cleaning storm drains, clearing streets and readying equipment, Mayor Todd Gloria said Friday. The storm threat also prompted Major League Baseball to overhaul its weekend schedule in the region, moving Sunday games hosted by the Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres to instead be split doubleheaders on Saturday.  Major League Soccer matches for clubs LA Galaxy and LAFC on Sunday have been rescheduled to later dates. Additionally, Los Angeles officials announced Saturday all the county’s parks as well as aquatic centers, beaches, playgrounds, restrooms and trails will be closed Monday and Tuesday in anticipation of heavy rain and flooding. A Sunday concert slated to feature My Morning Jacket and Fleet Foxes at the Hollywood Bowl was postponed in coordination with the parks department.",Weather
Hurricane Hilary could dump over a year’s worth of rain on parts of the Southwest," Concern is growing Hurricane Hilary will unleash a prolific amount of flooding rainfall on the southwestern US and parts of California as it makes a rare move over the region Sunday and into early next week, triggering a tropical storm warning for parts of Southern California. Hilary could dump more than a year’s worth of rain in parts of three states: California, Nevada and Arizona. Because of the threat, parts of California face a rare high risk for excessive rainfall. This Level 4 of 4 threat is the first to ever be issued for this part of Southern California. Hilary was a powerful Category 4 hurricane churning about 325 miles south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Friday afternoon with sustained winds of 130 mph with stronger gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm underwent incredible rapid intensification Thursday into Friday, strengthening from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane in just 24 hours. Hilary is forecast to remain a Category 4 as it approaches Mexico’s Baja California peninsula through Saturday. Forecasters have issued hurricane and tropical storm warnings and watches for Baja California, including the Los Angeles area and extending as far north as Point Mugu in Ventura County, and northwest Mexico as Hilary’s center approaches through the weekend. There remains a wide range of outcomes for the strongest winds in the US as the storm moves north over the next couple of days. Small deviations in the hurricane’s track could change the forecast for the most intense rain and wind. The hurricane is moving faster than expected, so Mexico and California are also expected to see impacts sooner than early predictions indicated. The center now projects that Hilary’s core will be “very near the central portion of Baja California Saturday night and move inland over southern California by Sunday night.” The NHC also noted strong winds and heavy rains will hit areas far before they see the hurricane’s center. Hilary is more likely to make landfall in Mexico and cross into California, but if it makes landfall in California as a tropical storm, it would be the first such storm to make landfall in California in nearly 84 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The first ever tropical storm watch was issued for parts of Southern California Friday morning, the National Hurricane Center said, extending from the California/Mexico border through Los Angeles County. The watch was changed to a warning in a Friday night update. “The threat of significant wind impacts continues to increase for northern portions of the Baja California Peninsula and the Southwestern United States, especially in areas of mountainous terrain,” the hurricane center said Thursday night. Hilary is expected to substantially weaken before reaching Southern California and parts of the Southwest but, regardless of its strength, the storm will enhance heavy rainfall and increase flooding danger. Heavy rainfall is expected to begin impacting the Southwest Saturday and through early next week, with the most intense downpours likely on Sunday and Monday. It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal the high risks for excessive rainfall is. High risks are issued on fewer than 4% of days per year on average, but are responsible for 83% of all flood-related damage and 39% of all flood-related deaths, research from the Weather Prediction Center shows. Southern parts of California and Nevada could receive 3 to 5 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 10 inches. Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is expected across central parts of those states as well as across western Arizona and southwest Utah. Thanks to Hilary, “multiple years’ worth of precipitation could potentially fall in some of the driest parts of California,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Wednesday. Among those spots is Death Valley, California, the hottest place on Earth. Death Valley typically receives about 2 inches of rain across an entire year, according to NWS data. Moisture from Hilary could unleash enough rain to give Death Valley 1 to 2 years worth of rainfall in a single day. And Las Vegas could get 2 to 4 inches of rain. It only averages 3.75 inches of rain a year. Prolonged rain may oversaturate the ground and overwhelm waterways, potentially worsening the flood threat. Mojave National Preserve, which sits on the California-Nevada border, is closed until further notice due to possible flooding from the storm, spokesperson Sierra Willoughby told CNN Friday. Weekend flood watches have been issued across Southern California stretching from San Diego to Los Angeles as residents brace for potential deluges. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles has also warned of the potential for dangerously high surf, rip currents and coastal flooding. Various county departments have spent the last several days preparing for the storm and have rescue personnel ready for immediate response, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said during a Friday news conference. Luna said a major concern is protecting members of the homeless community. The Greater Los Angeles area is home to around 75,000 homeless people, with over 46,000 within the city limits, according to a 2023 estimate from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. California at large is home to half of all unsheltered Americans, according to federal data. The county is reaching out to people, especially those who stay in parks or near waterways, to provide temporary housing, Luna said. The sheriff’s department is mapping out encampments and making aerial announcements about the incoming storm in addition to outreach teams on the ground, he said. “We hope that the storm does not cause any damage, and more importantly there is no loss of life,” the sheriff said. “But we will prepare for a worst-case scenario, not only to assist people here in our county, but if we are not impacted or affected, we will become a resource to other neighboring counties as needed.” Not to be outdone by the East Pacific, the Atlantic is gearing up for a dramatic increase in tropical activity in the coming days. Four separate areas of concern stretch across the entire basin from west of the Cabo Verde Islands to the Gulf of Mexico. Of most immediate concern to the United States is an area in the extremely warm Gulf of Mexico where atmospheric conditions can come together to support tropical development next week. An area of low pressure may slowly organize in the basin, strengthen and acquire tropical characteristics over the western Gulf by the middle of the week. Three separate areas of concern are in the tropical Atlantic. An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms west of the Cabo Verde Islands may organize into a tropical depression over the weekend and could strengthen further into a tropical storm. Another area of disturbed weather just to the west could become a tropical depression by early next week. Yet another area has a low chance of gaining tropical characteristics near the Lesser Antilles.",Weather
"Hurricane Hilary intensifies to Category 3 strength, threatening significant flooding in Southern California, Southwest"," Hurricane Hilary is rapidly intensifying in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Mexico on Thursday and is on track to deliver potentially significant rain and flooding to parts of the Southwest as a weaker system starting this weekend. Hilary strengthened into a major Category 3 hurricane Thursday evening with sustained winds of 120 mph and even stronger gusts, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm will likely reach Category 4 hurricane strength on Friday with winds of at least 130 mph, the center warned. The hurricane was about 445 miles south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Thursday evening. There remains a wide range of outcomes for the heaviest rain and strongest winds in the US as the storm moves north over the next couple of days along Mexico’s Baja Peninsula. Small deviations in the hurricane’s track could change the forecast for the most intense rain and wind. Hilary’s rainfall could arrive as early as Saturday in parts of the Southwest, with the worst of its impacts set to arrive in California early Monday. Shifts in the forecast track will also affect which areas of northwestern Mexico will face the worst of Hilary’s winds, which will be strong enough to snap trees, down power lines and cause significant damage to property closest to the storm’s center. Mudslides and flash flooding are possible from a general 3 to 6 inches of rain across Mexico’s Baja Peninsula from Thursday to early Monday, with greater amounts possible in the higher terrain. Hilary is expected to weaken significantly before it reaches Southern California and parts of the Southwest, but there’s an increasing chance of significant impacts to these areas in the form of heavy rain and flooding. Southern California could receive some of Hilary’s heaviest rainfall. Widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches may fall there and in southern Nevada from Saturday through Monday. The heaviest rainfall is expected mainly Sunday and Monday. Locally higher amounts up to 6 inches are possible in areas impacted by the heaviest deluges. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible for parts of Arizona, Central California and northern Nevada. Multiple days of heavy rainfall will give the ground little opportunity to absorb moisture and can progressively worsen the flood threat. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Wednesday that “multiple years’ worth of precipitation” could potentially fall in some of California’s driest areas. One of those places is Death Valley, California, the hottest place on Earth. Death Valley typically receives about 2 inches of rain across an entire year, according to NWS data. Moisture from Hilary could unleash enough rain to give Death Valley at least a year’s worth of rainfall in a single day. Rainfall this exceptional proved destructive in Death Valley last year. Around 1,000 people became stranded in Death Valley National Park last August when 1.46 inches of rain fell in 24 hours and unleashed flash flooding that washed away roads and entombed cars in floodwater-swept debris. Despite the flooding danger, the rainfall would help combat drought and recharge groundwater across parched portions of the Southwest. Drought conditions expanded in New Mexico and remained steady in California and Arizona this week, the US Drought Monitor reported Thursday. The seasonal monsoon that supplies the region with a large percentage of its yearly rainfall has been missing for much of the summer, and cities like Phoenix are still waiting for measurable rainfall. The combination of rainfall and increased cloud cover across the Southwest is expected to bring a significant cooldown over the weekend. Temperatures that have been in the upper 90s to 110s could drop by as much as 20 degrees. Phoenix may not reach a high temperature in the triple digits over the weekend for the first time since the middle of June. Hilary is more likely to make landfall in Mexico and cross into California. But if the storm makes landfall in California as a tropical storm, it would be the first to do so in nearly 84 years, and only the third tropical storm or stronger to do so on record, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The most recent was an unnamed tropical storm in 1939, NOAA records show. Before that, the San Diego Hurricane made landfall in October 1858 – California’s only hurricane landfall on record, research shows. 1997’s Nora was the last and only other tropical storm to maintain its status after crossing into California. The current forecast also calls for Hilary to maintain its tropical status as it heads into Nevada, something that has never happened on record.",Weather
What rapid intensification means for hurricanes," When a hurricane undergoes rapid intensification, its maximum sustained winds increase by at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less – driving up the danger the storm could pose to life and property. “Rapid intensification is associated with a sharp increase in intensity in a short amount of time, and consequently, the threat posed by the storm significantly increases,” said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Most major hurricanes – Category 3 or higher – undergo rapid intensification at some point, a 2022 study shows. Of 104 such storms in the North Atlantic since 1990, 88% fit the bill, said Klotzbach, a study coauthor. More and more hurricanes over the period underwent extreme rapid intensification, with at least a 57-mph increase in maximum sustained winds over 24 hours, the study found. While the uptick “may be simply due to better observations, we think that most of the trend is actually real,” Klotzbach said, noting wind speed forecasting has improved in recent years. Because heat helps fuel storms, higher sea surface temperatures and high ocean heat content play huge roles in rapid intensification. So as the climate crisis forces up ocean temperatures, rapid intensification becomes more likely, pushing storms to explode at a rapid pace into deadly hurricanes, scientists say. Scientists are confident hurricanes are on track to get increasingly stronger with rising mean global temperatures, meaning more rapid intensification – along with increased rainfall – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report from 2022 shows. Hurricane Ian in 2022 went from having roughly 115-mph to 160-mph maximum sustained winds in 24 hours, leading to higher storm surge and more damage. It weakened slightly before making landfall as a monster storm, devastating Florida’s coast. Hurricane Ida in 2021 went through a remarkable 65-mph jump in maximum sustained winds in just 24 hours before hitting Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane. It tied the record with Laura in 2020 as the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the state. Hurricane Dorian in 2019 was the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane of modern times and reached the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It underwent rapid intensification twice before becoming the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the Bahamas, where it lingered for days and left catastrophic damage.",Weather
Hurricane Katrina Statistics Fast Facts," Here’s a look at some statistics from Hurricane Katrina. Katrina makes landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana as a Category 3 storm with winds near 127 mph.- Severe flooding damage to cities along the Gulf Coast, from New Orleans to Biloxi, Mississippi.  - Numerous failures of levees around New Orleans led to catastrophic flooding in the city. - About 25,000 storm evacuees were sheltered at the Louisiana Superdome, a sports arena. Wind and water damage to the roof created unsafe conditions, leading authorities to conduct emergency evacuations of the Superdome.  - The total damage from Katrina is estimated to be $125 billion (or $193.8 billion in 2023 dollars), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA report- Direct deaths: 520 - Indirect deaths: 565 - Indeterminate cause: 307- Total number of fatalities: 1,392 In an analysis of 971 fatalities in Louisiana and 15 additional deaths of storm evacuees, 40% of deaths were caused by drowning. 25% were caused by injury and trauma and 11% were caused by heart conditions. Nearly half the fatalities in Louisiana were people over the age of 74. Insurance Information Institute Report Insurance companies have paid an estimated $41.1 billion on 1.7 million different claims for damage to vehicles, homes, and businesses in six states. Nearly 56% of the losses occurred in Louisiana and nearly 30% occurred in Mississippi. By 2007, 99% of the 1.2 million personal property claims had been settled by insurers. The National Flood Insurance Program paid out $16 billion in claims. June 2006 - The Government Accountability Office releases a report that concludes at least $1 billion in disaster relief payments made by FEMA were improper and potentially fraudulent. More than one million people in the Gulf region were displaced by the storm. At their peak, hurricane relief shelters housed 273,000 people. Later, approximately 114,000 households were housed in FEMA trailers. During the first ten years after the storm, FEMA provided more than $15 billion to the Gulf states for public works projects, including the repair and rebuilding of roads, schools and buildings. The agency also provided $6.7 billion in recovery aid to more than one million people and households. The majority of all federal aid, approximately $75 billion of $120.5 billion, funded emergency relief operations. The population of New Orleans fell from 484,674 in April 2000 to 230,172 in July 2006, a decrease of over 50%. By 2022, the estimated population had increased to 369,749, according to the Census. 70% of New Orleans’ occupied housing, 134,000 units, were damaged in the storm.",Weather
"Phoenix’s brutal, record-breaking summer just hit another terrible milestone"," Yet another record has fallen in this summer’s extreme-weather epicenter of Phoenix, but this one is doing more than fueling the heat – it’s a sign of a much more widespread issue developing in the Southwest. Phoenix is experiencing its driest start to summer after recording no measurable rainfall Monday, a new record for the latest start to the region’s monsoon in the city. The troubling new milestone is emblematic of a much larger problem in the Southwest, which relies on the monsoon for much of its rain. Monsoons – which occur in several continents – are seasonal shifts in wind direction that transports moisture into the region. The North American monsoon provides parts of the Southwest 40 to 75% of its annual rainfall, but many cities across the region are pacing 50 to 80% behind average rainfall amounts since June 15, when the monsoon typically begins. This lack of rainfall during a critical time of the year has for weeks enhanced the region’s exceptional heat and expanding drought. Parts of Phoenix did see rain on two days in July, but because it didn’t fall at the city’s official reporting station, it didn’t count toward city records. Only 30 to 40% of the Phoenix metro area experienced the rain, said Alex Young, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Phoenix. That rainfall was light, according to NWS data, only amounting to between 0.1 to 0.2 inches across the two days. These rainfall totals account for at most 10 to 25% of what typically falls during July, and occurred across only a fraction of the city’s footprint. And Phoenix’s rainfall woes have been growing well before the normal start to the monsoon, NWS data shows. Nothing more than a trace of rain has been recorded at the city’s official reporting station since March 22. Monday marked 145 consecutive days without measurable precipitation, further cementing Phoenix’s second-longest dry streak on record. The longest dry stretch on record for Phoenix stands at 160 days and occurred more than 60 years ago from December 29, 1971, to June 6, 1972. Phoenix isn’t the only city missing out on most of its monsoon rainfall. Flagstaff, Arizona, has recorded about 30% of its typical rainfall since monsoon season began and Albuquerque, New Mexico, has only seen around 20%. Minimal rainfall has led to abnormal dryness and drought across at least 95% of New Mexico and 85% of Arizona, the US Drought Monitor reported last week. How long Phoenix’s dry spell will last depends on a brewing stormy setup later this week across portions of the Southwest, including eastern and central Arizona. There’s a chance Phoenix will receive rainfall at some point Friday or Saturday, meaning the 160-day record might not be broken. The lack of rainfall is driving this summer’s heat even higher. Sun shining on dry ground typically results in higher temperatures because none of the sun’s energy is used to evaporate moisture and more of it can be converted into heat. Cloud cover can also have a significant influence as it affects how much sun reaches the ground. Throw in several intense heat domes and a plethora of records have fallen in Phoenix this summer. Phoenix had not only its hottest month on record in July, but also the hottest month ever recorded for any US city. The city endured a record-breaking 31 consecutive days from June 30 to July 30 where high temperatures reached or exceeded 110 degrees. Phoenix has had 43 days so far this year where temperatures met or surpassed 110 degrees, just 10 days behind 2022’s all-time record of 53 days. And the heat hasn’t stopped stop once the sun goes down. Phoenix has had 28 days of low temperatures at or above 90 degrees this year, which ties the record set in 2020. Low temperatures in the hottest part of the summer tend to hover in the low to middle 80s, but one day in July set an all-time record when temperatures failed to fall below 97 degrees. When heat doesn’t abate at night, it can quickly become dangerous – especially for those without reliable access to air conditioning. On average, nights are warming faster than days in most of the US as a consequence of the climate crisis. At least 147 deaths have been attributed to extreme heat in 2023, with a majority of the reported deaths occurring in Arizona. As of early August, more than 100 people had died due to heat in Arizona alone.",Weather
Major heat wave creates dangerous fire potential in Pacific Northwest and Canada," The Northwest US has mostly been able to dodge major heat this summer, but it has arrived with a vengeance and could help to stoke and start wildfires, including in parts of western Canada where hundreds of wildfires are raging out of control. People across parts of Washington and Oregon will face a rare “extreme” level of heat risk through Wednesday with temperatures expected to run as much as 20 degrees above normal. The “extreme HeatRisk” is the highest possible risk level for heat, akin to a “high risk” for tornadoes. It is meant to warn of significant heat impacts, including heat-related illness, and urge preparation. The temperatures are forecast to break records: Portland could hit 107 degrees Monday, which would break its old daily record and tie its hottest recorded temperature for August. Eugene, Oregon, is also forecast to hit 107 degrees Monday, which would shatter its previous daily record of 101 degrees. All told, more 230 heat records could be broken on Monday and Tuesday across the country. Get your local forecast here In addition to the high heat, red flag warnings signaling the increased fire danger cover much of western Oregon and Washington. Low humidity levels and gusty winds will make for prime fire conditions. Roughly 2,600 firefighters are out battling the seven large fires burning across Oregon and Washington. Even small fires, like the Lookout Fire in Lane County, Oregon, can cause issues fast. The 200-acre fire forced evacuations Sunday night, one of two fires forcing evacuations in the county. Weather conditions will cause the fires to easily spread and allow new ones to ignite. The hot conditions are reaching as far north as Canada which is in the middle of its worst fire season on record. Heat warnings are currently in effect for southern sections of the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. The hot, dry conditions also fed more fires across British Columbia, where more than 375 active fires are currently burning. More than half of those have ignited in just the last 24 hours. The exceptional heat also hasn’t let up across the South. The entirety of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are under heat alerts. Excessive heat warnings, which is the highest level of heat alert, include major cities like Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta and Jacksonville, Florida. Heat indexes will be 110 to 120 degrees across these cities. Some temporary heat relief is coming for parts of the South, minus the Gulf Coast and Florida. A cold front will push through the region tonight, dropping high temperatures for a large chunk of the heat oppressed back into the upper 80s to low 90s – a much more seasonal forecast. The low 90s are still hot but will feel like a temporary break from the dangerous heat before it builds back in again by the end of the week.",Weather
Tropical Storm Greg will follow Hurricane Dora’s path. Here’s how it could affect the fires in Hawaii," A new tropical storm south of Hawaii will move along a similar track as Hurricane Dora – the storm that enhanced ferocious winds that drove the Maui wildfires, one of which became the deadliest US wildfire in more than a century. Tropical Storm Greg should pass hundreds of miles south of Hawaii, just like Dora, but its affect on the weather and fire conditions there is expected to be much less severe. Dora was an intense Category 4 hurricane as it passed about 700 miles south of Hawaii’s Big Island early last week. At the same time, a strong area of high pressure was located north of the state. The opposing systems created a strong pressure gradient that enhanced high winds as air funneled between them. Wind gusts last week reached speeds of up to 67 mph on Maui and 82 mph on the Big Island, according to data from the National Weather Service. Even stronger wind gusts likely occurred and were not picked up by limited reporting stations – especially on the west side of Maui, where winds would have become more intense as they descended nearby mountains. The atmospheric setup as Greg passes south of Hawaii Tuesday through Thursday is unlikely to be as intense as what helped to enhance last week’s devastating winds. Greg will be weaker than Dora as it passes south of Hawaii as a tropical storm. High pressure to the north of the island chain is also not forecast to be as strong as last week. This means the pressure gradient and winds will be weaker than last week’s event and more comparable to Hawaii’s typically breezy trade winds. But Hawaii is not in the clear. At least three wildfires are burning across portions of Maui and one is still active on the Big Island as of Sunday night, including Maui’s deadly Lahaina fire, which was 85% contained Wind speeds will increase across Hawaii from Tuesday through Thursday with gusts of 30 to 40 mph expected. Winds of this magnitude can flare up ongoing fires and drive the spread of any new ignitions. Dry conditions are still in place across portions of Hawaii with severe drought reported in parts of southern and western Maui, so fire ignition and spread could happen quickly if given a spark, with gusty winds already in place.",Weather
"Ocean heat is off the charts, so where are the hurricanes? Forecasters warn a change is coming"," Record-high ocean temperatures are setting the stage for an active Atlantic hurricane season with explosive tropical development, but just one thing is missing: storms. There have been no tropical storms in the Atlantic basin in nearly a month, and none so far this year have come close to the United States. But the busiest stretch of hurricane season kicks off in less than a week. And with ocean heat running high, experts are urging people to get their safety plans in place and prepare for tropical trouble that could start within the next couple of weeks. A growing expert consensus is now forecasting an uptick in hurricane activity. An updated outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday called for an above-average hurricane season – an increase from the near-normal forecast it released in May. “We have increased the chance for above normal activity to 60% from 30%,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in a news release. “The chances of a below normal season are now at only 15%.” Rosencrans told CNN there was “moderate confidence” conditions will become more conducive for tropical development within a week or two. And forecasters are honing in on the development potential in the open Atlantic during this time and into September, a forecast that lines up with typical climatology. NOAA forecasters join other experts in the field that have recently increased their hurricane risk outlooks, including researchers at Colorado State University. The forecasts are leaning on several climatological factors, but also on exceptionally warm oceans, which provide storms the fuel needed to explode in strength and even undergo rapid intensification. NOAA said sea surface temperatures were warmer than anticipated, and a major factor in increasing the odds of an active season. “Considering those factors, the updated outlook calls for more activity, so we urge everyone to prepare now for the continuing season,” Rosencrans said. Global ocean temperatures are at their highest levels on record. This is especially the case in the Atlantic, where sea surface temperatures are much above average in areas where hurricanes typically form. Notably, sea surface temperatures in parts of the Gulf of Mexico are in the middle 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit – well above the 80 degrees needed to sustain tropical storm development. Water temperatures have even recently climbed above 100 degrees in shallower water closer to the Florida coast. Even with the abundance of very warm water, no tropical development has occurred in the Atlantic since Hurricane Don dissipated in late July. Despite the lack of US impacts so far, there have been five named storms, putting this season slightly above the climatological normal for tropical activity. And there have been recent signs that the tropical Atlantic could soon spring to life. Several thunderstorm areas have come close to developing, only to be torn apart by two things: wind shear, which is the change in strength in winds in different levels of the atmosphere, and dry air, which can cut off a storm’s lifeblood – its thunderstorm activity. Wind shear and dry air have largely won out over warm ocean water over the past few weeks, suppressing hurricane activity. This is not altogether unusual as wind shear is typically strong at the start of hurricane season and gradually begins to ease through July and into August. But just how much of a reduction in wind shear and dry air occurs headed into the typical peak of hurricane season is in question. Notably, El Niño is present and growing in the Pacific Ocean – an ocean and weather pattern that typically promotes an increase in wind shear and makes Atlantic hurricane seasons less active. Rosencrans said El Niño’s influence had yet to arrive in the Atlantic, but could do so in September. He said there were already signs of wind shear lessening over an area in the Atlantic where storms typically form and that lower than normal wind shear was expected for the season and factored into expectations for an increase in activity. When wind shear lessens and dry air exits, hurricane season will be off to the races with extreme ocean temperatures ready to fuel stronger storms. Take last year for instance: Two storms – Alex and Colin – had already impacted the US by this time last year, but Colin’s dissipation was quickly followed by a lengthy inactive stretch where no additional storms formed in July or August. But once September arrived, along with it came a quick uptick in activity that culminated in devastating Hurricane Ian slamming the US to end the month. Tropical activity spikes across the Atlantic from mid-August to mid-October due to a relative minimum in wind shear and a relative maximum in sea surface temperatures. This period alone accounts for an astounding 96% of all major hurricane days in a season, according to NOAA. Even if tropical activity doesn’t pick up considerably in the next few weeks, any storm that does manage to form over very warm water with no wind shear to inhibit it has the potential to explode in strength and turn dangerous fast. And with hot water in place near highly populated areas of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, disaster can quickly strike if a tropical system is able to tap into that abundant energy.",Weather
‘Like something out of a horror movie’: At least 6 dead and communities decimated in Maui wildfires," At least six people have died in the wildfires that are ravaging parts of Maui, torching entire communities to the ground and leaving behind apocalyptic scenes of ash and debris. Richard Bissen Jr., the island’s mayor, announced the death toll in a Wednesday news conference, but did not offer further details about the deaths and said authorities are still conducting search and rescue operations. So far, more than a dozen people had to be rescued from the ocean, among them two young children, Maui County officials said. Several people are also unaccounted for, Bissen added. And many community members have been gripped with anxiety for their loved ones’ safety after flames began swallowing neighborhoods. “I have not slept in over 24 hours. I spent all night, all through the morning scrolling through my phone looking for family members,” Dustin Kaleiopu, who lost his home to the fire, told CNN’s Erin Burnett Wednesday. In the early Wednesday morning hours, Kaleiopu and his grandfather awoke to howling winds and quickly saw the blaze approaching their home. They fled shortly after 4 a.m. When Kaleiopu’s father went to the home an hour later to check that they had safely evacuated, there was nothing left. “Our entire street was burned to the ground,” Kaleiopu said. The fires on Maui started spreading widely Tuesday – fueled in part by violent winds from Hurricane Dora, churning more than 800 miles away – decimating homes and businesses, launching urgent rescue missions, knocking out power and communication services, and even forcing some people into the ocean to avoid being burned. On Wednesday afternoon, officials on the island urged visitors to leave Lahaina and Maui “as soon as possible,” reporting a mass bus evacuation was ongoing and there were available flight seats. “As a result of three fires that have occurred that are continuing here on our island we have had 13 evacuations from different neighborhoods and towns, we’ve had 16 road closures, we’ve opened five shelters,” Bissen said, noting more than 2,000 people were staying at shelters. “Local people have lost everything,” said James Kunane Tokioka, the state’s business, economic development and tourism director, at the news conference. “They’ve lost their house, they’ve lost their animals and it’s devastating.” Scores of structures on Maui have been burned to the ground, the mayor said. Most of them were in the historic town of Lahaina, a touristic and economic hub on the west side of the island. It’s where Claire Kent’s home was too. “It happened so fast,” she told CNN. “I heard the first explosions of the gas stations exploding and then I saw the black smoke a couple streets away and within half an hour we were out the door.” Kent was at a friend’s home and never got to pick up anything from her house before they evacuated. “We didn’t even realize we weren’t going to get to go back,” she said. But within an hour, the inferno had consumed the neighborhood, and had swallowed cars on the road Kent and her friends were using to evacuate. It was, she said, “like something out of a horror movie.” Bissen said helicopters were using water drops over Maui Wednesday to help suppress the flames. The fires are still not contained. Meanwhile, crews on Hawaii’s Big Island were also working Wednesday to contain multiple brushfires there, including a blaze that was threatening structures in one community and was 60% contained, according to fire officials. Hawaii’s governor, who was on a personal trip this week, said he was rushing back to the state Wednesday. Search and rescue efforts in Maui Wednesday were made even more complicated after the wildfires cut off power and disrupted 911 and other communication services in parts of the island, Hawaii Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke told CNN. “911 is down. Cell service is down. Phone service is down,” Luke said. “That’s been part of the problem, that Maui County has not been able to communicate with residents on the west side, Lahaina side.” Satellite phones have been the only reliable way to get in touch with some areas, including hotels, the lieutenant governor said. The island is home to about 117,000 people. “Our hospital system on Maui, they are overburdened with burn patients, people suffering from inhalation,” she said. “The reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment.” Thousands of animals were also displaced by the fires, the Maui Humane Society said in a Facebook post, pleading with residents who can to foster pets to make space for more animals, including some who may be injured. The disaster also has wiped out power to more than 12,000 homes and businesses in Maui, according to PowerOutage.us. Video footage shot by Air Maui Helicopter Tours over parts of the Lahaina area shows entire blocks were decimated by the flames, with little but ruins and ashes left, and everything still engulfed in a thick, hazy smoke. “We were not prepared for what we saw. It was heartbreaking, it looked like an area that had been bombed in the war,” Richie Olsten, the director of operations for the tour agency, told CNN’s Jake Tapper Wednesday. “It’s just destroyed.” “In my 52 years of flying on Maui, I’ve never seen anything like that in my life,” Olsten added. Tourists are being discouraged from going to Maui, Luke told reporters Wednesday. “Today we signed another emergency proclamation which will discourage tourists from going to Maui,” she said. “Even as of this morning, planes were landing on Maui with tourists. This is not a safe place to be.” Dora, a powerful Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 mph, was about 860 miles southwest of Honolulu Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect. The state likely experienced its most intense winds Tuesday, seeing wind gusts reaching up to 80 mph, said meteorologist Ian Morrison with the National Weather Service office in Honolulu. But those effects are quickly dwindling. Wind speeds lowered Wednesday and are expected to further decrease Thursday and Friday, according to Morrison. “The worst of the winds are certainly behind them as the wind gusts will decrease into the 20 to 30 mph range on Thursday,” CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward said. “Still breezy, but much better than the 50 to 80 mph gusts that were observed Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning.” “Dropping winds doesn’t mean the fires will go away,” Morrison warned, but added the drop will likely help firefighters working to contain the blazes. Little rain is expected on the Big Island and Maui this week, and it will be limited to the eastern side of the island, Ward said.",Weather
Tens of thousands still without power after deadly storms as a new wave of severe weather and flooding hits," More than a 150,000 homes and businesses were still in the dark Tuesday night, more than 24 hours after ferocious storms pummeled much of the Eastern US – leaving two people dead, homes without roofs and drivers stranded for hours. A 28-year-old man died Monday after he was struck by lightning in a parking lot in Florence, Alabama, police said. Authorities have not identified him. In South Carolina, 15-year-old Evan Christopher Kinley was killed when a falling tree struck him outside his grandparents’ home in Anderson County, the county coroner’s office said. In Westminster, Maryland, dozens of people were trapped in cars for up to five and a half-hours Monday after severe weather toppled power lines onto the vehicles on Route 140, state police said. Drivers waited for hours while crews worked to de-energize the power lines to get them out. Jeffrey Campbell was on his way home from work when a utility pole came down on vehicles in front of him, trapping him for hours with live wires on the ground on either side of his truck, he said. The wire to his right took out his exterior mirror, he said. “It’s just poles coming down one after the other,” he said. Eventually, 33 adults and 14 children were rescued. No injuries were reported, police said. The storms that hammered Philadelphia all the way down to Atlanta on Monday may be long gone, but millions of people remained at risk for severe weather, including thunderstorms, across the Plains Tuesday night. Very large hail, strong winds and tornadoes are possible in parts of the central High Plains. Earlier Tuesday, eastern Massachusetts, including Boston was deluged with intense rain, with 1 to 3 inches, falling in just a few hours. Some storms in the area turned severe, producing damaging wind gusts and at least one tornado, the National Weather Service office in Boston confirmed Tuesday. The fierce storms Monday left neighborhoods littered with debris and hundreds of thousands of people in the dark. As of Tuesday night, more than 150,000 homes and businesses remained without power across Eastern states but the majority of outages were confined to Pennsylvania, Georgia and Maryland, according to PowerOutage.us. A day earlier, more than 1 million customers were without power as a result of damaging storms. In Knoxville, Tennessee, the storms tore the roofs off homes, aerial footage from CNN affiliate WVLT showed. And large, dangerous hail pummeled parts of Virginia. In Caroline County, hail the size of a grapefruit (4.75 inches) was reported, the Storm Prediction Center said. That’s the largest hail reported in the state of Virginia since 2002, according to the National Weather Service in Wakefield, Virginia. The storms also disrupted travel Monday. More than 8,600 flights within, into or out of the US were delayed Monday and more than 1,700 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 300 flights had been canceled and more than 2,900 delayed. Brutal storms also hit the Midwest on Monday, including Indiana – where EF-1 tornado damage was found in Dubois and Orange counties, the National Weather Service office in nearby Louisville said. It’s not clear whether the damage was caused by one longer tornado or multiple tornadoes, the weather service said. In Paoli, Indiana, vicious winds Monday ripped the roofs off buildings, gnarled traffic signs and hurled debris across streets, aerial video from CNN affiliate WLKY showed. It could take several days to restore power in Paoli, officials said. The violent weather “pretty much tore up this little town,” Jason Terrell told CNN affiliate WDRB. Terrell’s truck was smashed by several trees. “Just a lot of heartbreak for local Paoli,” he said.",Weather
Powerful storm system kills 2 and knocks out power to more than 1 million homes and businesses," A massive storm system unleashed vicious winds and thunderstorms across the East Coast on Monday, killing at least two people and knocking out power to more than 1 million utility customers from Pennsylvania down to Georgia. In the northwestern Alabama city of Florence, a 28-year-old man died after lightning struck him in a parking lot Monday, police said – a rarity in the US as only about 20 people on average are killed by lightning strikes annually, according to the National Weather Service. In Anderson County, South Carolina, Evan Christopher Kinley, 15, was killed when a falling tree struck him during a severe storm, according to the county coroner’s office. The teen had just arrived at his grandparents’ home and got out of his car when the tree fell, the office said. The storm system brought heavy rain, thunder and violent winds of up to 70 mph throughout parts of the coast from New York to Mississippi – and caused major travel disruptions in the skies. By Monday night, more than 400 reports of strong winds had been made across the region. Footage from CNN affiliate WVLT showed homes in Knoxville, Tennessee, with their roofs torn to shreds and debris strewn about on neighborhood lawns. In neighboring Loudon County, the school district announced one high school would be closed Tuesday due to storm damage it sustained. More than 8,000 flights within, into or out of the US were delayed Monday and more than 1,600 were canceled, according to data from FlightAware.com. The most affected airports included the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, New York’s LaGuardia Airport and the Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, according to the website. Nine simultaneous ground stops, which prevent flights from landing, were in effect at airports, including Hartsfield-Jackson, LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Philadelphia International Airport. Live updates: Damaging storms hit Eastern US And as the sun went down, hundreds of thousands of Americans were without power, with the majority of outages recorded Monday night in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Maryland, according to PowerOutage.us. In Georgia, crews were out as soon as the skies cleared Monday evening and worked to restore power, after uprooted trees and powerful winds, hail and rain downed power lines, according to utility company Georgia Power. And parts of the country that were hammered with severe weather Monday may still not be out of the woods, as new threats could develop Tuesday. A slight risk of severe thunderstorms – a Level 2 of 5 – exists Tuesday afternoon for parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida, as well as parts of Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas, the Storm Prediction Center says. An enhanced risk – a Level 3 of 5 – exists for a smaller portion of the latter three states. Areas at risk on Tuesday will generally be south or west  of where Monday’s damaging storms rages. While that is good news for residents cleaning up after Monday’s mess, it also means more than 5 million additional people are at risk for damaging winds and heavy rainfall on Tuesday.",Weather
Missing monsoon worsens Phoenix heat as Texas drought and fire risk grows," Record dry streaks and a long-lasting ridge of high pressure are teaming up to lock in dangerous heat and trigger an expanding drought across parts of the Southwest and Texas. This is particularly true in Phoenix, which just endured the hottest month on record for any US city and still hasn’t had any measurable rain, even though the monsoon season, which is responsible for bringing the Southwest at least 50% of its annual rainfall, started nearly two months ago. Phoenix is currently experiencing its driest three-month period on record, fueled by the second-latest first rain of the monsoon season. This, in combination with the much talked about stubborn area of high pressure, will keep temperatures in record territory for the foreseeable future. Phoenix needs monsoon rain to break the heat. It brings added moisture, cloud cover and rain which can moderate temperatures, especially from oppressive afternoon highs. It’s getting drier by the day, with nothing more than a 20 to 30% chance of rain through the week. Highs in Phoenix are expected to come down slightly this week – from a scorching 116 degrees on Saturday down to a forecast high of 104 degrees on Wednesday. However, the added monsoonal moisture will bring the humidity levels higher, which means the heat index, or “feels like” temperature, will be higher. It’s a no-win situation right now, unless they get rain. By the end of the week, moisture decreases and so do the chances for rain. And you guessed it: temperatures climb right back up to 110 degrees. The lack of rain is also putting the Lone Star State in a dire drought situation which is causing the threat of fires to grow. “It’s just going to keep deteriorating,” said Logan Scherschel, fire analyst for Texas A&M Forest Service. “There’s a pretty good recipe for a bad week coming up because the fields have been drying out for over a month.” Texas had a really wet spring, which produced a lot of fresh grass growth. Then the summer has been very dry and very hot. Several Texas cities, including Waco, Austin, Houston, Midland, San Angelo and Del Rio, have had little-to-no rainfall during the last few months and are all now experiencing their driest 30-day stretch on record. The heat is also helping dry out the ground even more. El Paso is expected to hit 109 degrees Monday, then hover around 105 degrees the rest of the week. The city has had 30 days this year with temperatures above 105 degrees, breaking the record for the most such days. Austin is also expected to stay around 105 degrees all week. The city endured 11 consecutive days above 105 degrees ending in late July, which was an all-time record. Much of the new grass that grew during the spring is dead now, creating the perfect fuel for the spread of fires. “We’re starting to not only see a lot of fires easily started and carried by the grass, but they’re starting to get what we call significant fires because they get very resistant to control as the brush and trees start burning,” Scherschel explained. Texas has had more than 100 fires burn in the last seven days alone, most of those in the more populated areas of the state from Dallas to Houston to San Antonio. “So even if fires don’t get thousands and thousands of acres in size, a small fire can still impact a pretty good-sized population,” Scherschel said. Much of the state is under heat alerts on Monday. There is also an elevated fire risk for West and Central Texas. “The combination of extremely hot temperatures, 20-30% RH (relative humidity) and very dry fuels has resulted in aggressive fire behavior,” according to the storm prediction center. More than 50% of Texas is in drought, with a small pocket of the most extreme level of drought covering the Hill Country. According to Scherschel, they need rain and a lot of it. “Pretty much at this point, it’s going to take some type of season-ending event, such as like a tropical storm or hurricane to bring a lot of Gulf moisture, a lot of rainfall on a lot of real estate,” Scherschel said.",Weather
Flood emergencies force evacuations and water rescues across the South," Life-threatening flash flooding forced evacuations and water rescues across parts of the South Friday morning. Some of the worst flooding centered on portions of western Kentucky and Tennessee, where multiple flash flood emergencies were issued Friday morning. Flash flood emergencies are a sign forecasters are confident the situation is life-threatening and are the highest level of warning the National Weather Service can issue for flooding. The National Weather Service in Memphis used rare language to describe the risk, calling it a “particularly dangerous situation” and warning residents in places like Union City, Tennessee, to seek higher ground immediately. Rising floodwaters there forced residents of the Green Acres Mobile Home Park, the Davy Crockett Senior Center and some area homes to evacuate, Union City officials confirmed to CNN. Nine to 11 inches of rain had fallen in parts of the area Thursday night into early Friday. Several others were evacuated from their homes in Fulton County, Kentucky, amid a separate flash flood emergency, Fulton County Deputy Brooke Amberg told CNN. Numerous roadways were also flooded in the county after 11 inches of rain fell near Hickman, Kentucky. Torrential rainfall also deluged northern Alabama Friday morning and the city of Oneonta, located about 30 miles northeast of Birmingham, took the brunt of it. Many of the roads in Oneonta were covered with water, with multiple roadways “dangerously flooded,” according to the Blount County Emergency Management Agency. Four people were rescued by emergency personnel in Oneonta after drivers failed to forge flooded roadways, Brandon Horton, the city’s Director of Public Safety confirmed to CNN. Oneonta recorded more than 4 inches of rainfall in less than 3 hours which quickly set flash flooding into motion. The prolific rainfall and flooding happened because of training storms. Training occurs when multiple storms move over the same area one after another, similar to multiple train cars on the same track. Storms of this nature can produce massive amounts of rainfall over the same area in quick succession, rapidly increasing the threat of dangerous flooding. Rainfall rates from these storms reached 2 to 3 inches per hour at times late Thursday night into Friday morning – enough rain to overwhelm almost any drainage system and cause flash flooding. Heavy downpours finally let up early Friday afternoon after slamming the already-soaked areas through the late morning. Any additional rainfall into the weekend could restart flooding across parts of Kentucky and Tennessee.",Weather
Phoenix just endured the hottest month for any US city as historic heat streak comes to an end," One of the most exceptional heat streaks in US history finally ended Monday when Phoenix’s high temperature peaked under 110 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in a month, a cumulative toll that has catapulted the city to the top of the record books. But the heat is far from over for Phoenix and millions of others across the Central US. Tuesday’s high temperature was 108 degrees in Phoenix, or 2 degrees above average. The 31 consecutive days at 110 degrees or above broke the previous record by 18 days. It wasn’t just high temperatures breaking records: The city also set a new record warm low temperature of 97 degrees during the streak. With temperatures warming up to extreme highs and hardly cooling down overnight, July averaged a record-shattering 102.7 degrees for the month, the hottest month on record for any US city, let alone Phoenix, according to the office of the Arizona State Climatologist. “It’s been a year of abnormalities and streaks, so it’s just a testament to just how strange this year has been,” said Ryan Worley, meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Phoenix. July 2023 will go down in history books for many locations across the US southern tier. More than two dozen cities from California to Florida could end up setting records for the warmest July. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Kingman, Arizona, Miami and Las Vegas, have already clinched the number one spot for the warmest July on record. These are just numbers that have manifested into a very real danger for people and animals. Sign up for weekly forecasts and weather news from CNN meteorologists At least 25 people have died from heat so far in 2023 in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, with 249 other deaths still under investigation for a possible heat connection, according to the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. July is typically the deadliest time of the year for heat-related deaths, but this year has been “worse than prior years,” Maricopa County spokesperson Jason Berry previously told CNN affiliate KTVK/KPHO. The fear of a surge in heat-related deaths prompted the Maricopa County medical examiner to bring in 10 refrigerated containers last week to handle a possible overflow of bodies. Twenty-five-year-old farm worker Dario Mendoza was one of the Arizonans that died from suspected heat-related causes in July. He collapsed in a Yuma, Arizona, field on July 20 when temperatures climbed as high as 116 degrees, Yuma County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Tania Pavlak told CNN. Mendoza is one of a legion of outdoor workers who have had little option but to brave the heat and its extreme risk to human health. Multiple people have died in National Parks this year from the heat, police dogs even died from heat-related illness in Indiana after an air conditioning failure, authorities said. Even cactuses are succumbing to the Arizona heat. The end of July did not bring an end to the relentless heat. August will start as July finished with oppressive heat across much of the Central US. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 50 million people from the Southern Plains to the Lower Mississippi River Valley where the “feels like” temperature will reach 110 degrees or more. What is the “feels-like” temperature or heat index? North Texas, including the Dallas Metroplex, could get as high as 111 degrees Tuesday and Wednesday. Heat indexes could climb as high as 115 degrees for New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Even Phoenix will be back in the extreme heat by Wednesday, as the dome of high pressure that’s responsible for creating this massive heat waves shifts once again to the west. Temperatures topping 110 degrees will arrive in Phoenix again by Wednesday. Highs on Sunday could reach 116 degrees so the city will once again be under heat alerts beginning Friday and lasting through the weekend.",Weather
Fire whirls and pyrocumulus clouds: How fire creates its own weather," Substantial fires can make their own weather – and do it in several ways. The most common weather phenomena wildfires can create include pyrocumulus clouds, fire tornadoes and smoke clouds that cause significant cooling. Here’s more about them: Fire clouds are known as pyrocumulus. In Latin, pyro means “fire” and cumulus means “pile” or “heap.” They form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus. Pyrocumulonimbus clouds look much darker than typical clouds because of their large amounts of smoke and ash. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms. And sometimes, lightning strikes generated from them even can ignite additional fires. Fire whirls occur when superheated air near the surface of a large fire zone rises rapidly in an air mass that also spins, much like a dust devil or whirlwind. But instead of dust, the rapidly rising air above a wildfire can accelerate into a very tightly spinning column of air composed of fire. Thunderstorms formed by pyrocumulonimbus clouds can spawn large fire whirls – sometimes called firenadoes – if there is enough instability in the atmosphere. The most extreme example of this happened during the 2018 Carr Fire in California. The wildfire spawned a fire vortex with winds as high as 140 mph and temperatures up to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. However, typical spin-ups from wildfires have a weaker spin and do not normally meet tornado qualifications. The clouds of smoke that wildfires can produce may also serve to cool the environment in some cases. Such clouds can be thick enough that sunlight struggles to get through, leaving the surface much cooler than it would have been if warmed by the sun. These clouds can sometimes produce rain to help put out a fire, though the rain often evaporates before reaching the ground because of the hot, dry environment.",Weather
"Explosive wildfire crossed US-Canada border, forcing evacuations"," An out-of-control blaze burning in northern Washington state exploded in size, crossed the Canadian border and set off a cascade of evacuations over the weekend. The so-called Eagle Bluff Fire has burned thousands of acres on both sides of the border and forced hundreds to evacuate their homes since it ignited Saturday in Washington’s Okanogan County. Evacuations were ordered on Saturday for more than 700 properties in the Canadian town of Osoyoos, British Columbia, after the fire crossed the border. By Monday, that number fell to 192 properties after firefighters made progress fighting the fire, with an additional 2,635 properties in the area under an evacuation alert to be ready to evacuate should conditions change. There are no active evacuation orders for the Eagle Pass Fire in the US, but at least three structures had burned in Okanogan County, Washington, and portions of the county were under a Level 2 evacuation notice – “Be Ready to Evacuate” – according to fire officials. The fire exploded in size due to dry, warm and breezy conditions and has burned through more than 10,000 acres. At least 3,500 acres have burned in Canada alone. The fire remains completely uncontained in both countries, according to Washington and Canadian fire officials. Wind gusts are expected to ease over the area by midweek, which could lend a helping hand to  firefighters. The Eagle Bluff Fire is one in a series of large fires that ignited across the Western US in July. At least 64 large fires are currently burning across nine states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, including the York Fire, which continues to rage in Southern California’s Mojave National Preserve. Still uncontained, that fire has already burned 77,000 acres in California and is closing in on the Nevada border. Weather conditions gave firefighters a slight boost on Sunday night as some rainfall moved through the area and helped slow down fire activity. The United States’ fire season has been pacing below average in terms of acres burned so far this year. As of July 31, 1.1 million acres have burned across the US in 2023, according to the National Interagency Fire Center – well below the 5.7 million acres that had burned to-date in 2022. The US wildfire season may pick up pace as August arrives. Much of the Pacific Northwest is dry and hot, which is expected to continue through the summer, leaving room for increasingly dry fuels and easy wildfire spread. While the US wildfire season has started out slow, that is not the case for Canada, which is in the middle of its worst fire season on record. Hundreds of fires burning across Canada have spread several rounds of hazardous smoke across much of the northern tier of the US this summer. As of July 26, more than 30 million acres of Canadian land – an area roughly the size of Mississippi – have been scorched by wildfires so far in 2023, according to Environment Canada. At least three firefighters have died this summer battling Canada’s wildfires, including a blaze in British Columbia known as the Donnie Creek Fire which claimed the life of a firefighter last week. “I am heartbroken that another firefighter was lost protecting our communities and our province during this devastating wildfire season,” Bruce Ralston, Minister of Forests said in a statement on Saturday. Before this year, the worst wildfire season in Canada in terms of acres burned occurred in 1989 when more than 18 million acres were scorched, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.",Weather
